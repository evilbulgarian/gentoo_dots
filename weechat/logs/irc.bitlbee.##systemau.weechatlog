2016-02-18 12:29:24		[12:29]
2016-02-18 12:29:35	@fsociety	welcome to the rabbit hole
2016-02-18 12:30:02	Sean	I thought it was pretty roomy.
2016-02-18 12:30:25	@fsociety	leave your phone not on silent and you will soon discover
2016-02-18 12:30:28	NicholasB	No problem Sean. Not much has changed. Lots of shit talk and links :)
2016-02-18 12:30:35	NicholasB	I still recommend turning off notifications.
2016-02-18 12:30:51	Sean	Already did :)
2016-02-18 12:31:17	NicholasB	smart man.
2016-02-18 12:31:29	NicholasB	sometimes i wake up and there alite 300 missed messages
2016-02-18 12:32:00	Sean	So what you're saying is you've become a speed reader
2016-02-18 12:34:39	NicholasB	nah. a speed ignorer. :P
2016-02-18 12:35:20	NicholasB	Hows Indiana?
2016-02-18 12:35:26	NicholasB	that's your loc isn' tit
2016-02-18 12:35:33	NicholasB	or am i getting people confused.
2016-02-18 12:36:58	Sean	Yep. Its not too bad. Normal cold February. Can't wait until spring. Well, my spring, your fall :)
2016-02-18 12:38:19	NicholasB	its already cold today for feb. which is normally pretty warm out here
2016-02-18 12:38:25	NicholasB	all gloomy.
2016-02-18 12:39:32	Sean	Damn climate change
2016-02-18 12:39:59	Sean	Well you have a new season of footy to look forward to ;)
2016-02-18 12:41:05	Sean	I actually like footy because its different. American Football is so boring here.
2016-02-18 12:41:30	NicholasB	i'm not a big footy fan. but geelong is a huge football town\
2016-02-18 12:41:37	NicholasB	i live near the stadium
2016-02-18 12:41:44	Sean	Also too many armchair commentators. No one really like to talk tech.
2016-02-18 12:42:46	Sean	Although I did get someone to switch from Windows to Ubuntu Unity. Pretty stoked about that. So far he likes it.
2016-02-18 12:42:54	NicholasB	oh sweet.
2016-02-18 12:43:07	NicholasB	i'm gunna get my little sister on to it by the end of the year
2016-02-18 12:43:11	NicholasB	even if its dual boot :)
2016-02-18 12:43:16	NicholasB	its my goal.
2016-02-18 12:43:23	Sean	Nice!
2016-02-18 12:43:54	Sean	He upgraded to 10 and got super pissed at it and was done with Windows.
2016-02-18 12:44:15	NicholasB	ha.
2016-02-18 12:44:19	@fsociety	Sean: He likes Unity?
2016-02-18 12:44:21	NicholasB	that's a common story i think.
2016-02-18 12:45:07	Sean	He likes it because he doesn't know different. He might start fiddling around but as a new father he doesn't have much time currently.
2016-02-18 12:45:07		[12:45]
2016-02-18 12:45:44	@fsociety	that makes sense :) i thought maybe going to something more window like - for eg. cinnamon might even help the transition be even smoother
2016-02-18 12:46:54	Sean	I was in the same boat as him when I talked to him about it.
2016-02-18 12:47:29	@fsociety	last two days have been exciting in linux tech land. vulkan and what seems like quite a mature release of wayland
2016-02-18 12:47:32	Sean	Now I use @wimpress distro. My wife likes it too.
2016-02-18 12:47:38	@fsociety	the more i see every itteration of wayland i want to install it
2016-02-18 12:47:53	@fsociety	ahh mate
2016-02-18 12:48:09	Sean	Yep.
2016-02-18 12:48:15	@fsociety	yeah i used that for a little bit, then i went back to normal ways :) but its like using the ubuntu i remember i loved :)
2016-02-18 12:48:30	Sean	Runs so silky smooth for me.
2016-02-18 12:48:55	@fsociety	as everyone else knows. i'm all tiling window managers, and terminal windows these days. my gf complains because she cant use my pc
2016-02-18 12:49:07	Sean	Welp. Gotta get back to work. Later.
2016-02-18 12:49:10	NicholasB	Ahhh Ubuntu Martin as I like to call it.
2016-02-18 12:49:13	NicholasB	Catch ya.
2016-02-18 12:49:18	NicholasB	thanks for popping in .
2016-02-18 12:49:42	Sean	That's why I don't fiddle with mine too much. I'll get a different compy to do my own stuff on.
2016-02-18 12:49:51	@fsociety	more people to add to the collection :)
2016-02-18 12:50:04	@fsociety	NicholasB: though clearly you already knew him quite well
2016-02-18 12:50:27	Sean	I like it :)
2016-02-18 12:52:38	@fsociety	the fact i can now talk in telegram in weechat makes life wonderful
2016-02-18 12:55:08	NicholasB	ive never even heard of weechat.
2016-02-18 12:55:11	NicholasB	ill take a gander
2016-02-18 12:55:17	NicholasB	when i get home if i remember.

2016-02-19 07:48:53	MartinWimpress	Mind you, telling popey to do stuff sounds agreeable.
2016-02-19 07:54:00		[07:48]
2016-02-19 08:19:51	Joe	Finally got a screen for the Nexus 5

2016-02-19 08:20:34	PeterMoynihan	I swapped out the one on my nexus 4, wasnt too hard
2016-02-19 08:20:59	PeterMoynihan	(I'm keeping that phone till it's destroyed in a nuclear blast)
2016-02-19 08:23:38	Joe	I've got a Nexus 4 as well
2016-02-19 08:23:43	Joe	It's a great phone
2016-02-19 08:23:52	Joe	But the 5 is better
2016-02-19 08:24:44	Joe	But the Oneplus One beats them both
2016-02-19 08:27:05	Joe	@popeydc @wimpress have you spoken about Beep Beep Yarr on LUP?
2016-02-19 08:27:15	MartinWimpress	Nope.
2016-02-19 08:27:39	Joe	Maybe ask Chris if he'll let you
2016-02-19 08:27:42	MartinWimpress	Graham could join LUP next week.
2016-02-19 08:27:52	Joe	It would be good publicity for them
2016-02-19 08:27:54	MartinWimpress	If he turn's up, he'll get on.
2016-02-19 08:27:56	Joe	Good plan
2016-02-19 08:28:09	MartinWimpress	Relay that message to Graham could you?
2016-02-19 08:28:28	MartinWimpress	point him at @m_wimpress on Twitter if he has question about how to join ewtc.
2016-02-19 08:29:00	Joe	Is it Tues at 10pm?
2016-02-19 08:34:00		[08:29]
2016-02-19 08:40:12	MartinWimpress	Tuesday at 22:00 but we assemble at 21:30
2016-02-19 08:40:31	MartinWimpress	Which he will need to do for a sound check.

2016-02-19 08:55:03	Joe	Graham wasn't active on irc
2016-02-19 08:55:08	MartinWimpress	I'll ping Rotten
2016-02-19 08:55:15	Joe	But I left him a message there

2016-02-19 09:32:27	MartinWimpress	Rottn says Graham join should be fine, but is double checking.
2016-02-19 09:32:27		[09:32]
2016-02-19 09:32:33	Moritz	Whoops. Found two 1:45h long recordings on my phone. Didn't know i accidentally recorded myself. 😕 Weird to hear a big chunk of your day from inside your pocket.
2016-02-19 09:35:05	Joe	Does anyone know the easiest way to get double tap to wake on a rooted Nexus 5?

2016-02-19 14:20:27	@fsociety	i've spent all afternoon reading about lennart poettering and now i think i'm slowly becoming a sociopath
2016-02-19 14:21:39	@fsociety	i do love the comment linus made about him though
2016-02-19 14:23:48	@fsociety	Kay, I'm f*cking tired of the fact that you don't fix problems in the code *you* write, so that the kernel then has to work around the problems you cause… This has been going on for *years*, and doesn't seem to be getting any better… I'm not willing to merge something where the maintainer is known to not care about bugs and regressions and then forces people in other projects to fix their
2016-02-19 14:23:48	@fsociety	project. Because I am *not* willing to take patches from people who don't clean up after their problems, and don't admit that it's their problem to fix. Kay - one more time: you caused the problem, you need to fix it. None of this "I can do whatever I want, others have to clean up after me" crap. Linus

2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:27:59] Hello! Ah that grey grey voice over gets me every time.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-19 22:28:21] I know that name
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:43] well we got gray gray to re do it becuase there are a few name changes.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:49] you'll have to listen out next ep. :)
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:58] hopefully you are just as satisfied.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:33:20] I am sure I will be, just finished listening to #25  now.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:34:08] Oh I forget hash tags aren't numbers anymore.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:34:12] I actually like hearing you say the names... Mainly because you got my last name right. :-)
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:34:35] i think he got it right this time. let me check.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:35:53] may be not perfect
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:36:03] but he's lost the kinch
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:36:14] Oh sweet
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:36:14] and more kinse
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:36:39] That's cool, it's all good. Thanks for checking.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:37:01] no probs. it bugged me too actually. but at the time it was heard to get the whole thing redone.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:37:07] *hard
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:37:54] Yeah I could imagine... Plus with all the names, there are going to be some differences.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:38:12] I'm happy either way
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:38:21] i'm thinking ill get him to redo the list every month now. so its up to date.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:38:35] we used to just cut names in but it was a bit messy.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:38:58] Ohhh, that makes sense
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:39:17] He won't be pissed being asked to do it every month?
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:32] we pay him. he charges accordingly.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:36] its a job to him.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:42] prob doesn';t even know what linux is
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:39:47] Can we send in aliases to be read instead of our real names? Hahahaha
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:05] of course as long as they aren't thinks like dick fart

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:26] he wont swear. one of his rules
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:40:36] Sure, I wouldn't send something rude
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:50] all good.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:41:05] Wow, he's got standards huh?
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:15] so are you an aussie local or from dispant shores.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:26] *distant. I can't type. It's well known around these parts
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:50] if i think about i can. @JoeRess said he's stop being so whiny if i learnt to type correctly.

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NotDan	[2016-02-19 23:45:41] The 90s were great for songs that included a random rap in the middle

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NottheOtherDan	[2016-02-19 23:50:21] One of my favourite things is when you Bork your system trying to install proprietary driver at 11:50 PM.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 23:51:00] ubuntu?

2016-02-20 02:04:50	Moritz	#GCHQ/#NSA have looked through innocents' webcams since 2008, and saved even bedroom shots: https://t.co/HCTQNA8cYg https://t.co/mo7CeldBbt
2016-02-20 02:04:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 02:04:50	Moritz	https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/699697752926765056
2016-02-20 02:05:44	Moritz	Knowing this I can finally sleep safely.
2016-02-20 02:11:00		[02:05]
2016-02-20 03:43:55	Moritz	After listening to #25 I want that Jono reviews Kawai metal. Maybe a segment in Bad Voltage or so.
2016-02-20 03:43:55		[03:43]
2016-02-20 03:48:06	PaulGleeson	It was great
2016-02-20 03:54:00		[03:48]
2016-02-20 04:01:14	PaulGleeson	How's everyone doing?
2016-02-20 04:04:19	PaulGleeson	Just chillin while waiting on a hotdog and milkshake. Thinking about stuff
2016-02-20 04:10:00		[04:04]
2016-02-20 04:11:36	AlanPope	mmmm hotdogs

2016-02-20 04:21:25	Moritz	Congrats on the great music selection in the last episode. Really enjoying it.
2016-02-20 04:27:00		[04:21]
2016-02-20 06:30:42	MartinWimpress	Good start to Friday evening, my running buddy can't make it.
2016-02-20 06:30:42		[06:30]
2016-02-20 06:30:49	MartinWimpress	I could go running.
2016-02-20 06:31:06	MartinWimpress	Or I could watch Jessica Jones.
2016-02-20 06:31:38	PaulGleeson	Jessica Jones is very good
2016-02-20 06:32:06	MartinWimpress	Yeah, I'm about half way through the season.
2016-02-20 06:38:00		[06:32]
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	😡 looked at the website for public transport, it says I need a ticket E. I am late, have to get one in the train, because I only have D and risk getting a fine over 60€. The god of the tickets lectures me about entering the train without a ticket. But sells me one anyway. 😰
2016-02-20 07:31:50		[07:31]
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Realise later that he sold me a D ticket. Get my connection in time. Bus driver double checks my ticket two times. No problem.
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Either the website is wrong, or the employees don't know the price structure. 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Two people inconvenienced: Ticket god has no change left. I have to pay more for a single ticket D, I already had. I lost my breath as well as my dignity to the ticket god.

2016-02-20 15:55:41	Joe	[12:56:49] Because of the unrealistic expectations it gives young people
2016-02-20 15:55:41	Joe	[12:57:15] But maybe that's just her pr people saying that stuff and she's really a stupid bitch

2016-02-21 20:41:07	@fsociety	you still trying to use bsd dan?
2016-02-21 20:46:07	Joe	Ghost BSD is by far the easiest
2016-02-21 20:50:37	NotDan	Got my server hardware setup now, so yeah, diving in to the BSD system now

2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:08:26] Ghostbsd is kinda useless
2016-02-22 09:20:53	Joe	[2016-02-21 22:08:40] Why?
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:09:37] Lacks a community to properly test software outside the main system
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:11:38] I've only ever heard non BSD user talk about it
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:12:48] What about Dragonfly?
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:16:21] Dragonfly is just the freebsd pacakages
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:16:29] Like its the same tree
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:17:57] there was a lot of chatter about it a couple of years ago...
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:18:53] For a tiny project it has an insane speed of development
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:19:15] But they had to drop everything but amd64 to get there
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:20:30] OK, I guess suffer from what most &quot;distro&quot; do, not enough development community
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:21:39] Not really most BSDs have plenty if developers but lack a large community of users to break things and make reports
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:21:56] Of*
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:23:56] Don't know enouiigh about the BSDs...tried PCBSD 2 years ago, for about a month, then lost interest though have use PFsense and Monowall on pcengines boards for a while
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:24:25] Pfsense is great
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:24:53] I agree, by far the best opensource firewall
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:25:47] Apparently pf itself is one of the most common pieces of open source software in the world
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:29:13] Im actually thinking of running a vm of pfsense in my classes this term (for firewall, vpn and webproxy) instead of MS forefront TMG (which is a bloated peice of shit) which we have taught since MS ISA 2004 as our &quot;perimeter security and internet gateway&quot;.
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:30:12] I would, its built to work in pure Microsoft environments
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:32:32] Now that MS is no longer actively creating the Firewall Server I can use other solution, I had an option for Cisco, but I would prefer opensource.

2016-02-22 09:21:01	MartinWimpress	[2016-02-21 22:37:27] PfSense is pretty great. OpenSense is shaping up nicely too.
2016-02-22 09:21:01	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:38:45] Isn't pfSence open? I know they offer support for $, but I thought there was a community version.
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:47:38] Shit
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:47:38] I did a Tristan
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:48:02] There is
2016-02-22 09:21:01	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:48:12] no power brick ?
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:49:39] No I left voice recording going for the last 20 minutes
2016-02-22 09:21:02	Moritz	[00:23:04] It is FOSS with optional commercial support.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	EricT	[00:34:01] good to know....bedtime here....

2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[07:58:21] how is it.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[07:58:30] any why did you scare Stefan off?
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:39] No, we were actually talking about open source for once
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:49] Maybe he had the wrong video about the group
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:55] Idea* not video
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:26] hahah. I would say at least 20 percent of discusiion here is software based :P
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:52] 20 percent gif
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:57] actually
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:23:01] prob 40 percent gif.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:23:45] I'd say less than 10% gif
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:24:08] depends when you're on.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:24:12] :D
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:27:11] I suppose
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:28:00] BTW the latest episode of BSDnow has a really good interview with a guy who has commit rights on freebsd, dragonfly and netbsd
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:28:56] It explain the relationship between dragonfly and freebsd very well
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:29:23] certainly.

2016-02-22 09:34:09	@fsociety	once i met a sysadmin who required two seats and we couldn't sit next to him cause he smelt that bad
2016-02-22 09:34:16	@fsociety	and the worst thing is, this isn't a joke
2016-02-22 09:35:36	@fsociety	clearly a windows sysadmin ;)

2016-02-22 09:40:04	@fsociety	i imagine that pink floyd's the wall is about developers working on windows 10
2016-02-22 09:40:44	EricT	How can you have your pudding if you dont eat your meat?
2016-02-22 09:40:44	Joe	What does his ability to extract metal from its ore have to do with your proximity to him?
2016-02-22 09:43:06	@fsociety	now this conversation just went left of centre
2016-02-22 09:43:06		[09:43]

2016-02-22 09:49:25	@fsociety	layers of fear scared the shit out of me a few times
2016-02-22 09:49:50	@fsociety	layers of fear took me about 4 hours to complete, and firewatch about 5 hours
2016-02-22 09:51:43	EricT	Is @elChupaNibre over his manflu?
2016-02-22 09:52:20	NottheOtherDan	No. It's cranked up a level to full body soreness.

2016-02-22 09:52:29	@fsociety	had it for a week
2016-02-22 09:52:38	NicholasB	smelled is traditionally American, smelt is interchangeable in English. Are you American?

2016-02-22 11:36:43	EricT	WHS issues...
2016-02-22 11:37:05	@fsociety	they're only strippers, they won't care
2016-02-22 11:37:13	@fsociety	it's not like they have any self respect anyways
2016-02-22 11:37:23	@fsociety	they'd probably be high on some amphetamine anyway
2016-02-22 11:37:59	EricT	Meth sweat on my bacon! YUM!

2016-02-22 11:39:59	EricT	You too hardcore, bro!
2016-02-22 11:40:22	NottheOtherDan	Save that RAM!
2016-02-22 11:40:37	EricT	bank it for your retirement!
2016-02-22 11:40:46	EricT	so much ram!
2016-02-22 11:41:39	EricT	McScrooge Duck swimming in dimms!
2016-02-22 11:42:02	@fsociety	im scrooge mcdimm
2016-02-22 11:42:22	EricT	it rubs the dimms on its skin...
2016-02-22 11:42:32	@fsociety	though i'm about to compile ue4 so that should use some ram
2016-02-22 11:43:04	NottheOtherDan	1Gb used - 35Gb free
2016-02-22 11:43:45	@fsociety	actually iv made it so gentoo compiles in tmpfs, so for example compiling firefox can use up to 12gb of ram during compile
2016-02-22 11:43:51	@fsociety	but it speeds it up quite considerably
2016-02-22 11:44:25	NicholasB	I used to run all my firefox and chrome in tmpfs to speed it up
2016-02-22 11:44:32	NicholasB	esp on older laptops
2016-02-22 11:44:52	@fsociety	did those laptops have oodles of ram?
2016-02-22 11:45:07	NicholasB	4 gig in my little netbooks
2016-02-22 11:45:13	NicholasB	enough to make a difference
2016-02-22 11:45:31	NicholasB	also when I had a small ssd in my laptop. and 8 gig of ram I did the same
2016-02-22 11:46:40	@fsociety	ahh. i just use tmpfs during compiling, i really wanted to like palemoon.. but none of the extensions i use are compatible with it
2016-02-22 11:47:49	@fsociety	so now im just alternating between firefox and qutebrowser
2016-02-22 11:48:03	@fsociety	vimb is pretty good but lacks tabs
2016-02-22 11:48:30	@fsociety	i think my biggest thing i need though is vim keyboard shortcuts in my browser, i've gotten so accustomed to it
2016-02-22 11:48:37	Moritz	Fab about why you should leave Windows. (There are 5000 Locky infections per hour in Germany).

2016-02-22 11:48:57	@fsociety	Why you should leave Germany = Fab
2016-02-22 11:49:46	NicholasB	i love how you can almost understand german if you speak English.
2016-02-22 11:50:17	NicholasB	not always. but some sentences are like.
2016-02-22 11:50:25	NicholasB	I KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS ARE TRYING TO BE!
2016-02-22 11:50:48	@fsociety	i would love to watch a german spelling bee
2016-02-22 11:51:14	NicholasB	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq07U0HLuM8
2016-02-22 11:52:33	@fsociety	wish i could watch that right now
2016-02-22 11:52:33		[11:52]
2016-02-22 11:52:45	NicholasB	its not that impressive.
2016-02-22 11:52:48	NicholasB	he's a English kid
2016-02-22 11:52:56	NicholasB	so its his second language and seem pretty simple.
2016-02-22 11:53:13	@fsociety	i want moss from it crowd to do it
2016-02-22 11:53:13	NicholasB	so that's awesome but its not like some genius german kids spelling 29 letter long words.
2016-02-22 11:54:18	Moritz	Searching for Buchstabierwettbewerb on you tube doesn't help either.

2016-02-23 01:39:49	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 18:05:21] Non Aussie here
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:06:13] Im Ausie, shit yeh!
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:06:18] lol
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:24] hello.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:32] actually we have more overseas listeners.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:33] oddly.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:45] 55/45 split
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:00] unless of course our listeneres are using vpns
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:06] in foreign countries
2016-02-23 01:39:49	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:07:23] Strangely specific.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:31] i read stats.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:54] now lachlan. i present the following tale of caution to all new users of this group
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:55] turn
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:59] off notifications
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:08:14] what's the standard deviation?
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:08:17] you'll be a nnoyed and your phone will die.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:08:26] BDSM i believe.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:08:37] Im a non-standard deviate
2016-02-23 01:39:49	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:09:53] Lol OK. I thought I'd sign up to this and a few other channels for tech security announcements. What's the growth rate in listeners from pod release to pod release?
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:11:09] its stalled alittle through xmas. but thats too be expected. but its slowly rising.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:11:33] <br><img id="3">
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:11:41] Lol
2016-02-23 01:39:51	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:11:51] This is not a classic&quot;announcements&quot; kind of channel, more warbly banter
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:12:15] Cool cool.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:12:16] yeah. more like irc but not using legacy technology
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:15:38] I tried to do the whole irc thing but I just couldn't be bothered with the setup with nick servers and stuff.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:17] yeah. i find it feel like a chore to have it running. esp on my phone. plus all my non podcast buddies are on it now.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	TristanJames	[2016-02-22 18:16:21] I haven't seen anyone use a/s/l on here either.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:22] nice and centralised
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:51] thats because i know you're in ballarat, i know you're up for it and i know you're legal.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:18:27] can I hook up tinder to telegram?
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:18:41] in linux? no.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:18:41] My  friends use a combo of hangouts and signal for EFF style private chats.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:19:05] i never understood the attraction of signal because it still eaves metadata
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:19:14] for messages anyway.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	TristanJames	[2016-02-22 18:19:16] Snap.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:27:43] What metadata do you speak of? Signal is just like telegram it seems. If you have two users on signal then by default signal encrypts it. If not it reverts to txt messages. The encrypted message on signal is not sent over a txt message it's a data message rather then a txt. I provide it by 'signalling' someone with out my sim in my phone and they got the message.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:28:34] OK. Then that's my bad. I could have sworn it encrypted text messages like text secure.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:29:47] Text secure and signal are the same thing. Text secure was rebranded to signal. They didn't change the methodology of encrypted messages when they rebranded. 👍
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:09] Ahhhhhh. Well there you go.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:42] I still thought it was just encrypted on the phone though.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:49] But now I know.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:31:28] The only meta data you could claim the signal sends is ip traffic to a server probably outside of Australia. But telegram would be the same problem as well. 😐
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:31:34] NP mate.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:32:41] Yeah exactly. I think where my confusion was is that when I installed it like 4 years ago it fell back to sms
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:32:55] I assumed it was just encrypting the SMS.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:43:56] <br><img id="4">
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:44:30] They clean the tube trains at night so someone drunk that this morning
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:44:44] It's not even 8am
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:46:55] They could have been a night shift worker.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:47:09] Having one on the way home.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:50:01] True
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:50:01] Do you have spesh there?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:50:41] Spesh?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:50:57] Oh that's the beer
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:07] Nah not that I can tell from the can.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:19] We have the green calsberg cans.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:33] But no one really drinks it.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:52:26] I like how all anti graffiti chairs are blue with red green and red markings though. World wide.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 19:07:10] Spesh is 9%
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:08:59] Ahh. Yeah we don't get strong beers in aus as a general rule. It might be a legal thing re: amount of tax.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:10:14] well im frying up some giblets and hearts!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:11:58] Ewww
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:12:06] For the dog I hope.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:13:01] Chilli n lemon, fuck the dogs!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:14:53] *shudder*
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:16:07] Mediterean thing...
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:17:34] Indeed. I mean I know they are in my sausages but they're camoflauged.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:18:28] I celebrate all the innerds!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NotDan	[2016-02-22 20:35:29] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0SU7hF8xLY
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:14:52] So I was considering getting a Vid card upgrade to a GTX970
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:14:59] or 980 but
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:38] but what.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:39] DOOO IT
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:16:42] I may wait, Nvidia is due to release new Pascal Vid cards in April, so might have to put in my old GTX580 to replace one of my blown 770 and limp till available, the new GPUs look amazeballs!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:51] ohhh
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:54] yeah. fair enough
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:15] performance on Pascal looks SUPER!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:30] Quantum leap even!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:17:36] Poor @F_s0c1ety
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:17:45] would that be turbo pascal?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:48] http://wccftech.com/nvidia-gp100-pascal-zauba/
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:17:48] I'll stick with amd
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:01] you mad?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:04] lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:18:24] No just not running any Linux boxes any more
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:18:28] There all bsd
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:36] Voodoo or GTFO
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:19:14] nice name too, GTX1080!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:20:23] I tried BSD, but wine+Nvidia killed my enthusiam...
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:20:25] alas
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:20:39] I'm on dragonfly
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:20:55] The only os with full skylake support
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:21:09] Your telling me this isn't bleeding?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:21:22] skylake's gpu
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:21:33] if i ever run a server I'll go for it. But as a everyday user I can
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:21:39] can't see any benefit
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:21:40] Point stands :P
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:21:52] ditto @F_s0c1ety
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:22:07] I recently got a 970, then oculus announced the minimum for the retail unit. And my mate was egging me to get it cause his VR crazy... But I was like meh, CBF to vr. He was really jelly. Angry jelly :O
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:22:33] im annoyed go i have the 960.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:22:39] Cardboard or GTFO
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:22:43] ill still be getting it.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:23:16] WOW I started a flurry of activity!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:23:23] Steam support for HTC?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:23:39] I should do some research on that thing.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:23:40] Telegram is my soundboard for ideas...lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:23:43] yup. and steammachine too. so linux in effect
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:23:59] I thought you said furry
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:24:24] furries with tentacles or GTFO!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:25:50] anyone want to buy my corsair k70-rgb
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:25:59] im offloading it. too much incompaitiblity
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:26:04] I want a steam controller and steam link so fucking bad it hurts!!! I reckon it's all because valve are valve time plus boycotting AUS from the l4d2 gore mode review rating thingo.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:26:18] Why @enjayembee ?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:26:42] Steam controller is great, when it  doesn't lock my cpu
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:04] its not working properly. freezes boot, i cahnge the polling  and it will work, but the colours wont. i cahnge it to another poll rate and the keyboard just repeats the same keypress.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:13] seems to be after a kernel update.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:27] a keyboard shouldnt be a source of consternation.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:27:31] is it a dual usb?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:35] yeah
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:28:22] you are using both ports?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:28:28] yup
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:28:28] I've even thought about a mail forwarder from the USA to get it. Although it seems some aussie valve loving YouTubers have gotten some hardware.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:28:46] got any us buddies?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:29:13] Yes I got friends but they won't forward it for me lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NotDan	[2016-02-22 22:29:21] I have many US buddies
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:29:22] I had issues with my Ducky at start but that was because of USB KVM, Thje linux doesnt like Emulated Kboard
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:31:46] i'll have some more reading in to it. but i've pretty much done with it. i'll loose like 80 bucks out of the deal but i had it for 8 months .
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:31:48] ehh happens
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:31:55] repalce KVM with a totally non-emulated one and all is good
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:32:30] but it will need the emulation to run the custome software no?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:40:54] it needs emulation for the shortcut keys, but that is only if behind an &quot;intelligent&quot; kvm
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:41:29] hmm. i'll look in to it tomorrow. but if i fail dismally then to the bay of e it goes.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:42:12] to be honest my hundred buck generic cherry mech keybaord is more satisfying to type on.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:42:18] hid device or go home
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:42:25] I still have to plug in my ducky and logitech k700 into a win box to program them, but once done they retain settings in flash
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:42:53] yeah the corsair remeber one setting but wont cycle with out the software. nor will they animate. just light up
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:43:00] I have 2 classic Cherry blacks with touchpads on them,lol

2016-02-23 01:40:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:43:43] 80 because of postage
2016-02-23 01:40:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:43:50] 30 on there own
2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:45:42] well i like em.
2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:45:57] ill prob go down the simple back lit route and just get some nice custom caps

2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:54:37] put the xp wallper on your bsd machine and stare at the blue.

2016-02-23 05:27:45	Moritz	How many german listeners?
2016-02-23 05:34:23	@fsociety	none at all :)
2016-02-23 05:38:44	Moritz	If it is just one, try to get my pi on port 2222 🐙
2016-02-23 05:42:15	Moritz	BTW: do you need to truncate ip addresses in logs? By EU privacy law you can't save whole IP addresses in e.g. your apache access_log. That's why it is a pain to setup Google Analytics lawfully. If you use the FOSS analytics software PIWIK you can just press a button to conform with EU privacy law. So handy. FOSS FTW

2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[07:15:07] @lightonflux I don't see the IPs directly. Libsyn just gives me geographic locations. The last episode had 5 percent of our downloads (round about) from Germany.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	PaulGleeson	[08:06:38] Do ye have 20 downloads
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:07:56] some episode 21 downloads.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:08:00] that's good isn't it
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:08:13] that's like world famous level right?
2016-02-23 08:50:43	PaulGleeson	[08:09:04] Its cool thought and ye continue to improve
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:09:56] we might get 30 dls per episode by the years end.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:10:16] I just got to work an hour ago but it feels like a lifetime.

2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:09:46] <br><img id="4">
2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:09:59] Yes, that's a top menu.
2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:10:05] Yes, that Ubuntu MATE.
2016-02-23 10:13:57	@fsociety	i want Ubuntu BSPWM
2016-02-23 10:13:58	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-23 10:14:04	@fsociety	or Ubuntu WMUTILS
2016-02-23 10:20:00		[10:14]
2016-02-23 10:20:10	NicholasB	wait. so mate is being styled on unity now?
2016-02-23 10:20:32	NicholasB	is there a MUNITY coming?
2016-02-23 10:20:54	LachlanHolmes	i'd say it's one of the many presets that martin likes to include in the settings
2016-02-23 10:21:17	LachlanHolmes	like redmond and cupertino
2016-02-23 10:22:01	NicholasB	im not sure if i mentioned it on a show but i had a far too accurate xp theme on cinnamon one day
2016-02-23 10:22:03	NicholasB	it was scary
2016-02-23 10:23:31	LachlanHolmes	<br><img id="5">
2016-02-23 10:23:31	LachlanHolmes	i just did a google image search for xenial xerus and found this image and thought, it was win 10 for a second :P
2016-02-23 10:24:18	LachlanHolmes	but the start menu is not exactly a cc of win 10 but it's scary close.
2016-02-23 10:24:40	NicholasB	i haven't used 10 yet.
2016-02-23 10:29:33	MartinWimpress	Mutiny is a new panel layout.
2016-02-23 10:29:33	LachlanHolmes	got it at work and here...  only recently got a dual boot setup (2x ssds) for my gaming pc. Otherwise i use antergos for a systen76 lappy and ubuntu mate on my older Lenovo ( actually running the 16.04 alpha) :)
2016-02-23 10:29:54	MartinWimpress	@dibZr Speaks the truth, it is activated via MATE Tweak.
2016-02-23 10:30:10	MartinWimpress	But that top menu can be freely used in any panel.
2016-02-23 10:30:23	MartinWimpress	Imagine that customisation 😉
2016-02-23 10:30:55	MartinWimpress	And the dock, you can plonk it where you like 😮
2016-02-23 10:31:24	EricT	Sorry at work, @wimpress downloaded alpha 2 from the buntus last night...
2016-02-23 10:32:25	LachlanHolmes	@wimpress question for you, if you don't mind. Have you decided on a default launcher ( like gnome do or synapse or something) or really haven't found a good enough one for the task?
2016-02-23 10:38:00		[10:32]
2016-02-23 10:44:02	MartinWimpress	@dibZr Awkward.
2016-02-23 10:44:27	MartinWimpress	I favoured Synapse until it started segfaulting it pants in November last year 😞
2016-02-23 10:44:45	MartinWimpress	So I've built a PPA for Albert. I like it, but it is not quite ready ready.
2016-02-23 10:45:08	MartinWimpress	https://launchpad.net/~flexiondotorg/+archive/ubuntu/albert
2016-02-23 10:45:15	MartinWimpress	But ALbert is shaping up nicely.
2016-02-23 10:45:21	LachlanHolmes	LOOOL for a split second there i thought 'Awkward' was a new launcher i didn't know about :P
2016-02-23 10:45:36	MartinWimpress	GNOME Do looks nice, but doesn't integrate with MATE.
2016-02-23 10:45:44	MartinWimpress	Then there is Kupfer.
2016-02-23 10:45:51	MartinWimpress	Which is dead upstream.
2016-02-23 10:46:15	MartinWimpress	Most likely we will fork Kupfer and modernise it.
2016-02-23 10:46:25	MartinWimpress	But that will not happen into for 16.04 😞
2016-02-23 10:46:27	LachlanHolmes	ok cool cool, so don't expect a laucher for 16.04...
2016-02-23 10:46:40	LachlanHolmes	thats fine thanks for answering
2016-02-23 10:46:44	MartinWimpress	But we will back port it for 16.04 during the 16.10 development cycle.
2016-02-23 10:47:10	MartinWimpress	If Synapse get fixed, I spoke with th dev earlier today, it is a shoe in.
2016-02-23 10:47:22	MartinWimpress	Failing that, we will do something else in 16.10.
2016-02-23 10:47:54	MartinWimpress	Back story, I added MATE compatibility to everywhere it is need to Synapse.
2016-02-23 10:48:03	MartinWimpress	So if it works, it fully integrates.
2016-02-23 10:50:09	LachlanHolmes	:) yeah im currntly using synapse with a config edit to make it work with the super key. for some werid reason in the config gui when you go to set the super key as the hotkey it doesn't detect it. 😐
2016-02-23 10:50:21	LachlanHolmes	anyway thanks for the info.
2016-02-23 10:52:35	@fsociety	systemau website on a minimal browser :)
2016-02-23 10:52:35	@fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/A5FjE.png
2016-02-23 10:53:44	NicholasB	i like that you need to read a how too on taking a screen shot.
2016-02-23 10:53:44		[10:53]
2016-02-23 10:53:45	NicholasB	;)
2016-02-23 10:56:59	@fsociety	it was more so on how to take a screenshot of a window
2016-02-23 10:57:08	@fsociety	i never do that usually
2016-02-23 10:57:13	@fsociety	i didn't realise gimp had that functionality
2016-02-23 10:57:52	LachlanHolmes	what's the browser?
2016-02-23 10:58:03	@fsociety	qutebrowser
2016-02-23 10:58:16	@fsociety	a browser designed if you love vim :)
2016-02-23 10:58:25	@fsociety	well you don't have to use it like vim, but it is recommended
2016-02-23 10:58:47	NicholasB	ive been looking at custom key caps. saw a vim set and thought of you.

2016-02-23 20:03:33	LachlanHolmes	[12:59:30] i'm sure there would be a exponential scale that logs time spent over number of diffenent fillings....
2016-02-23 20:03:33	LachlanHolmes	[13:00:20] yeah my work is strange.. i work 12 hour shifts. day or night. so i get huge chunks of nothing to do time.
