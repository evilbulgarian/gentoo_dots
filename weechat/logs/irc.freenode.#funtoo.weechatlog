2016-01-21 06:00:17	@angry_vincent	but kdenlive built without it

2016-01-21 06:03:33	kensington	before i've always seen the fault of the crash is frei0r being available
2016-01-21 06:04:04	kensington	maybe an automatic in mlt, no way to know without the backtrace ;0

2016-01-21 16:24:11	damex	jwpierce3, why don't you use fstab?

2016-01-21 16:41:32	jwpierce3	damex, yeah that is the problem: Under NFSv3 (type nfs) the _netdev option will tell the system to wait to mount until the network is available. With a type of nfs4 this option is ignored, but can be used with mount -O _netdev in scripts later. Currently Ubuntu Server does not come with the scripts needed to auto-mount nfs4 entries in /etc/fstab after the network is up.
2016-01-21 16:45:34	damex	jwpierce3, ubuntu server?

2016-01-22 05:08:12	palo	how to find out my profile on funtoo ? eselect profile show does not work,
2016-01-22 05:08:14	palo	it says
2016-01-22 05:08:28	palo	ah epro is a root command
2016-01-22 05:08:34	@angry_vincent	epro list

2016-01-22 05:10:54	palo	the profile in funtoo is different from the profiles in gentoo right?
2016-01-22 05:11:08	palo	in gentoo a profile is something like gentoo-2012 or something right?
2016-01-22 05:11:37	@angry_vincent	yes, its different
2016-01-22 05:11:57	palo	Ok, than here is my problem
2016-01-22 05:13:01	palo	I have (-mmx) as compile flags (for emerge -v -p mlt) but in my makefile I configured mmx to be one of my CPU_FLAGS_X86
2016-01-22 05:13:23	palo	in #gentoo-dev-help, they said this means some of my profiles is masking that flag.
2016-01-22 05:13:39	palo	how to find out which one? grep on the files?
2016-01-22 05:13:44	@angry_vincent	this is weird
2016-01-22 05:13:58	@angry_vincent	mmx is default enabled on all (almost) files
2016-01-22 05:14:18	@angry_vincent	ehr, profiles, not files
2016-01-22 05:14:25	@angry_vincent	palo: show epro list
2016-01-22 05:15:11	palo	angry_vincent: http://pastebin.com/k6tmG2xm
2016-01-22 05:16:41	@angry_vincent	palo: epro show subarch
2016-01-22 05:16:49	palo	don't have a subarch
2016-01-22 05:16:52	palo	its empty
2016-01-22 05:17:38	@angry_vincent	ok, not sure why it's empty but you need to specify one
2016-01-22 05:17:56	palo	angry_vincent: ok,
2016-01-22 05:18:15	palo	I'll do and see if the problem still exists.
2016-01-22 05:19:16	@angry_vincent	palo: http://www.funtoo.org/Subarches
2016-01-22 05:20:07	palo	i have a core2_64
2016-01-22 05:21:33	@angry_vincent	epro subarch core2_64
2016-01-22 05:21:36	palo	so what about the CPU_FLAGS_X86 variable in the make.conf, could I remove it?
2016-01-22 05:21:39	@angry_vincent	shoudl do the thing
2016-01-22 05:21:49	@angry_vincent	yes, you can remove
2016-01-22 05:21:54	@angry_vincent	see a table for core2_64
2016-01-22 05:22:07	@angry_vincent	in wiki
2016-01-22 05:22:18	@angry_vincent	unless you want hand-crafted setting
2016-01-22 05:22:43	@angry_vincent	http://www.funtoo.org/Core2_64
2016-01-22 05:22:55	@angry_vincent	CPU_FLAGS (see CPU_FLAGS for more info)mmx mmxext sse sse2 sse3 ssse3
2016-01-22 05:23:12	palo	(same I have in my make.conf ^^)
2016-01-22 05:23:25	@angry_vincent	okey
2016-01-22 05:23:42	@angry_vincent	then setting subarch by epro shoudl be sufficient
2016-01-22 05:23:51	@angry_vincent	for mmx USE to appear
2016-01-22 05:24:11	palo	nice
2016-01-22 05:24:24	palo	let's see if emerge -v -p mlt works
2016-01-22 05:24:52	palo	hmm still (-mmx)
2016-01-22 05:25:19	@angry_vincent	grep -r mmx /etc/portage/
2016-01-22 05:26:33	palo	just in the make.conf (removing it now)
2016-01-22 05:27:01	palo	nope still (-mmx)
2016-01-22 05:27:04	@angry_vincent	then it will not fix
2016-01-22 05:28:33	@angry_vincent	did you install from scratch or updated very old box or did live migration from gentoo to funtoo (or alike)

2016-01-22 05:28:53	palo	installed from scratch
2016-01-22 05:29:18	palo	i grepped in /usr/portage/profile, could find this ./arch/amd64/use.mask:-mmx
2016-01-22 05:29:23	palo	./arch/amd64/use.mask:-cpu_flags_x86_mmx
2016-01-22 05:29:58	@angry_vincent	ok, that means that it should be enabled and not disabled
2016-01-22 05:30:09	@angry_vincent	what stage did you use and how did you install?
2016-01-22 05:30:27	@angry_vincent	becuase missing subarch is something unusual
2016-01-22 05:30:46	palo	I installed around 1 1/2 years ago
2016-01-22 05:31:30	palo	my build is current
2016-01-22 05:31:43	@angry_vincent	then you trying to update from 1 1/2 year or kept box updated regularly?
2016-01-22 05:31:56	palo	now
2016-01-22 05:32:00	palo	nooooo :D
2016-01-22 05:32:00	palo	lol
2016-01-22 05:32:06	@angry_vincent	what is now?

2016-01-22 05:32:38	@angry_vincent	okey
2016-01-22 05:32:57	@angry_vincent	then disappearing of subarch need a research on your side
2016-01-22 05:33:10	@angry_vincent	what you did, etc
2016-01-22 05:33:12	@angry_vincent	logs
2016-01-22 05:33:20	@angry_vincent	emerge logs
2016-01-22 05:33:41	@angry_vincent	it's hard to track
2016-01-22 05:33:56	@angry_vincent	but what you can try is to dump portage tree
2016-01-22 05:34:00	palo	I can't remember anything about setting subarch in the first place, back than I had to put the CPU_FLAGS_X86 in the USE variable.
2016-01-22 05:34:05	@angry_vincent	and sync from scratch
2016-01-22 05:34:31	@angry_vincent	mv /usr/portage /ur/portage.old
2016-01-22 05:34:37	@angry_vincent	emerge --sync

2016-01-22 05:38:06	palo	Well they marked it stable a while ago.
2016-01-22 05:38:10	palo	but ok.
2016-01-22 05:38:14	@angry_vincent	palo: idea is to remove portage tree, not partitions
2016-01-22 05:38:31	@angry_vincent	unless your portage tree is in partition
2016-01-22 05:39:04	palo	It is

2016-01-22 05:48:03	palo	I experianced that in NixOS a while ago, and liked it a lot. But NixOS has other problems.
2016-01-22 05:48:14	maraku	you'll have to ask someone with more experience working with lvm snapshots

2016-01-22 06:23:53	mitzip	well it's been in gentoo and so I figured there might be a problem we ran into here... if it's just a matter of man power to bump it... I'll give it a shot this weekend
2016-01-22 06:24:40	xemacs	also debian
2016-01-22 06:25:49	@angry_vincent	a prblem is that it has incompatible ABI changes
2016-01-22 06:25:59	mitzip	that's what I was thinking
2016-01-22 06:26:05	@angry_vincent	no way to dig into it and wste rest of year
2016-01-22 06:26:21	@angry_vincent	update to it will come eventually
2016-01-22 06:26:32	@angry_vincent	but it's not ready
2016-01-22 06:27:28	@angry_vincent	stable compiler is the n option
2016-01-22 06:27:44	mitzip	angry_vincent: danke for the clarification
2016-01-22 06:27:48	mitzip	n option?
2016-01-22 06:27:53	@angry_vincent	an option
2016-01-22 06:29:24	@angry_vincent	mitzip: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566328 for a reflection
2016-01-22 06:32:20	mitzip	angry_vincent: excellent, thanks... checking it out
2016-01-22 06:32:43	@angry_vincent	problem is rather complex
2016-01-22 06:32:47	@angry_vincent	very
2016-01-22 06:33:06	@angry_vincent	assuming the way gentoo treating toolchain
2016-01-22 06:33:22	@angry_vincent	and that fixes are workarounds
2016-01-22 06:34:19	Digit	my answers looked spammy ?_?  no forum account for me.  just wanted to post a quick thread before i fell asleep

2016-01-24 10:38:04	lambd0x	znac: I'm gonna try the other mtp implementations suggested in gentoo wiki. Yes, for I emerged libmtp...its a mtpfs dependencie
2016-01-24 10:38:24	znac	gotcha

2016-01-24 10:40:04	lambd0x	Ok, I'll :)

2016-01-24 10:44:48	lambd0x	znac: Agreed, everytime I don't get my problems fixed in here I get it there. Or as a last resource really the Funtoo Forum.
2016-01-24 10:47:00	znac	great
2016-01-24 10:48:54	znac	competency :)
2016-01-24 10:49:22	znac	im very excited for my this first gentoo install
2016-01-24 10:49:27	znac	i take it you've used both?
2016-01-24 10:52:57	lambd0x	znac: Nops, before this OS I used Ubuntu and OpenBSD. But a friend of mine recommended Funtoo for he was using it a quite long time and it does have some BSD heritage.
2016-01-24 10:54:36	lambd0x	But as I learned, in fact Funtoo is a overlay of Gentoo and all Gentoo's packages Funtoo has and vice-versa. Daily Funtoo syncs from Gentoo somethings and so does Funtoo
2016-01-24 10:56:02	lambd0x	By the way... I installed Funtoo 6 days ago :)
2016-01-24 10:56:17	znac	interesting!
2016-01-24 10:56:46	znac	i really like OpenBSD and used it for some time
2016-01-24 10:56:51	znac	ubuntu is a different story :P
2016-01-24 10:57:40	znac	so yeah, from what i've gathered, funtoo is as you've described... seems interesting! couldn't decide which one to try first, so installing both in VMs :)
2016-01-24 10:58:04	znac	so what's the BSD heritage you've found? the init system?
2016-01-24 10:58:21	artois	the package manager is inspired by freebsd's
2016-01-24 10:59:15	lambd0x	znac: Exactly and the idea of maintaining everything in a tree repository and compiling everything from source.
2016-01-24 11:00:47	znac	artois: very nice. another quality system with a great package manager
2016-01-24 11:01:02	lambd0x	By the way... Funtoo is a evolved version of Gentoo, both were created by Daniel Robbins. But the younger of both is Funtoo.
2016-01-24 11:01:14	lambd0x	portage :)
2016-01-24 11:01:39	znac	i see.
2016-01-24 11:01:41	znac	yes
2016-01-24 11:02:32	lambd0x	yeah... when I first used linux 6 months ago apt-get for me was everything but then a professor suggested installing some BSD and portage really rocks way better.
2016-01-24 11:04:58	znac	haha apt... those were the days.
2016-01-24 11:05:18	lambd0x	znac: kkk. Did you start with it too?
2016-01-24 11:05:19	artois	prof of what?
2016-01-24 11:06:19	lambd0x	artois: Prof of Computer Networks :)

2016-01-24 12:33:32	dangergrrl	you know the guy who was my best friend in high school gets like $100/hr full time as a DBA and failed college algebra twice so i am not sure how important having a lot of math is for real work in IT
2016-01-24 12:33:43	dangergrrl	i mean perhaps if you are an academic
2016-01-24 12:34:44	artois	the piece of paper is the important part
2016-01-24 12:34:46	dangergrrl	he gets more than i ever did and i was doing unix internals specializing in fault tolerant and massively parallel systems
2016-01-24 12:34:56	artois	not how you got it, or what place you were in graduating
2016-01-24 12:35:13	artois	also more than any piece of paper, one's hustle is the most important
2016-01-24 12:35:23	artois	the more content you are at fleecing people, the better you'll do
2016-01-24 12:35:42	artois	being rich is not about being smart or useful
2016-01-24 12:35:45	dangergrrl	yes, the piece of paper is important i found out when i tried to get a full time job that i could not get hired to do the same job i was doing as a contractor because i have no masters degree
2016-01-24 12:35:49	artois	don't make that mistake =)
2016-01-24 12:36:07	artois	they do seem more important lately than even ten years ago
2016-01-24 12:36:13	artois	too many people, I guess
2016-01-24 12:36:28	artois	if someone with a degree applies to a job, even if the degree has nothing to do with the duties...
2016-01-24 12:36:38	dangergrrl	apparently research level work as a full time employee requires a masters or preferably a PhD
2016-01-24 12:36:43	artois	because people with degrees think degrees matter, you see, heh
2016-01-24 12:36:52	dangergrrl	if you are a contractor they only care if you can do the job
2016-01-24 12:37:06	artois	if you're a sane employer you only care if a person can do the job
2016-01-24 12:37:13	artois	that's the problem: folk aren't sane
2016-01-24 12:37:50	dangergrrl	i did research work at Tandem (before Compaq bought them)

2016-01-26 11:50:16	+_`_	media-video/mediainfo gives pretty good output
2016-01-26 11:51:02	+_`_	playback being slow could be a number of things

2016-01-26 11:54:07	+_`_	oh right ffprobe(1) gives the same output as `ffmpeg -i file`

2016-02-08 14:29:57	lambd0x	artois: But if I emerged it again, could I force vboxdrv to be loaded in /etc/conf.d/modules?
2016-02-08 14:30:42	artois	yes, it's just a module like any other
2016-02-08 14:30:49	artois	you either load it or you don't
2016-02-08 14:33:13	lambd0x	artois: Sorry for so much elementary questions about it. When it comes to kernel I prefer to know absolutely everything before doing anything that could be harmful to my system. Thanks for you help, friend.

2016-02-08 14:39:20	lambd0x	artois: When issuing 'emerge -1 @module-build' does it affects loaded modules to be rebuild too?
2016-02-08 14:40:58	artois	it's only external modules, IIRC
2016-02-08 14:41:05	artois	which are the only ones that are a problem
2016-02-08 14:41:07	artois	hence the solution
2016-02-08 14:41:22	artois	the only ones that come to mind in my decade's use of Gentoo are...
2016-02-08 14:41:29	artois	nvidia-drivers' module, vbox's, and vmware's
2016-02-08 14:41:38	artois	usually from proprietary packages like those
2016-02-08 14:44:33	lambd0x	artois: After loading vboxdrv would be good to issue this command then.
2016-02-08 14:44:56	artois	no
2016-02-08 14:45:05	artois	vboxdrv is required by virtualbox
2016-02-08 14:45:15	artois	and vboxdrv must be built against the current running kernel's current source
2016-02-08 14:45:17	artois	_so_
2016-02-08 14:45:21	artois	/if/ you update your kernel
2016-02-08 14:45:25	artois	you need to rebuild vboxdrv
2016-02-08 14:45:34	artois	which you can do, IIRC, with @module-rebuild
2016-02-08 14:45:48	artois	I don't think you even need -1, but that's easily tested
2016-02-08 14:46:54	lambd0x	artois: Ok, this command then is really everything to solve vbox problem.
2016-02-08 14:47:27	artois	it could solve _a_ vbox problem

I have to type it every time and it's a bit annoying. I read the gentoo wiki and actually my system reads the gpg-agent config file but I can't change the time.

2016-02-09 05:14:27	yann-kaelig	Ha! I found something lxqt-base/lxqt-meta Do not install x11-wm/openbox window manager.  I suppose I can install another WM with minimal like fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:17:00	@angry_vincent	something like that
2016-02-09 05:17:34	Juippis	you need an USE flag to get openbox
2016-02-09 05:17:47	@angry_vincent	lumina is using fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:17:55	@angry_vincent	close projects
2016-02-09 05:19:51	yann-kaelig	look like interesting project lumina. I will test it into VM. There are some interesting things, no consolekit/policykit... and other's things. Mmm perhaps it's not lxqt I need for my musical worstation but fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:23:08	yann-kaelig	I try -policykit into make.conf but a package need consolekit and want policykit
2016-02-09 05:23:20	yann-kaelig	for lxqt
2016-02-09 05:25:02	@angry_vincent	not sure if possible to use lxqt without it

2016-02-09 09:59:32	PaddyMac	floppym I've never known of it as anything besides thin-manifests, and the term "thin-manifests" goes back to 2010 according to Google. I was hoping to find some early mention of it which might also refer to some prior name, but I did not find anything. Why do you need to know?
2016-02-09 10:00:48	floppym	PaddyMac: So I can look smart in #gentoo-portage.

2016-02-09 15:35:50	PaddyMac	Despite warnings about upgrading to gcc 5.3.0, I've almost completed recompiling my entire system with gcc 5.3.0. Granted it's a minimalistic home server with only 720 packages installed, so I didn't expect any issues. But I think the gcc 5.3.0 threat has been a bit overstated.
2016-02-09 15:36:29	PaddyMac	Just 34 packages to go. 720 packages in about 3 days isn't too bad for this old clunker.
2016-02-09 15:39:02	@angry_vincent	floppym: yep, it was mini-manifest in the past
2016-02-09 15:44:58	PaddyMac	That's why I love IRC. Someone can say something, and someone can reply 3 hours later, and it's still a completely valid conversation.

2016-02-16 08:26:04	javaJake	Completely random question. Has anyone done a lot of concurrent development in C++?
2016-02-16 08:26:50	javaJake	I've been messing with ReactiveX in Java and have been deeply impressed with the practical application of otherwise-impractical functional principles.
2016-02-16 08:27:43	javaJake	However, it seems like that kind of development (passing immutable data down a pipeline of possibly asynchronous functions) is not really something C++ wants to even think about.

2016-02-16 23:08:24	lambd0x	Hi everyone!
2016-02-16 23:08:27	reisio	heyo
2016-02-16 23:09:55	lambd0x	reisio: do you know if 'boot-update' command cause the system to detect not only funtoo kernels, but also another OSs if you emerge first os-prober?
2016-02-16 23:11:17	reisio	'fraid not, I don't use boot-update
2016-02-16 23:11:21	reisio	my guess would be yes, though
2016-02-16 23:11:28	reisio	it probably just calls grub/2-mkconfig
2016-02-16 23:12:36	 < 	m0ltar (~moltar_ne@103.243.171.124) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2016-02-16 23:12:44	lambd0x	I'm in doubt about it. Cuz when I installed Funtoo I used 'grub2-mkconfig -o' ...

2016-02-16 23:14:12	lambd0x	Oh just reading the boot-update manpage... it says it creates a boot loader config based on /etc/boot.conf only
2016-02-16 23:15:04	lambd0x	reisio: :)
2016-02-16 23:16:03	lambd0x	reisio: I was just reading about kernel upgrades and this doubt came across me. Well good to know really
2016-02-16 23:16:25	lambd0x	reisio: Thanks for helping
2016-02-16 23:16:58	reisio	you can just check the grub.cfg afterwards
2016-02-16 23:19:21	lambd0x	reisio: Yeah, but the manpage of boot.config solved my doubt anyway
2016-02-16 23:19:35	lambd0x	*boot-update kk

2016-02-17 06:50:24	JDx	in the funtoo wiki (make.conf page) , it says users with SSD should consider moving portage temp dir to /tmp , in order to avoid the use of read/write operations on a SSD

2016-02-17 06:52:16	JDx	8 gigs

2016-02-17 06:52:56	@angry_vincent	set 6GB for example
2016-02-17 06:53:10	@angry_vincent	it maybe not enough for certain big pkgs

2016-02-17 13:04:06	Assuero	btw, some options that prevent userland to read /sys or /proc fs, could prevent hibernate... also some other options that prevend some manipulation of memory

2016-02-17 13:31:25	Assuero	no.. it's ok... the problem is that is not suspending or hibernating
2016-02-17 13:31:42	Assuero	is there no problem to lock the screen.. in fact i want it...
2016-02-17 13:31:43	trelane	drobbins, pong!
2016-02-17 13:32:17	Assuero	btw, i try to use hibernate/suspend conmmands also with root user, but evnet that not worked
2016-02-17 13:35:02	+_`_	are you trying to hibernate or suspend
2016-02-17 13:35:02		[13:35]
2016-02-17 13:35:12	+_`_	quite different
2016-02-17 13:35:30	Assuero	i tried both
2016-02-17 13:35:46	Assuero	firstly hibernate... not worked...
2016-02-17 13:35:58	Assuero	after i tried suspend... also not worked
2016-02-17 13:36:15	haxmeister	but what does it do exactly?
2016-02-17 13:36:19	+_`_	did you try manually printing the desired state to /sys/power/state ?
2016-02-17 13:36:39	+_`_	and if so did you check the ring buffer afterward?
2016-02-17 13:37:52	+_`_	https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt
2016-02-17 13:38:25	+_`_	grsec doesn't really impede on suspend, hibernate's another issue.

2016-02-17 13:55:46	Assuero	_`_, yes.. i tried..echo mem > /sys/power/state this command just blick the screen and back system normally
2016-02-17 13:56:31	Assuero	pm-hibernate also not worked..
2016-02-17 13:56:38	Assuero	i follow also this link: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Suspend_and_hibernate
2016-02-17 13:57:06	Assuero	i want any scenarious.. the best option is hibernate... but suspend to disk or ram, also is ok..
2016-02-17 13:58:05	+_`_	hibernate is to disk
2016-02-17 13:58:12	+_`_	suspend is to ram
2016-02-17 13:58:19	Assuero	focused on funtoo i only found it: http://www.funtoo.org/Power_Management
2016-02-17 13:58:39	Assuero	i know that.. i'm trying to setup any option
2016-02-17 13:59:16	+_`_	what do you mean it “blick the screen and back system”
2016-02-17 14:00:24	Assuero	the system "pretend" suspend... everything is black.. but few seconds after, everything back normal
2016-02-17 14:01:58	+_`_	and nothing in dmesg?

2016-02-17 20:02:35	Tassie_Tux	I am performing a fresh install for a virtual machine; currently chroot-ed and have just completed a world update
2016-02-17 20:03:51	Tassie_Tux	eselect-python updated
2016-02-17 20:04:43	Tassie_Tux	PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET is 3.4 however eselect python list indicates python2.7 - should I eselect python set python3.4?

2016-02-17 20:09:54	@angry_vincent	python2.7 is a default one in stages
2016-02-17 20:10:05	@angry_vincent	you can set 3.4 default if you want
2016-02-17 20:10:22	Tassie_Tux	I would prefer to set 3.4 :)
2016-02-17 20:11:30	Tassie_Tux	set
2016-02-17 20:11:44	Tassie_Tux	thanks
2016-02-17 20:12:18	wokko	Tassie_Tux: it probably is already your python3 default target 'eselect python list --python3'
2016-02-17 20:13:44	Tassie_Tux	wokko: so it is. I forget about that --python3 trick
2016-02-17 20:13:58	Tassie_Tux	wokko: ta
2016-02-17 20:17:17	wokko	Tassie_Tux: Just make sure that all your packages that require python can run with default 3_4 as I think some still rely on 2_7
2016-02-17 20:17:17		[20:17]
2016-02-17 20:19:12	@angry_vincent	Tassie_Tux: thx for kde pages updates
2016-02-17 20:19:24	@angry_vincent	ok, it seems glibc update is unavoidable
2016-02-17 20:20:12	Tassie_Tux	angry_vincent: happy to help. it is work in progress. I may be a bit awol over the next few weeks - moving house

2016-02-18 09:39:02	javaJake	For example, python2.7 --version, python3.3 --version
2016-02-18 09:39:16	zachron	javajake: they both report their correct version when run via 'python2.7 --version' and 'python3.3 --version'
2016-02-18 09:40:28	javaJake	Maybe the PYTHON_* configuration in make.conf is messing you up? What if you set PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" (instead of python3_4)?
2016-02-18 09:41:22	javaJake	Now I'm really curious because I got this exact issue on my Prefix but thought it was limited to Prefix environments.
2016-02-18 09:41:51	zachron	should i already have a PYTHON_TARGETS in make.conf? cause i dont
2016-02-18 09:42:21	javaJake	Well, hm. I'm just wondering if for some reason it expects python3.4 to be installed, because that's default now, but since it isn't, it fails.

2016-02-18 09:43:07	javaJake	So maybe instead of 'emerge -a1O portage' do 'emerge -1 portage' and let python3.4 install?
2016-02-18 09:43:11	javaJake	I'm assuming it's not.
2016-02-18 09:43:30	javaJake	So maybe instead of 'emerge -a1O portage' do 'emerge -1 portage' and let python3.4 install? <<< this is instead of setting PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" in make.conf
2016-02-18 09:45:13	zachron	when i do that it fails with this: http://pastebin.com/6EJ6yzS1
2016-02-18 09:46:12	javaJake	Oh, this is fun.
2016-02-18 09:46:30	javaJake	Try PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" and emerge -1 portage?
2016-02-18 09:47:11	javaJake	Then undo the PYTHON_TARGETS and let a @world update bump python appropriately to avoid the blockers in your previous paste?
2016-02-18 09:48:04	zachron	that worked for getting portage updated
2016-02-18 09:48:22	javaJake	OK, so now undo the PYTHON_* config and let portage update @world?
2016-02-18 09:48:36	javaJake	Maybe 2.4.1 does provide EAPI 6.
2016-02-18 09:50:24	zachron	javajake: yeah that appears to have resolved my issue. thanks!

2016-02-18 09:50:29	javaJake	No problem
2016-02-18 09:51:40	javaJake	angry_vincent: there appears to be a bug in python_* ebuild functions which assume PYTHON_TARGETS=... also represents a usable Python installation. I bet anyone who hasn't updated to portage 2.4.1 before the PYTHON_TARGETS bump will have to go through that ^^^

2016-02-19 06:05:14	reisio	Uniaika: Funtoo's tree out of sync with Gentoo's again
2016-02-19 06:05:24	reisio	this is a really, really, really common problem
2016-02-19 06:05:38	reisio	I don't really understand why it endures, it should be easily fixed
2016-02-19 06:06:17	javaJake	Certain packages are sharded if they're known to cause issues during updates.
2016-02-19 06:06:32	@angry_vincent	ruby2.3 and all that sutff is masked in Funtoo
2016-02-19 06:06:32	reisio	Uniaika: temporary solution would be to take Gentoo's eselect-ruby-20151229 and put it in an overlay, or put off using that version of whatever package needs the newer eselect-ruby
2016-02-19 06:06:33	javaJake	But that also means updates are missed and cause missed dependencies like this
2016-02-19 06:06:46	reisio	yeah, you should also mask things that dep on them, in that case
2016-02-19 06:07:18	Uniaika	;_;
2016-02-19 06:07:21	Uniaika	damnit
2016-02-19 06:07:29	reisio	that's how I would feel if I were you :p
2016-02-19 06:08:20	reisio	it doesn't really help to "protect" users from something you consider unstable by making other things further unstable by not properly masking/removing things that have completely unavailable deps
2016-02-19 06:08:38	@angry_vincent	obviously
2016-02-19 06:08:46	reisio	well I would have thought so :)

2016-02-19 06:24:30	sandro_	However there is a group in facebook called "Amici di Funtoo" (in italian) .... and i've posted 4 videos with recordmydesktop to make an example about the Funtoo installation and configuration :)

2016-02-19 06:27:43	@angry_vincent	what was the problem then? bad kernel config?
2016-02-19 06:31:12	sandro_	angry_vincent:i've make various experiment either with "Stable" than "Current" and i've not encountered trouble with genkernel :)

2016-02-19 06:31:56	sandro_	but if you want tell me ...... if i can make an experiment thath may be util to test genkernel :)
2016-02-19 06:33:04	sandro_	angry_vincent: may be that the trouble was related to a "bad config file" ......

2016-02-19 14:54:24	splash_wave	yeah lol
2016-02-19 14:54:59	splash_wave	anyone?
2016-02-19 14:55:16	PaddyMac	No, but if you have an answer for my question, I can at least make up an answer for yours.
2016-02-19 14:55:43	splash_wave	whats your question?
2016-02-19 14:56:43	PaddyMac	How can I make text files originating from a DOS environment with high ASCII character display correctly?
2016-02-19 14:57:09	PaddyMac	A lot of the high ASCII characters display as circles with question marks in them.
2016-02-19 14:58:07	splash_wave	whats "high ASCII"
2016-02-19 14:58:35	PaddyMac	charcters 128-255 (I think) in the ASCII character set.
2016-02-19 14:59:19	PaddyMac	low ASCII is 0-127
2016-02-19 14:59:21	splash_wave	what program are you opening the text files in?
2016-02-19 14:59:58	PaddyMac	Usually nano, but I've tried vi, cat, more, and other such utilities for displaying text. All with the same result.
2016-02-19 15:00:15	splash_wave	so what are your text files for?
2016-02-19 15:00:24	PaddyMac	I found a few discussions on the 'net about the issue but no real answers.
2016-02-19 15:01:00	PaddyMac	generally they are text files included with old DOS software.

2016-02-19 15:01:49	PaddyMac	I'm wondering if maybe there is some eselect fontconfig setting or something that might help.
2016-02-19 15:02:44	splash_wave	i would try opening them in notepad or worded on a windows machine
2016-02-19 15:02:44		[15:02]
2016-02-19 15:02:56	splash_wave	there might be more character and font support
2016-02-19 15:03:07	PaddyMac	Like maybe is there a way to force using a specific font when displaying certain kinds of files? Like the terminus font, for example? Or maybe dejavu-sans-mono.
2016-02-19 15:03:39	PaddyMac	Hmmm.... I wonder if Wine's notepad would display them correctly...
2016-02-19 15:03:55	splash_wave	yeah
2016-02-19 15:04:04	splash_wave	so u run what distro?
2016-02-19 15:04:05	PaddyMac	I'm pretty sure they would display correctly under Windows XP.
2016-02-19 15:04:13	splash_wave	yeah windows xp might
2016-02-19 15:04:14	PaddyMac	I'm running Funtoo.
2016-02-19 15:04:53	PaddyMac	Rebooting into XP is inconvenient, but perhaps it could help out if I really need to see something the right way.
2016-02-19 15:05:49	PaddyMac	Since ASCII and ANSI stuff is so old-school, there isn't much modern software that handles it correctly.
2016-02-19 15:06:30	PaddyMac	We're talking stuff that went out of vogue 15-20 years ago.
2016-02-19 15:06:59	PaddyMac	Is there a way to force programs to use a specific font?
2016-02-19 15:07:05	 < 	michaelrose (~michael@71-212-33-3.tukw.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-19 15:07:38	reisio	like which programs?
2016-02-19 15:08:12	splash_wave	are you running a desktop gui?
2016-02-19 15:09:31	PaddyMac	Well, I'm running KDE 4 on my main desktop, and I'm running another box headless, but I can VNC or x2go into it with LXDE.
2016-02-19 15:10:02	PaddyMac	reisio: Like nano, for example.
2016-02-19 15:10:18	PaddyMac	reisio: Or maybe putty
2016-02-19 15:11:20	splash_wave	what about opening them in open office
2016-02-19 15:11:21	reisio	putty yes, it has its own config
2016-02-19 15:11:28	reisio	nano is a terminal app, it might not
2016-02-19 15:11:35	reisio	you might have to rely on the terminal's config
2016-02-19 15:12:23	PaddyMac	How would I use putty to use a specific font?
2016-02-19 15:13:25	splash_wave	putty is SSH... why would we even consider using that? aren't we supposed to open text files in text editors or word process programs?
2016-02-19 15:15:02	 > 	michaelrose (~michael@71-212-33-3.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #funtoo
2016-02-19 15:16:12	reisio	that argument is going to be lost on a putty user
2016-02-19 15:16:19	reisio	PaddyMac: it has it in prefs
2016-02-19 15:20:38	splash_wave	so does anyone have an answer to setting a password on a fat32 external drive?

2016-02-19 15:23:45	PaddyMac	reisio: The Debian putty isn't giving me any options. But I ssh'd with X11-forwarding into my headless server (which is Funtoo), and puttytel does give me options. One of the options is to use ISO-8859-1 as the character set. That *should* cause things to display correctly.
2016-02-19 15:24:28	reisio	splash_wave: what for
2016-02-19 15:24:51	reisio	the unix port of putty has the same GUI prefs AFAIK
2016-02-19 15:26:13	PaddyMac	Well, I want to use Putty to access an ANSI BBS over telnet.
2016-02-19 15:26:30	PaddyMac	ISO-8859-1 maybe isn't what I need after all... I may have to try different encodings.

2016-02-19 15:29:15	splash_wave	nvm
2016-02-19 15:29:37	splash_wave	my friend who has this drive that wants a password is exchanging his disk for another
2016-02-19 15:30:03	reisio	mmmkay
2016-02-19 15:32:11	PaddyMac	Yeah. I may just have to tinker with this a bit. Apparently the Debian and Funtoo implementations of PuTTY are different.
2016-02-19 15:32:40	PaddyMac	I may just end up doing what a friend did and run Telix or Telemate under DOSBox.

2016-02-19 15:41:00	splash_wave	gui**
2016-02-19 15:42:36	reisio	Xfce mostly, been meaning to switch to a tiling wm for years
2016-02-19 15:42:40	reisio	r-e-i-TAB
2016-02-19 15:43:09	splash_wave	do u ever read or hack the x11 source?
2016-02-19 15:43:50	reisio	incredibly rarely I have looked at xlib stuff
2016-02-19 15:45:08	splash_wave	i know xlib is of course a library.. but what functions does it offer?

2016-02-19 15:48:52	splash_wave	gui

2016-02-19 15:59:52	splash_wave	so meaning i shouldn't dive into xlib or x11 source?
2016-02-19 16:02:19	reisio	yes, you can make a GUI with xlib alone
2016-02-19 16:02:28	reisio	fontforge uses it, IIRC
2016-02-19 16:02:31	reisio	xfontsel
2016-02-19 16:02:38	reisio	that one X calc program
2016-02-19 16:02:48	reisio	it's pretty rudimentary on its own
2016-02-19 16:03:16	reisio	if you want to get into GUI stuff, for the masses, anyway, you should probably look at GTK+ or Qt, or whatever wayland is getting into, if it differs largely from xlib
2016-02-19 16:03:28	reisio	as wayland will replace X soon enough

2016-02-20 04:32:03	blaise	I'm really curious as to why?
2016-02-20 04:32:25	blaise	also, when will be we getting kcm-touchpad-frameworks

2016-02-20 04:32:53	@angry_vincent	what's that

2016-02-20 04:34:23	blaise	well, we had 5.5.4 and then it went missing
2016-02-20 04:34:43	blaise	kensington: so the touchpad useflag for plasma-desktop?
2016-02-20 04:34:48	kensington	yes
2016-02-20 04:35:23	blaise	kensington: thank you, I had completely missed that
2016-02-20 04:36:26	@angry_vincent	do you have more info about regression?
2016-02-20 04:36:56	@angry_vincent	it could be resolved by updates
2016-02-20 04:38:46	blaise	angry_vincent: version 5.5.4 isn't visiable in portage nore do I see the ebuilds
2016-02-20 04:39:11	blaise	I currently have them installed, as I've not commited the regression

2016-02-20 04:40:42	blaise	I'm not inquiring about a bug.. I had updated to plasma-meta-4.4.5 and about 3 to 7 days ago the ebuilds went missing from the tree
2016-02-20 04:41:08	blaise	angry_vincent: do you have a plasma-meta-4.4.5.ebuild ?
2016-02-20 04:41:55	blaise	plasma-meta-5.5.49 is current upstream I think

2016-02-20 04:42:35	blaise	portage is wanting to fall back to plasma-meta-5.4.3 since that is the latest version remaining in the tree
2016-02-20 04:42:47	@angry_vincent	i'm not sure i getting the problem
2016-02-20 04:43:26	@angry_vincent	portage output probably could enlighten this

2016-02-20 06:38:28	Zedax	hey do you know when trying to build icedtea it also tries to merge icedtea-bin? i don't want the binary but build it from scratch.,.
2016-02-20 06:38:54	@angry_vincent	yes, its needed
2016-02-20 06:39:28	Zedax	dev-java/icedtea-7.2.6.3-r4:7::gentoo   won't build the source?
2016-02-20 06:39:58	Zedax	angry_vincent, do you mean that it's needed to build it?
2016-02-20 06:39:59	@angry_vincent	to build icedtea form source, you need a gcj (a gcc's java) or other already compiled java (like icedtea-bin)
2016-02-20 06:40:04	@angry_vincent	right
2016-02-20 06:40:11	Zedax	alright
2016-02-20 06:40:24	@angry_vincent	you can remove icedtea-bin after

2016-02-20 07:02:15	quiznilo	Zedax_: 2 things about that though, first, I set it going in the background, and can do my work and not have my computer lock up on me
2016-02-20 07:02:29	quiznilo	or if I have it going overnight, who cares if it takes 4 hours instead of 1
2016-02-20 07:03:09	Zedax_	in that case :), but libreoffice or other on just one core.. is going to be painful xD
2016-02-20 07:03:09	quiznilo	secondly, yeah, it takes longer, but I was getting some build errors with MAKEOPTS > 1
2016-02-20 07:03:26	quiznilo	nah, not painful, just have it going in the background

2016-02-20 08:51:49	blaise	quiznilo: I ran cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log |grep font and got this.. https://bpaste.net/show/a6809d28582f
2016-02-20 08:51:55	blaise	quiznilo: could that have something to do with it?
2016-02-20 08:52:04	michaelrose	so there is a regression in the newest version of compton
2016-02-20 08:52:12	quiznilo	no
2016-02-20 08:52:15	quiznilo	I get that too

2016-02-20 08:52:36	quiznilo	I don't think your dm has anything to do with xorg
2016-02-20 08:52:44	quiznilo	xorg is not running when the dm is
2016-02-20 08:53:23	michaelrose	with the newest version of compton in portage + nvidia drivers + mpv built with vdpau doing other things while mpv is playing causes mpv to stutter
2016-02-20 08:53:36	michaelrose	easiest example is deleting and opening tabs in firefox
2016-02-20 08:54:40	michaelrose	I tried several combinations of settings most recent and prior version of nvidia drivers and the 2 most recent versions of mpv + 9999 version
2016-02-20 08:55:15	blaise	I rebuilt qtcore and am rebuilding qtgui now
2016-02-20 08:55:23	blaise	those are deps of sddm...
2016-02-20 08:55:34	blaise	freefont is a dep of qt though
2016-02-20 08:55:37	blaise	so.......
2016-02-20 08:55:44	blaise	maybe I need to rebuild that as well
2016-02-20 08:55:51	michaelrose	essentially went through all the permutations of 3 different mpv versions 2 different nvidia-drivers, with and without compton and with and without vdpau
2016-02-20 08:56:13	michaelrose	before discovering that a recent update of compton is to blame
2016-02-20 08:57:28	michaelrose	essentially the issue only obtains if you update compton to 0.1._beta2, have compton running, and run mpv with vdpau enabled
2016-02-20 08:58:31	blaise	or, freetype I mean
2016-02-20 08:58:31		[08:58]
2016-02-20 09:01:53	blaise	michaelrose: didn't mpv go stale?
2016-02-20 09:02:37	blaise	wow, guess not

2016-02-20 09:22:20	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: which number ?
2016-02-20 09:22:29	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: is this your processor ? http://ark.intel.com/it/products/49020/Intel-Core-i3-370M-Processor-3M-cache-2_40-GHz
2016-02-20 09:22:47	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: yes it is
2016-02-20 09:23:18	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: I read on wikipedia that it's un Arrandale family
2016-02-20 09:23:28	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: excuse me .... i'm searching for "nearest technology"

2016-02-20 09:24:11	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: ok, thank you very much
2016-02-20 09:24:37	sandro_	I think thath may be a Sandy-bridge based processor

2016-02-20 09:26:14	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: mine is the 3rd of the 1st list
2016-02-20 09:26:57	 > 	hawkandbaby (~hawkandba@68.71.19.150) has joined #funtoo
2016-02-20 09:26:58	sandro_	no ... it is not a Sandy bridge cause doesn't support AVX instructions then first core "i*" cpu i think
2016-02-20 09:28:01	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: I read that sandybridge is the 2nd edition of the i3 for laptop
2016-02-20 09:28:17	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: and Arrandale are the 1st edition
2016-02-20 09:28:40	sandro_	Saandy-bridge is 2nd generation for i3, i5 and i7  (and Xeon) processors
2016-02-20 09:29:20	sandro_	try this
2016-02-20 09:29:20		[09:29]
2016-02-20 09:29:29	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: yes. The 1st generation for i3 are nehalem... but i don't know if it's that...
2016-02-20 09:29:44	sandro_	grep pclmul /proc/cpuinfo
2016-02-20 09:30:14	sandro_	Use the stage3 for first generation .....
2016-02-20 09:30:50	sandro_	but you'll can use *FLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe" ....
2016-02-20 09:31:12	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: for the moment I've got generic_64 tarball
2016-02-20 09:31:27	sandro_	Ok ....
2016-02-20 09:31:31	TheSuperGeek	what do the command grep pclmul should do ?
2016-02-20 09:32:33	sandro_	with generic you (if you want) make an emerge -e world after declaring epro subarch native_64
2016-02-20 09:32:49	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: okay
2016-02-20 09:33:02	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: thank you very much for your help !
2016-02-20 09:33:18	sandro_	I post my make.conf ... take a look about *FLAGS ... just a moment ....
2016-02-20 09:34:17	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: http://pastebin.com/U8cZ0Kg6
2016-02-20 09:34:49	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: ok
2016-02-20 09:34:51	sandro_	and in forums.funtoo.org there is a discussion about make.conf configuration :)
2016-02-20 09:35:27	sandro_	I love the -march=native ... so gcc can read all instructions for your processor :)
2016-02-20 09:35:39	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: cool
2016-02-20 09:35:53	sandro_	cause also one processor family , changing stepping may have differencies :)
2016-02-20 09:36:41	TheSuperGeek	but what is native ?
2016-02-20 09:36:57	TheSuperGeek	because I don't see it on subarchs page
2016-02-20 09:37:34	sandro_	no ... native must be declared after first installation of stage3 :)
2016-02-20 09:37:40	TheSuperGeek	ok
2016-02-20 09:38:22	sandro_	I make an example: about -march=core2, there are 2 steppings :)
2016-02-20 09:39:02	sandro_	if you declared -march=core2, you will have not the sse4.2 cause implemented in "Penryn" processors :)
2016-02-20 09:39:29	TheSuperGeek	ok
2016-02-20 09:40:00	TheSuperGeek	thank you for all sandro_ ! and good night (if it's night in your country ;) )
2016-02-20 09:40:09	sandro_	more than 2 steppings in core2 ...... but 2 different processors (changing also technology from 65 nm to 45 nm) ....
2016-02-20 09:40:34	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: i'm in Italy :) 23:40 :)
2016-02-20 09:40:51	sandro_	Ah also for the kernel you can optimize .....
2016-02-20 09:41:12	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: i'm in france and it's the same hour :P
2016-02-20 09:41:21	sandro_	for the firs time may be you'll choice the "included" debian-sources.
2016-02-20 09:41:34	sandro_	but if you want to create a custom kernel:

2016-02-21 10:52:51	PaddyMac	reisio: Portage is plenty fast until you start adding overlays.
2016-02-21 10:54:05	PaddyMac	Even adding just a couple of overlays can make a very noticeable difference, and adding a lot of overlays can make a difference of a few seconds calculation going up to half an hour calculation.
2016-02-21 10:55:09	reisio	I only ever have a single small local overlay at most
2016-02-21 10:55:19	reisio	I do have kinda old hardware, though
2016-02-21 10:55:27	reisio	probably wouldn't notice with a newer box/more ram/ssd, etc.
2016-02-21 10:55:42	PaddyMac	There wouldn't be so many overlays if it weren't such a slow process getting new ebuilds into the main tree.
2016-02-21 10:56:21	PaddyMac	There are a lot of talented ebuild writers who just say f*** it and make their own overlay.
2016-02-21 11:00:31	reisio	yeah, that I believe
2016-02-21 11:00:31		[11:00]
2016-02-21 11:00:48	reisio	luckily portage is wonderful enough to make that an easy choice, though
2016-02-21 11:01:27	reisio	so, I don't think that's my problem at all, but, to continue this conversation
2016-02-21 11:01:37	reisio	couldn't you store overlay ebuilds/files in /usr/portage/ and that'd speed it all up?
2016-02-21 11:01:44	reisio	and use postsync to maintain it?

2016-02-21 11:21:58	darlinger	hello anyone :) dropping in to say hi from NJ
2016-02-21 11:22:08	reisio	ohio
2016-02-21 11:22:27	 < 	proteusguy_satri (~proteusgu@183.88.73.82) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2016-02-21 11:24:39	darlinger	is that your way of saying hello or your state ;)
2016-02-21 11:24:40	PaddyMac	I don't know how overlays are handled internally by Portage, but it seems to me that the fastest way to handle overlays would be if Portage saw the main tree and all overlays together as a single, virtual tree.
2016-02-21 11:25:10	darlinger	PaddyMac: what happens when you have ebuild collisions?
2016-02-21 11:25:16	darlinger	it's called "overlay" for a reason
2016-02-21 11:25:31	darlinger	also some overlays use subversion -_-
2016-02-21 11:25:55	PaddyMac	By collision, do you mean two ebuilds that have the exact same name?
2016-02-21 11:26:18	darlinger	yes
2016-02-21 11:26:45	PaddyMac	There is already a sort of hierarchy in place that determines which one takes precedence.
2016-02-21 11:28:18	PaddyMac	I'm no expert, but if that can be handled now, I don't see why it couldn't be handled in a "virtual-tree" scenario.
2016-02-21 11:28:39	+_`_	taking precedence is asymmetric from your hypothetical solution
2016-02-21 11:28:44	PaddyMac	Implement some reasonable defaults that can be overridden by commandline switches.
2016-02-21 11:30:29	PaddyMac	Maybe a virtual tree could be created prior to runtime and updated whenever the Portage tree or overlays are updated.
2016-02-21 11:30:51	+_`_	I don't like that idea
2016-02-21 11:30:57	+_`_	at all
2016-02-21 11:32:14	reisio	well, if you only have things you actually want/require in your overlay
2016-02-21 11:32:27	reisio	there's really no harm overwriting normal portage tree versions
2016-02-21 11:32:30	+_`_	sounds like said virtual tree would have to consist of an atom from either the main repository OR another one.
2016-02-21 11:32:34	reisio	except that a sync would over-overwrite them
2016-02-21 11:32:36	reisio	hence postsync
2016-02-21 11:33:00	reisio	there are FSes for merging two separate FSes, though, of course
2016-02-21 11:33:00		[11:33]
2016-02-21 11:33:02	+_`_	and to change whatever is used for an atom, I'd have to regenerate the virtual tree each time
2016-02-21 11:33:14	+_`_	even union mounts don't really help here imo.

2016-02-21 11:34:57	reisio	well it'd help for having a union mount, which is what he was suggesting, AIUI
2016-02-21 11:37:34	PaddyMac	Well, I didn't have in mind a unionfs-type solution -- not an actual one, anyway. Just some sort of virtual union of all the overlays and main tree together that Portage sees. Because it seems that would speed up dependency calculations in a scenario where lots of overlays were used.
2016-02-21 11:38:58	reisio	I imagine in that event, the overhead of the unionfs might negate the benefits
2016-02-21 11:39:01	reisio	but not necessarily
2016-02-21 11:39:13	PaddyMac	But I wonder... Just for the experimenting... "for science", as they say.... what would happen if someone tried a union approach on their filesystem without altering Portage just to see what would happen.
2016-02-21 11:39:47	+_`_	overlayfs isn't really suitable for this, aufs isn't something every one's going to want to patch in/default to, and whatever halfbaked fuse unionfs implementations are still fuse. And it'd still be annoying for interchanging which repository's atom is what's being used.

2016-02-21 11:42:45	reisio	without altering portage would be the ideal way IMO
2016-02-21 11:42:49	reisio	outside of altering portage
2016-02-21 11:44:38	PaddyMac	I wonder if Poudriere or Synth could be a source of inspiration for improvements to Portage.

2016-02-21 11:47:00	+_`_	poudriere's functionality should have been part of the ports system to begin with in a much similar fashion

2016-02-21 11:51:09	reisio	inspiration from the unspellable
2016-02-21 11:51:09		[11:51]
2016-02-21 11:51:59	PaddyMac	After a short experiment with FreeBSD, the speed of the system was the main thing I liked But I think that was due to maybe a lack of any extensive prechecking or calculation of any kind. It's like it just started and hoped everything worked correctly.
2016-02-21 11:52:28	PaddyMac	Referring to the ports system....
2016-02-21 11:55:04	Arfrever	darlinger, PaddyMac: The reason for word "overlay" disappeared in year 2009.
2016-02-21 11:55:27	reisio	why's that?
2016-02-21 11:56:14	Arfrever	reisio: Question for me?
2016-02-21 11:56:44	reisio	yes
2016-02-21 11:56:46	PaddyMac	Seems like I vaguely remember reading something recently about a change in preferred nomenclature for overlays, but I don't recall the details.
2016-02-21 11:57:17	+_`_	manual refers to them as repositories usually
2016-02-21 11:57:30	Arfrever	Word "overlay" is from times when eclasses from repositories later in [PORTDIR]+PORTDIR_OVERLAY were overlaying eclasses from earlier repositories.
2016-02-21 11:57:50	reisio	PORTDIR_OVERLAY?
2016-02-21 11:57:59	reisio	that's in the man still
2016-02-21 11:58:07	reisio	eh, okay
2016-02-21 11:58:10	Arfrever	Word "overlay" is incorrect since introduction of masters settings in repositories.
2016-02-21 11:58:14	reisio	I thought you meant it actually had its reasoning disappear
2016-02-21 11:58:15	+_`_	that variable has been long since deprecated
2016-02-21 11:58:19	reisio	and not that it was replaced with another word
2016-02-21 11:58:21	Arfrever	PORTDIR/PORTDIR_OVERLAY variables are deprecated.
2016-02-21 11:58:33	reisio	thank goodness deprecated isn't obsoleted :D
2016-02-21 11:58:56	Arfrever	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/portage.git/commit/?id=2bd2620142d15344f32ef67896c4fa88e5386953
2016-02-21 11:59:16	PaddyMac	Well, whether they're called overlays or repositories, that doesn't change the fact that using them slows down Portage's dependency calculations.
2016-02-21 11:59:27	reisio	I see what you're saying, and I don't take any issue with it, but you just can't unname something, it isn't possible
2016-02-21 11:59:32	Arfrever	PaddyMac: Only if missing cache.
2016-02-21 11:59:40	reisio	all you do is make multiple names for something that once had only one :D
2016-02-21 12:00:10	Arfrever	If a name is no longer correct, then it should not be used.
2016-02-21 12:00:47	+_`_	unfortunately if ubiquity already hit in, it's tough
2016-02-21 12:00:57	+_`_	just gotta hope people adapt
2016-02-21 12:01:01	PaddyMac	Arfrever: Then an awful lot of overlays must be missing metadata caches. But I really don't think that's the only factor. I've had multiple overlays installed and generated my own local metadata cache, and it still is slow as Christmas when lot of overlays are installed.

2016-02-22 10:29:43	masonhauk	whats up funtoo
2016-02-22 10:30:08	masonhauk	im looking to make a funtoo/gentoo live usb install
2016-02-22 10:30:13	masonhauk	any ideas
2016-02-22 10:30:32	chry	Whatcha mean by that?
2016-02-22 10:30:59	chry	You need a live usb distro for *too install, or you wanna make one? ;3
2016-02-22 10:32:27	masonhauk	well, I want to have funtoo or gentoo installed on a usb like a dual boot just only the usb drive holds the os, making any chnges while uptime down time next boot changes from previous are still kept
2016-02-22 10:33:01	masonhauk	meaning ive tried installing gentoo livedvd to usb from unetbooten etc rufis sysrescd and all changes are discarded
2016-02-22 10:33:09	masonhauk	only temp runs exist
2016-02-22 10:33:46	masonhauk	to be honest id prefer funtoo...
2016-02-22 10:34:25	masonhauk	but if i cant get the kernel right because this is a new lenovo ideapad 100 laptop
2016-02-22 10:34:38	masonhauk	without papi kernel seeds makes things hard
2016-02-22 10:36:48	chry	Well, here's a sort of an idea: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LiveDVD-Persistence-Mode
2016-02-22 10:38:10	masonhauk	hmm
2016-02-22 10:38:23	masonhauk	ok so I wouldnt need to partition the drive like the guide
2016-02-22 10:41:23	michaelrose	generally you do the entire install in a single session and this often is a short one at that

2016-02-22 14:36:16	forumirc|65415	thanks chry I'll try that, really hope this works :(
2016-02-22 14:37:52	chry	Me too. ;p

2016-02-22 14:59:35	forumirc|65415	ah what the hell, it says dependencies could not be completely resolved due to the following required packages not being installed: >=sys-boot/grub-2.00-r5 pulled in by sys-boot/boot-update

2016-02-22 15:05:16	forumirc|65415	sda or sda1? sda1 is the boot partition
2016-02-22 15:07:16	reisio	grub is installed usually to the device, not the partition

2016-02-24 07:24:13	stakewinner00	if i don't want postfix, how can i remove it and avoid it to be installed when doing emerge -auvDN @world?
2016-02-24 07:30:00		[07:24]
2016-02-24 07:33:14	javaJake	stakewinner00: do you have it installed?
2016-02-24 07:33:24	stakewinner00	yes
2016-02-24 07:33:36	javaJake	stakewinner00: emerge --depclean -v postfix # tells you who pulls it
2016-02-24 07:33:53	stakewinner00	but when i do emerge -auvDN @world it try to install postfix again
2016-02-24 07:34:15	javaJake	If it's a new package you can use --tree to see who pulls what in your emerge @world
2016-02-24 07:34:29	javaJake	On my install:
2016-02-24 07:34:33	javaJake	  mail-mta/postfix-3.0.1-r1 pulled in by:
2016-02-24 07:34:34	javaJake	    virtual/mta-1 requires mail-mta/postfix
2016-02-24 07:35:45	 < 	michaelrose (~michael@174-31-161-24.tukw.qwest.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-02-24 07:36:25	javaJake	stakewinner00: virtual/mta, for example, is pulled by sudo when USE="sendmail" is set (and it is by default)
2016-02-24 07:36:51	javaJake	I found that by doing 'emerge --depclean -pv virtual/mta'
2016-02-24 07:37:08	javaJake	And then reading the ebuild to see where it is in the *DEPEND variables

2016-02-24 07:39:00	javaJake	I have fcron installed and it has: mta? ( virtual/mta ) which means when USE="mta" (and it is by default per the ebuild's IUSE=".... +mta ....") then it needs virtual/mta

2016-02-24 07:41:13	stakewinner00	mmm i think i have not sendmail in USE flag.
2016-02-24 07:41:40	javaJake	It's set by default in sudo's ebuild, so you have to explicitly turn it off
2016-02-24 07:41:47	javaJake	Same with mta
2016-02-24 07:41:51	stakewinner00	oh, ok. thanks
2016-02-24 07:42:23	gromez	hi, is there a reason why englightenment-0.20.5 from official gentoo portage tree has not been merge in funtoo tree? or just have to wait few days?
2016-02-24 07:43:47	javaJake	stakewinner00: if you mask postfix, that's a way of forcing portage to not consider it, and that will cause portage to throw dependency stacks you can follow when something depends on it.
2016-02-24 07:44:10	javaJake	I did that with kdelibs to have a Plasma 5 pure system for a long time.

2016-02-24 10:51:45	reisio	lxde isn't more than openbox & utils enough for me to like it, really

2016-02-24 10:51:53	*	reisio shrugs
2016-02-24 10:52:02	reisio	I s'pose I should give it a brief look
2016-02-24 10:52:16	reisio	I'm guessing lxde hasn't any real opposition to GNOME/dconf madness, either
2016-02-24 10:52:33	reisio	I had assumed, all these years, that Xfce had one, even if informally
2016-02-24 10:52:36	reisio	but that is apparently not the case
2016-02-24 10:52:52	reisio	I just don't see who their target user base is if they require that many GNOME deps
2016-02-24 10:53:04	reisio	seems like Xfce was always the version of GNOME without the awful GNOME deps...
2016-02-24 10:53:18	reisio	Digit: Lisp, also not really my thing :)
2016-02-24 10:53:33	reisio	but if it was, common lisp would be the one I would aim at, obviously
2016-02-24 10:54:22	haxmeister	Steel Bank Common Lisp... best one prolly
2016-02-24 10:54:30	haxmeister	unless you like JVM
2016-02-24 10:55:32	reisio	steel bank, that sounds like a windowsy thing
2016-02-24 10:55:43	reisio	anyway, lisp isn't really my thing, common or not :D
2016-02-24 10:55:48	reisio	don't care for the syntax
2016-02-24 10:56:19	haxmeister	the scheme subset is more interesting.. but yeah the syntax and all the ()() turn a lot of peeps off
2016-02-24 10:56:28	reisio	yeah, scheme is interesting
2016-02-24 10:56:30	reisio	and so is lisp, really
2016-02-24 10:56:34	reisio	but I don't care for the syntax
2016-02-24 10:56:46	haxmeister	( . Y . )

2016-02-24 11:22:00	sandro_	but not under Funtoo :(
2016-02-24 11:22:20	haxmeister	I think a mouse maze would be fun to do.. with arduino controlling doors/buttons etc..
2016-02-24 11:22:24	sandro_	i'm trying to stalk those friends with Funtoo :D :D :D
2016-02-24 11:22:55	sandro_	I must learn more about Arduino ....
2016-02-24 11:23:10	sandro_	excuse me haxmeister ....
2016-02-24 11:23:27	sandro_	but 1 thing at once .... step by step :)

2016-02-24 11:24:21	sandro_	these night (for me 01:24 am) i'm very happy about new nvidia-drivers that have solved a (for me) critical situation.
2016-02-24 11:24:50	sandro_	If you have questions about Arduino i can tell to my friends (but they uses Fedora .... :|)

2016-02-24 11:34:40	xemacs	shamus397, commonlisp has alien
2016-02-24 11:34:53	shamus397	alien?
2016-02-24 11:35:05	xemacs	that all i know sorry
2016-02-24 11:35:10	shamus397	:-)
2016-02-24 11:35:37	xemacs	but i think it is what you may be looking for
2016-02-24 11:36:01	shamus397	there isn't even an easy way to get stuff back that you typed into the top level loop :-P
2016-02-24 11:36:01		[11:36]
2016-02-24 11:36:12	xemacs	cmucl is faster then other commonlisp implementations

2016-02-24 11:38:27	shamus397	hmm, a quick google search for 'lisp alien gui' turns up nothing. typical :-P
2016-02-24 11:39:50	xemacs	it is part of the language
2016-02-24 11:40:13	xemacs	or the specification of it is
2016-02-24 11:40:29	shamus397	oh, the abandoned stuff then
2016-02-24 11:40:43	reisio	try 'lisp asplien ghuiiiisppplt'
2016-02-24 11:41:18	Digit	mmmm haskell.  whole classes of problems just disapear.  n if one learns haskell as their first language, they need never experience a day of stress from unwanted dirty side effects.  :)
2016-02-24 11:41:38	shamus397	i've that about lisp, too :-P
2016-02-24 11:41:41	shamus397	*heard
2016-02-24 11:41:51	Digit	hehe, lisps have /some/ of that, yeah.
2016-02-24 11:43:13	reisio	Digit: don't say that, you might make me interested in it :p
2016-02-24 11:44:21	xemacs	i have googled "alien data common lisp" found it i think
2016-02-24 11:44:40	Digit	danger danger!   we're already past the point of no return.  the interest seed has been planted.  now it's only a matter of time... will you water it slow, or fast.  ;)
2016-02-24 11:44:48	xemacs	shamus397,  i have googled "alien data common lisp" found it i think
2016-02-24 11:47:34	shamus397	interesting, but nothing to do with gui programming :-)
2016-02-24 11:48:28	Digit	reisio: you might still manage to put it off for the rest of your life... ;) so long as you didnt start: mpv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLj1QV11o9g

2016-02-24 11:54:43	reisio	the real problem with this is that I was liking Xfce for a bridge between what I need and what people I build installs for are used to
2016-02-24 11:54:45	haxmeister	reisio, I am a CNC machinist so I program and operate a CNC mill daily.
2016-02-24 11:55:02	reisio	haxmeister: oh sweet
2016-02-24 11:55:13	reisio	so you could mill something from a 3d model for me?
2016-02-24 11:55:17	haxmeister	reisio, but locally people know my hobbies and occationally I earn a few bucks or some brownie points for applying it
2016-02-24 11:55:25	haxmeister	reisio, probably
2016-02-24 11:55:56	reisio	getting into 3d milling is pretty high on my once-life-is-easier todo list
2016-02-24 11:56:16	reisio	far saner than 3d printing, IMO, in quite a lot of ways
2016-02-24 11:56:31	haxmeister	reisio, it's a no brainer for me.. about 20yrs doing it thus far
2016-02-24 11:56:48	reisio	it makes more sense to me, for example
2016-02-24 11:56:57	reisio	to take a piece of wood (or whatever), and mill it into what you want
2016-02-24 11:57:12	reisio	vs putting a million things into a blender and squeezing them out of an anus to print into what you want
2016-02-24 11:57:21	haxmeister	lol
2016-02-24 11:57:25	reisio	you agree?
2016-02-24 11:57:54	Digit	since i saw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk3A41U0iO4 i agree that 3d milling our own toys is the future.
2016-02-24 11:58:01	Digit	s/toys/tools/
2016-02-24 11:58:05	reisio	although I guess I wouldn't personally want to limit it to milling strictly

2016-02-24 11:58:21	reisio	you could after all shape wood mechnically without rotary whittling
2016-02-24 11:58:50	Digit	oh for librecad to get some 3d savvy
2016-02-24 11:58:52	reisio	well I mean, you can cut down a tree (that you grew, sustainably), and mill it

2016-02-24 11:59:02	Digit	i'm not ready to do 3d modeling in emacs!
2016-02-24 11:59:03	reisio	you can't do that with modern widespread plastics
2016-02-24 11:59:29	reisio	Digit: hah, this has a good start
2016-02-24 12:00:02	Digit	reisio: no reason to rule that possibility out alltogether though.  some hemp, some clever cracking n whatnot, bam, grow your own bio-plastics.
2016-02-24 12:00:22	reisio	yeah of course
2016-02-24 12:00:27	reisio	Ford had his hemp plastic car way back when
2016-02-24 12:00:35	reisio	it's still absurdly hard to legally farm hemp in the USA, for example
2016-02-24 12:00:43	reisio	even when marijuana is more and more legal
2016-02-24 12:00:58	reisio	canada is close, but that's a different country
2016-02-24 12:01:28	reisio	with hemp I'd want to get into vertical farming, too
2016-02-24 12:01:30	Digit	any most of the world.   there's incumberances n impediments to hemp proliferation everywhere.  tis "the competition" to too many industry
2016-02-24 12:01:37	reisio	taking up all the land with farming is also absurd :D
2016-02-24 12:01:47	reisio	well it's silly, particularly in the USA
2016-02-24 12:01:51	reisio	hemp was huge for WWII
2016-02-24 12:02:05	reisio	and again, marijuana being legalized everywhere
2016-02-24 12:02:15	reisio	my understanding is that you just plain cannot really get high on hemp
2016-02-24 12:02:28	reisio	and even if you could, who would bother when the crazy bred-for-brain-destruction stuff is legal more and more
2016-02-24 12:03:03	Digit	i quite like the idea of underground farming...  with efficient led, n the right spectrum's to fire off photosynthesis, at the optimal refresh rate for further efficiencies... no reason to not do so, powered by solar!  even with the relative inefficiencies of converting lums to volts.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:03:09	reisio	programmatic 3d modelling, nom nom
2016-02-24 12:03:19	Digit	whole huge swathes of abandoned mines doing nothing
2016-02-24 12:03:27	reisio	yeah...
2016-02-24 12:03:36	reisio	I thought about that
2016-02-24 12:03:38	reisio	it worries me a little
2016-02-24 12:03:44	reisio	important things are kept under the ground
2016-02-24 12:03:57	reisio	whereas the creatures of the air don't usually begrudge another place to sit and crap from
2016-02-24 12:04:12	reisio	I'm guessing underwater would also work great
2016-02-24 12:04:25	reisio	there are after all essentially deserts here and there in the ocean
2016-02-24 12:04:31	reisio	just empty unused space, for the most part
2016-02-24 12:04:42	reisio	though if you built something there we'd probably notice quickly that they weren't actually empty :p
2016-02-24 12:04:56	reisio	there's always extra-terrestrial farming, though
2016-02-24 12:05:16	reisio	AIUI plants do crazy things when exposed to a little extra solar radiation
2016-02-24 12:05:16	Digit	antartica pretty big.   what it doing?  besides being a big UV hole, and vast area to hide the secret bunkers and rocket hangers. ^_^
2016-02-24 12:05:42	reisio	IIRC the chinese sent fruit and veggie seeds up into space and when they grew them later on they produced /CRAZY LARGE/ fruits
2016-02-24 12:05:52	reisio	yeah...
2016-02-24 12:05:57	reisio	antarctica...
2016-02-24 12:06:01	reisio	is problematic for political reasons
2016-02-24 12:06:18	Digit	should get those lazy penguins doing something...  then with a job to do, and trained up for, they wouldnt huddle around doing nothing all the time.
2016-02-24 12:06:18	reisio	as soon as it's a little warmer there, people will fight over its land
2016-02-24 12:06:33	reisio	and in the meantime you can't claim much of it, because the big guys have all these treaties
2016-02-24 12:06:42	Digit	meh.  spaceships for everyone.
2016-02-24 12:06:42		[12:06]
2016-02-24 12:06:46	reisio	what I'd really like is to find a nice unused bit of the sahara
2016-02-24 12:06:55	reisio	preferably away from where the French did their nuclear testing
2016-02-24 12:07:02	reisio	or central Australian desert
2016-02-24 12:07:10	Digit	i cant be bothered with playing along with the manufactured scarcity any more.  enough's enough.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:07:11	reisio	...also preferably away from where the English did /their/ nuclear testing
2016-02-24 12:07:27	reisio	manufactured scarcity?
2016-02-24 12:07:58	Digit	like planned obsolecense, n other forms of profitable supression.
2016-02-24 12:08:31	Digit	heh, like proprietary software. ^_^
2016-02-24 12:08:45	reisio	you mean like how people think we're running out of water and land?
2016-02-24 12:08:50	reisio	when really we just have too many people? :p
2016-02-24 12:09:18	reisio	the great upcoming famines will sort that out, shame we have to wait
2016-02-24 12:09:26	reisio	wow
2016-02-24 12:09:29	reisio	coffee is doing its thing
2016-02-24 12:09:31	Digit	ugh.  too many people for what?  for the space n resources?  we're in an ever expanding universe.  look up.   ample.   abundant.  spaceships for everyone.  no need for a cull.
2016-02-24 12:09:37	*	reisio answers the phone with nature on the line
2016-02-24 12:09:48	reisio	Digit: oh yeah, that too
2016-02-24 12:09:55	reisio	extraterrestrial mining will be big
2016-02-24 12:10:15	reisio	and it's... fairly hard to consider who will miss, for example, a barren rock in space that's made of thoroughly useful materials
2016-02-24 12:10:19	Digit	maybe.  depends how much of a handle we all get on free energy and energ-matter conversion
2016-02-24 12:10:20	reisio	not impossible, but fairly hard
2016-02-24 12:10:30	reisio	shitload of carbon out there $
2016-02-24 12:10:41	reisio	eh
2016-02-24 12:10:48	reisio	free energy would be nice, but we honestly don't need it
2016-02-24 12:10:49	reisio	for the same reason
2016-02-24 12:10:51	haxmeister	reisio, do you do 3D modeling then?
2016-02-24 12:10:55	reisio	we don't have too little energy, we have too many people
2016-02-24 12:11:04	reisio	haxmeister: no, not regularly, I've only dabbled
2016-02-24 12:11:11	Digit	too many people again?   for what?
2016-02-24 12:11:16	reisio	played with shapeways stuff a bit
2016-02-24 12:11:23	reisio	Digit: for the resources easily exploited
2016-02-24 12:11:31	haxmeister	reisio, I've been thinking about making a simple thermal generator using the seeback effect
2016-02-24 12:11:33	reisio	that is: those at hand, on this planet
2016-02-24 12:11:36	reisio	for now :p
2016-02-24 12:11:44	haxmeister	reisio, I can machine the parts after hours at work :-D
2016-02-24 12:12:08	Digit	says those who seek to profit from the perception that the resources are scarce and precious
2016-02-24 12:12:17	reisio	haxmeister: what's the roadblock in making energy that way?
2016-02-24 12:12:37	haxmeister	reisio, efficiency
2016-02-24 12:12:42	reisio	Digit: I'm sure those people say it, too
2016-02-24 12:12:55	reisio	haxmeister: so not enough to satisfy the needs of the current population? :p
2016-02-24 12:13:13	reisio	(^ again, plenty of free energy, just not for the number of people we presently have)
2016-02-24 12:13:14	haxmeister	reisio, depends on how you define "needs" I guess
2016-02-24 12:13:20	reisio	yeah
2016-02-24 12:13:32	Digit	every decade the water powered car has been (re)-"invented".    *shrug*   so if there's a resource we're short on, it's whatever it is that prevents those types of suppressive industrial espionage.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:13:47	haxmeister	I'm sure I could build one to charge a car battery with minimal expense
2016-02-24 12:13:48	reisio	agreed, we aren't short on resources
2016-02-24 12:14:04	reisio	I'd say a water powered mass transit system would be better, though :)
2016-02-24 12:14:06	Digit	cept wisdom perhaps.

2016-02-24 13:13:00	michaelrose	it would be nice to have a chrome or chromium binary package like the firefox one
2016-02-24 13:16:19	reisio	google-chrome-stable/beta, no?
2016-02-24 13:16:24	reisio	like that on Gentoo, at least
2016-02-24 13:16:59	michaelrose	oh I really should have looked at the ebuild
2016-02-24 13:17:13	michaelrose	looks like it just gets the deb
2016-02-24 13:17:27	reisio	:D
2016-02-24 13:17:39	reisio	I think since there's google-chrome, and it's /only/ binary
2016-02-24 13:17:47	reisio	they forego the chromium-bin you might otherwise expect to exist
2016-02-24 13:17:55	michaelrose	I thought all binary packages were postfixed with -bin
2016-02-24 13:18:02	michaelrose	but that is not a good assumption
2016-02-24 13:18:07	reisio	it's only for disambiguating, yeah
2016-02-24 13:18:14	reisio	like 'opera' has never had a -bin
2016-02-24 13:18:19	reisio	because it's only ever been binary
2016-02-24 13:18:31	reisio	perhaps non-ideal, but binaries are in general, so
2016-02-24 13:18:36	*	reisio sups
