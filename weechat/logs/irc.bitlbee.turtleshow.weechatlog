2016-02-18 20:29:09	fsociety	you are now my friend :)
2016-02-18 20:29:09		[20:29]
2016-02-18 22:09:24	turtleshow	Hooray :) hehe
2016-02-18 22:09:24		[22:09]
2016-02-18 22:09:50	fsociety	welcome to the dark dean web
2016-02-18 22:10:04	fsociety	i'm online 24/7. if not on my machine, my phone is constantly connected
2016-02-18 22:10:20	turtleshow	Hehe I feel honored to be welcomed :p
2016-02-18 22:10:36	fsociety	i'm always more than happy to add other people if they want to use it for personal use. its like using msn all over again :)
2016-02-18 22:10:38	turtleshow	Awesome, I'm always on my phone too
2016-02-18 22:11:20	turtleshow	Cool, I'll keep it in mind, it is more fun using underground tech rather than the mainstream
2016-02-18 22:12:30	fsociety	makes you a l33t h4x0r
2016-02-18 22:12:53	fsociety	i do it find amusing that every time phil sees me sit down at a linux terminal his head explodes ;)
2016-02-18 22:17:10	fsociety	when i was at linuxconf someone gave me a $150 vps hosting voucher with data centres in nsw and qld. so at some point im going to migrate across to that. cheaper than digital ocean
2016-02-18 22:17:31	fsociety	haha oh btw. i went out of my way to get really drunk with the community manager of github the other week
2016-02-18 22:17:37	fsociety	that was amusing
2016-02-18 22:18:33	turtleshow	Cool, that would have been a fun conversation, what's he like?
2016-02-18 22:19:19	turtleshow	Yes, Phil and console terminals don't compute... It needs a shiny gui for his brain to enjoy it, which is why I think ue4 works so well for him :p
2016-02-18 22:20:28	turtleshow	I haven't looked into hosting for a long time, had one through an old contact but that was years ago
2016-02-18 22:20:48	fsociety	oh yeah i couldn't do anything of the stuff he does, i wish i could.  hes a huge metal head, most of the time we just sat and talked about metal. he's a guitarist
2016-02-18 22:20:57	fsociety	he used to be the community manager for ubuntu
2016-02-18 22:23:12	turtleshow	Awesome, sounds like a down to earth kinda person... Github is hugley popular with the devs I know
2016-02-18 22:23:25	turtleshow	This statistic disturbs me: http://mashable.com/2015/09/21/selfie-deaths/#NmSQG6Ekakq1
2016-02-18 22:23:48	fsociety	yeah it is, i use it tons. and how does that not surprise me selfies
2016-02-18 22:23:54	fsociety	i can't do it, i can't do selfies
2016-02-18 22:24:15	turtleshow	It's safe not to...
2016-02-18 22:24:32	fsociety	i just can't be apart of today's digital culture. doesn't agree with me
2016-02-18 22:24:32		[22:24]
2016-02-18 22:24:32	turtleshow	*safer
2016-02-18 22:24:42	fsociety	i think it is the narcisstic element of it
2016-02-18 22:30:00		[22:24]
2016-02-18 22:40:21	turtleshow	Well, it use to be something... Then somewhere in the mid 2000s it stopped being that and started being something much much more disappointing... Now, all we can do is clutch to what remains and hope the mainstream finds a new toy to play with
2016-02-18 22:40:59	fsociety	and here i am deliberately becoming more niche, refusing to remove myself from pc usage from 80s to the late 90s ;)
2016-02-18 22:45:45	turtleshow	Heh, in at the other end where the only things that excite or interest me are the experimental non commercial things such as using DNA to store data and bionics that connect to nerve endings. Time to stop messing around and get into the future that the 80s promised already!
2016-02-18 22:45:45		[22:45]
2016-02-18 22:46:26	fsociety	where is my flying car for christ sake
2016-02-18 22:46:34	fsociety	hey at least the off-world colony starts this year
2016-02-18 22:46:37	fsociety	...according to blade runner

2016-02-19 11:04:02	fsociety	excellent. busy today?
2016-02-19 11:10:00		[11:04]
2016-02-19 11:28:31	turtleshow	On and off in bursts, usually it's meetings that keep me busy... AMD they are usually quite boring 'p
2016-02-19 11:28:31		[11:28]
2016-02-19 11:28:40	turtleshow	What you working on at the moment?
2016-02-19 11:30:02	fsociety	re-writing a code generator for all of our companies products in python.. the old guy wrote it in vb8 and .net and i screamed "nooo" so i said i'm going to rewrite it platform agnostic
2016-02-19 11:30:22	fsociety	been in a python rabbit hole the past two weeks
2016-02-19 11:30:33	fsociety	ooo. pythons and rabbits
2016-02-19 11:30:39	fsociety	not a good combination when i think about it
2016-02-19 11:36:00		[11:30]
2016-02-19 11:53:34	turtleshow	Hehe as longs as the Python eats the rabbit then no more holes!!
2016-02-19 11:53:34		[11:53]
2016-02-19 11:53:52	turtleshow	Sounds like something interesting / challenging to be working on at the least
2016-02-19 11:59:00		[11:53]
2016-02-19 12:59:53	turtleshow	Oh, your not supposed to have those? Hehe
2016-02-19 12:59:53		[12:59]
2016-02-19 13:00:00	turtleshow	Ugh, 4 hrs to go
2016-02-19 13:02:36	fsociety	yeah i know
2016-02-19 13:02:51	fsociety	go home.... and go blat.. maybe compile ue4
2016-02-19 13:02:59	fsociety	not just install, but compile.. lol
2016-02-19 13:08:00		[13:02]
2016-02-19 13:10:04	fsociety	you know i could go one step furthur
2016-02-19 13:10:08	fsociety	lets start our own darknet
2016-02-19 13:10:09	fsociety	https://hyperboria.net/
2016-02-19 13:16:00		[13:10]
2016-02-19 13:17:10	turtleshow	Hehe I think I'd rather just build stuff in ue4... The results are more entertaining ;)
2016-02-19 13:17:56	turtleshow	Lol, we could consider that but all the unwanted attention from government agencies might be a bit of a drag
2016-02-19 13:20:45	fsociety	im probably already on a watchlist
2016-02-19 13:20:52	fsociety	even all my family members think so
2016-02-19 13:20:53	fsociety	haha
2016-02-19 13:26:00		[13:20]
2016-02-19 13:40:05	turtleshow	Hehe why am I not suprised? Though there is a difference from being on a watch list and being actively pursued
2016-02-19 13:40:25	fsociety	i'm not actively being pursued, cause i'd know in 2 seconds
2016-02-19 13:46:00		[13:40]
2016-02-19 14:51:51	turtleshow	Hehe true true :p
2016-02-19 14:51:51		[14:51]
2016-02-19 14:52:16	turtleshow	Gotta take the kitties to the vets tonight... Starting g to realise how much more complicated two are compared to one hehe
2016-02-19 14:58:00		[14:52]
2016-02-19 15:00:44	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-19 15:00:46	fsociety	welcome to the club
2016-02-19 15:01:08	fsociety	i said that to phil actually, and phil goes we've had to before.. but in my head that was between the both of you

2016-02-20 17:23:48		[17:23]
2016-02-20 19:34:39	fsociety	kodi?
2016-02-20 19:34:39		[19:34]
2016-02-20 19:34:45	fsociety	or the plex alternative which is called emby
2016-02-20 19:40:00		[19:34]
2016-02-20 20:04:22	turtleshow	Kodi, that's the one - thanks. I'm thinking of getting a raspberry pi to replace my pc for TV and torrents.. Just researching options at the moment
2016-02-20 20:04:22		[20:04]
2016-02-20 20:05:29	fsociety	pi is a decent option, but only if you want to use linux
2016-02-20 20:05:42	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
2016-02-20 20:07:56	turtleshow	Yeah, that's what I've noticed, fairly comfortable with Linux, just depends how easy the version for pi is to use heh
2016-02-20 20:07:56		[20:07]
2016-02-20 20:08:12	fsociety	you get raspbian by default i think, which is debian
2016-02-20 20:09:19	turtleshow	Mainly used Ubuntu but nothing Google can't help with when I get stuck, might also hassle you for some tips here and there
2016-02-20 20:09:32	fsociety	ubuntu is essentially debian
2016-02-20 20:09:36	fsociety	ubuntu is based off debian :)
2016-02-20 20:13:28	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
2016-02-20 20:27:09	turtleshow	Cool, that'll make it a bit easier then :-)
2016-02-20 20:27:09		[20:27]
2016-02-20 20:30:21	fsociety	but
2016-02-20 20:30:26	fsociety	i'd recommend buying the minix kodi boxc
2016-02-20 20:30:30	fsociety	i'll get you a link
2016-02-20 20:31:20	fsociety	http://minix.com.hk/en/products/neo-x8-h-plus
2016-02-20 20:37:00		[20:31]
2016-02-20 20:52:34	turtleshow	Ooo that looks very funky, hmmm okay, reconsidering options now
2016-02-20 20:52:34		[20:52]
2016-02-20 21:25:24	fsociety	it plays 4k perfectly fine
2016-02-20 21:25:24		[21:25]
2016-02-20 22:03:18	turtleshow	Hehe could you imagine how long it would take me to download a single 4k movie? The standard would have jumped by the time it finished. Though an going to chat to the electrician next door to see if he can help out with the cable
2016-02-20 22:03:18		[22:03]

2016-02-22 10:01:57	fsociety	firewatch, downfall redux and layers of fear
2016-02-22 10:02:09	fsociety	i burnt myself out, i couldn't even watch television after doing that
2016-02-22 10:02:12	fsociety	you?
2016-02-22 10:03:09	turtleshow	Hehe wow, 3 is a huge effort! I got stuck into Tropico 5 a fair bit but nowhere near your effort hehe
2016-02-22 10:03:39	turtleshow	Monday is as Monday is... Actually working from home waiting for an electrician at the moment
2016-02-22 10:04:00	turtleshow	Which game would you rate the nest out of the 3?
2016-02-22 10:04:20	fsociety	firewatch is the best
2016-02-22 10:04:32	fsociety	actually tbh all 3 were pretty amazing, which is very rare
2016-02-22 10:05:57	turtleshow	I'll have to have a look at them on steam, not too familiar with the titles
2016-02-22 10:06:29	fsociety	they are all very new
2016-02-22 10:08:40	fsociety	wish i could from home today
2016-02-22 10:08:50	fsociety	you are "working from home" :)
2016-02-22 10:09:51	turtleshow	Lol yes, very ineffectively working from couch... I've logged in, that's a start
2016-02-22 10:10:09	fsociety	and using error418 chat
2016-02-22 10:15:56	fsociety	other than nothing much, oh actually i burnt the inside of my throat on cheese from a pizza
2016-02-22 10:15:56		[10:15]
2016-02-22 10:15:58	fsociety	smart me
2016-02-22 10:16:32	turtleshow	Ouch! The inside of your throat!? Sounds very painful
2016-02-22 10:16:56	fsociety	yeah not pleasant, gets irritated whenever i eat something new
2016-02-22 10:22:00		[10:16]
2016-02-22 10:24:57	turtleshow	Hope it doesn't take long to heal.. Eating is kind of essential
