2016-02-18 22:01:46	@degville	Devilment: I loved Boyhood. Found it very moving, despite not having much in common with the 'boy'. Watched The Revenant last night. 10/10 for effort. 4/10 for the film itself.
2016-02-18 22:02:20	fs0ciety	Something about Leo I just don't like
2016-02-18 22:02:26	fs0ciety	I think he tries that little bit too hard
2016-02-18 22:03:07	@degville	Yeah. I think he's well cast in Wolf of Wall Street. And also Django Unchained. Tom Hardy would have been better for the lead in The Revenant imo.
2016-02-18 22:04:51	fs0ciety	Hardy's great. Legend was awesome.. I kept putting on the voice of Ronnie for days
2016-02-18 22:05:16	fs0ciety	Walked around the house and speaking to my housemates like that. Haha they probably got irritated, but I amused myself :)
2016-02-18 22:06:41	fs0ciety	i'd imagine Hardy would be a big contender for the next Bond actually

2016-02-18 22:14:57	@degville	Yeah, I think you're right, unless he decline the potential stereotype. He's one of those actors who seems to actually act, rather than relying on the cliche of menace.

2016-02-18 23:28:57	Devilment	In Django Unchained, enforced method acting by Leo. He really did cut his hand on the glass
2016-02-18 23:29:36	Devilment	It's why the rest of the actors are looking at each other shiftedly
2016-02-18 23:30:00	Devilment	They were expecting QT to shout "Cut!" (No pun intended)

2016-02-18 23:31:15	Devilment	I wasn't a fan of Leo when I was younger, mainly because of the Titanic hype, but was won over by his performance in 'Catch Me If You Can'
2016-02-18 23:31:58	@degville	I felt the same. Didn't know about the hand... and yes, Catch Me If You Can is good.

2016-02-19 01:23:00	mcphail	I suspect this is all going to end in tears (or a bespoke licensing agreement between Canonical and Oracle)
2016-02-19 01:23:00		[01:23]
2016-02-19 01:24:21	popey	maybe such an agreement exists?
2016-02-19 01:25:22	mcphail	Got to hope so, although it would make me sad as it would make the Ubuntu kernel less free

2016-02-20 05:13:59	mcphail	popey: why not...!
2016-02-20 05:14:02	popey	 😃
2016-02-20 05:14:11	mcphail	http://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/02/18/zfs-licensing-and-linux/ - that is sailing pretty close to the wind. To state that a kernel object is not a derivative work of the kernel is _one_ interpretation
2016-02-20 05:16:53	mcphail	Now, my understanding is it is the GPL, rather than the CDDL, which forbids ZFS as a kernel module. Nvidia attempt to bypass this by providing a shim which the user compiles themselves between non-GPL compliant code and the kernel. Is there going to be a similar dkms'ed shim layer here?
2016-02-20 05:16:53		[05:16]
2016-02-20 05:18:33	mcphail	The google/oracle stushie already points to the header files falling under copyright (hence licence) of the original work, so using the kernel header files (to my mind) makes a module a derivative work
2016-02-20 05:21:04	*	mcphail thinks that even if Canonical are correct here, there FUD surrounding the issue is not going to attract business

2016-02-20 05:32:58		[05:32]
2016-02-20 05:33:25	mcphail	I don't know why Canonical do these things. It always causes so much of a distraction, and diverts them from more useful work.
2016-02-20 05:33:35	popey	these things?
2016-02-20 05:33:41	popey	What our customers ask for 😖
2016-02-20 05:34:11	mcphail	Actions which are questionable (at best) to the community.
2016-02-20 05:35:27	mcphail	It is particulary sad, because the future of ZFS in any context is becoming fuzzy. It isn't clear how much impetus Oracle are putting behind it
2016-02-20 05:36:20	mcphail	Technically, it is a good solution just now for certain cases. But growing/developing btrfs surely has to be the preferred option in the long run
2016-02-20 05:36:39	popey	we already have btrfs, it's been in ubuntu for aeons
2016-02-20 05:36:44	popey	but it's just not stable

2016-02-20 05:36:50	popey	Not a lot _we_ can do about that
2016-02-20 05:37:07	popey	I mean, SUSE have it as the default FS on their installs, but they have staff who work on btrfs (AIUI)
2016-02-20 05:37:26	popey	we don't have any btrfs skills in house (not that we have zfs skills AFAIK)
2016-02-20 05:38:03	popey	I love btrfs, but it seems the wider free software community has spoken and zfs is the annointed one
2016-02-20 05:38:56	mcphail	Well, I suspect this is going to be painful

2016-02-20 06:57:48	einonm	A $(prev employer) used to have a load of proprietary drivers released under the 'other-os-developed' GPL exception. It's a massive pain, as you can't use a lot of kernel functionality within the other code. And it also has the side affect of no one other than the company that 'owns' the other code actually works on those kernels - which I assume is the state Canonical is already in, as there's bugger all 'community' development of ubuntu kernels anyway
2016-02-20 06:58:00	 > 	chemist69 (~apl@a89-182-60-153.net-htp.de) has joined #linuxvoice
2016-02-20 07:00:22	einonm	result is, kernels that are developed proprietary-style that are of poorer quality, because no one company can keep up with the pace of kernel development. Best of luck with that.

2016-02-21 04:34:07	Devilment	I use autoaway.pl on irssi. It just sets me away, no nick change

2016-02-21 04:43:25	SuperEngineer	oh, if only all "offenders" did similar, Devilment
2016-02-21 04:46:05	SuperEngineer	no names, no pack drill eh, foxhunt_away [& lcawte on #ubuntu-uk]... but no names, no pack drill. [/me chuckles]
2016-02-21 04:46:09	zmoylan-pi	you can always mark them as ignored
2016-02-21 04:46:19	SuperEngineer	[done!]
2016-02-21 04:48:54	SuperEngineer	[but every now & then I "unignore"... & regret it!]  ;-)
2016-02-21 04:49:30	Devilment	I should use my hi-fi stack more often to listen to my music rather than my PC
2016-02-21 04:49:43	Devilment	Been doing that this afternoon, far punchier
2016-02-21 04:50:16	Devilment	Although, I'd accidentally turned the volume up to 11 when dusting
2016-02-21 04:50:33	Devilment	It were a bit loud when the first track kicked in
2016-02-21 04:52:39	SuperEngineer	So why turn it down?  Temporary deafness is a very under rated result sometimes ;-)
2016-02-21 04:54:07	Devilment	Amp is 68W, speakers are rated for 100W. Didn't want to clip and potentially damage driver coils
2016-02-21 04:54:40	Devilment	Audiolab 8000S, very clean, very neutral amp
2016-02-21 04:55:20	zmoylan-pi	my brother picked up an amp as a teenager that came with speakers the size of stools.  when connected to his stereo and volume set to 3 it sounded like pub across road was having concert... :-)
2016-02-21 04:55:20		[04:55]
2016-02-21 04:56:58	Devilment	My speakers are about 30 years old. Mission 762i
2016-02-21 04:57:13	Devilment	They have the woofer over the tweeter
2016-02-21 04:57:25	Devilment	Good bass on them
2016-02-21 04:57:48	*	SuperEngineer keeps mouth shut & hides jealousy
2016-02-21 04:58:10	Devilment	Over the amp or speakers?
2016-02-21 05:04:00		[04:58]
2016-02-21 05:12:16	SuperEngineer	yes
2016-02-21 05:16:23	*	SuperEngineer has speakers rated to 1000W [each], has an amp that begs to drive up to "fun" level... but doesn't live where it can be used
2016-02-21 05:19:11	SuperEngineer	so puts up with mediocre 6 way home cinema player for all use... but... but...but...

2016-02-21 21:14:37	charlesay	on a scale from one to project ending, where is that linux mint compromise set?
2016-02-21 21:15:56	zmoylan-pi	probably 2-3, a security cockup. but i'm glad it occurred and was caught
2016-02-21 21:18:07	mcphail	what happened?
2016-02-21 21:18:07		[21:18]
2016-02-21 21:19:45	mcphail	http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994 - aargh. Nasty
2016-02-21 21:22:07	zmoylan-pi	spring is here, the daily mail hacker is no longer wearing a hoodie... :-) http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/12/0236EF8900000578-3452774-image-m-93_1455800012124.jpg
2016-02-21 21:22:12	mcphail	Depressingly, they've published MD5 hashes under "How to check if your ISO is compromised?" rather than something signed with their GPG key. FFS
2016-02-21 21:22:53	zmoylan-pi	more people would know how to use a hash probably
2016-02-21 21:23:40	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: a hash is useless if the scumbags can rewrite your website and modify the MD5s
2016-02-21 21:24:11	zmoylan-pi	the server they got access to is still down according to that blog
2016-02-21 21:24:52	mcphail	Yes, but looks as if it had been kept up for a further 24h after the initial discovering, hosting a new compromised .ISO

2016-02-21 21:29:31	charlesay	what is the point of a linux distro: packaging linux and other stuff into something useful and deliver it to people. that is exactly what they fucked up enormously
2016-02-21 21:32:21	charlesay	they should have signed the isos with gpg keys (that others aren't doing this either doesn't make it any better). they/we should use secure boot to mitigate this. they shouldn't host their isos on the same box/vm as their bloody wordpress. they shouldn't use md5. they shouldn't need to be told by people commenting on the blog that the site is still/again compromised...

Knowing I can move/live around Europe is a huge part of what I consider my identity. Less integration takes us down an increasingly insular path, and I find that thought very depressing.

2016-02-23 02:30:53	Blackisle	one of the usual opt-out issues is the huge amount of red-tape you need to go through to sell stuff in the EU. We manufacture machines so the vast majority oif the red-tape is to do with the CE mark
2016-02-23 02:31:12	Blackisle	whether we're in or out, you still need a CE mark to sell in the EU
2016-02-23 02:31:42	Blackisle	so it's idiotic not to be part of the EU and at least try to steer some of the standards decisions made

2016-02-23 20:22:36	zmoylan-pi	i don't think it even comes close to worst video game
2016-02-23 20:23:37	zmoylan-pi	atari who spent millions for rights to a game which they rushed out in 3 weeks with 1 programmer are to blame methinks
2016-02-23 20:28:28	Devilment	In the 90s, I "played" a game called Pax <something> from a French software house. Set in the future, there was background radiation as a hazard. Said radiation killed my character within 5 minutes.
2016-02-23 20:28:28		[20:28]
2016-02-23 20:28:41	Devilment	That was the worst game I ever played
2016-02-23 20:28:59	zmoylan-pi	collywobbles on zx spectrum, a gauntlet clone, unplayable
2016-02-23 20:29:17	Devilment	4-5 cycles of "Start game. Die." and I uninstalled it
2016-02-23 20:30:19	zmoylan-pi	i just pushed tape to back of shelf and never loaded it again...
2016-02-23 20:32:50	mcphail	I think, to be properly bad, a game must have had some degree of hype and expectation which it spectacularly failed to meet. There are 1000s of back-bedroom Speccy games which were awful, but no-one would have expected them to be good
2016-02-23 20:33:54	zmoylan-pi	well collywobbles had great looking graphics and synthisized speech and sound so effort HAD been put in
2016-02-23 20:34:08	zmoylan-pi	but was ruined by bugs
2016-02-23 20:35:15	zmoylan-pi	about a 1/3 of the games i had were never reviewed by magazines so you had no other way of knowing what to avoid for a lot of games
2016-02-23 20:35:36	zmoylan-pi	no internet to check them out
2016-02-23 20:40:29	Devilment	Daikatana, Duke Nukem Forever

2016-02-23 20:43:27	mcphail	I've been tempted to but Daikatana, to see if it is as bad as everyone says
2016-02-23 20:43:31	mcphail	*buy

2016-02-23 20:54:12	Devilment	I picked up a couple of LED "golfball" bulbs y'day from Poundland. Rated at 5W / 330lm.

2016-02-23 20:55:08	Devilment	They're to be used in a couple of mood-lighting lamps, but I tried them in my wall lights first, just to see how they compared to the 8W CFLs I'm already using
2016-02-23 20:55:33	Devilment	I was surprised they were just as bright, if not a touch brighter

2016-02-23 20:56:19	Devilment	At £1/bulb, it'll take a year for them to pay back their costs if I replaced them :)

2016-02-23 20:57:29	mcphail	CFLs need to die. Horrible horrible things
2016-02-23 20:58:08	james_olympus	Sounds good.  My kitchen has ten 20W halogens.  I don't like to use the ceiling lights, they're close to gaming graphics card territory
2016-02-23 20:58:16	Devilment	I've used low energy lighting since I got the house, so have no comparison to running lighting using incandescents
2016-02-23 20:58:41	Devilment	Often wondered how much a reduction people who have swapped over see in their leccy bills
2016-02-23 20:58:41		[20:58]
2016-02-23 20:59:15	mcphail	Devilment: they're nasty, and prone to explode. Wouldn't be so bad if they weren't full of mercury
2016-02-23 20:59:40	Devilment	Prone to explode?
2016-02-23 20:59:57	Devilment	And they're not full of mercury
2016-02-23 21:05:00		[20:59]
2016-02-23 21:11:06	Devilment	http://earthtechling.com/2011/10/the-mercury-myth-how-much-mercury-do-cfls-actually-contain/
2016-02-23 21:11:23	mcphail	Devilment: they fail with a bang. I had one pop like a gunshot a couple of months ago, followed by a foul cabbage smell. I'll admit "full of" is hyperbole, but they do contain mercury and they do explode
2016-02-23 21:11:47	*	mcphail would like to stress the foul cabbage smell did not come from his trousers
2016-02-23 21:12:45	Devilment	Well, I've never had one explode on me and that's from a house with one in nearly every fitting
2016-02-23 21:13:22	mcphail	http://www.maine.gov/dep/homeowner/cflreport.html
2016-02-23 21:17:11	Devilment	I still maintain the "ZOMG! Mercury!" risk is over-hyped for CFLs
2016-02-23 21:19:02	zmoylan-pi	still sitting on those cfl manufacturers shares? :-)
2016-02-23 21:19:23	Devilment	Nope
2016-02-23 21:19:49	Devilment	I have buggy-whip manufacturer shares though :)

2016-02-24 00:29:43	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: the code I wote in the 80's went '10 PRINT "McPhail Rules OK" 20 GOTO 10'
