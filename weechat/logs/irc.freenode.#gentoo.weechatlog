2016-01-20 22:24:37	username234	nagchampa: I still don't see how.  Menuconfig was probably written in ASCII and UTF-8 uses the same values... I'm also having trouble reproducing it by changing the locale from POSIX to en_US.UTF-8...

2016-01-20 22:25:03	nagchampa	username234, it wasn't menuconfig that was the problem
2016-01-20 22:25:22	nagchampa	menuconfig still uses non-ascii characters for borders and stuff, but it was outputting as utf-8
2016-01-20 22:25:32	nagchampa	screen however wasn't expecting utf-8 and so was getting confused
2016-01-20 22:25:59	nagchampa	once i told screen to use UTF-8 it was working fine
2016-01-20 22:26:37	nagchampa	normally screen will use utf-8 automatically if it detects that as the environment locale (i believe) however screen was being launched from the livecd environment which is not using a utf-8 locale

2016-01-21 01:11:02	SamWeasley	iamben - using libav
2016-01-21 01:11:09	BtbN	Yeah, don't do that.

2016-01-21 01:13:11	+iamben	SamWeasley: i think it has to do with new mpv, old ffmpeg/libav, and USE=vaapi.  i saw some mention of it yesterday, that mpv-0.15.0[vaapi] needs at least ffmpeg-2.7.2 or so... which might translate to libav-(future)
2016-01-21 01:13:41	BtbN	Hm, propably my fault.
2016-01-21 01:13:44	SamWeasley	iamben - though on that, put a -vaapi on libav
2016-01-21 01:13:53	SamWeasley	*mpv
2016-01-21 01:14:03	SamWeasley	worked
2016-01-21 01:14:10	BtbN	Or just use ffmpeg instead.

2016-01-21 01:14:28	+iamben	yes as BtbN suggests, mpv does prefer/track/support ffmpeg so you'll generally have much better success with that
2016-01-21 01:14:39	+iamben	most upstreams prefer ffmpeg over libav

2016-01-21 01:19:42	t4nk021	i have 6 identical computers all with gentoo same config
2016-01-21 01:19:47	SamWeasley	iamben - should I flag ffmpeg and -libav globally?

2016-01-21 01:20:09	berrp221	I'm planning a small home server and thinking of using gentoo for it.  Would y'all say genkernel has evolved well in the past 10ish years?

2016-01-21 01:21:25	BtbN	keep in mind that ffmpeg is the generic useflag that enabled support, and libav just switches between ffmpeg/libav

2016-01-21 01:21:50	+iamben	right, you probably already have global USE=ffmpeg, even on a libav system

2016-01-21 04:24:27	batninja	It may be one of the reasons why I gave up installing Gentoo.

2016-01-21 04:30:13	MachinaeWolf	like it's random too, sometimes it'll be good for hours and happen sometimes not long after computer is on
2016-01-21 04:30:14	BtbN	openrc is just a collection of scripts and small applications that start and stop other ones, it's basically impossible for it to cause that.
2016-01-21 04:30:33	BtbN	Sounds more like a hardware fault to me.

I already have a local portage (the standard "x-portage"), but I can't find any information about using it with the new system; is it because I actually don't need to do anything about it?

2016-01-21 06:40:34	petan	just wondering why vim doesn't come with gentoo by default? it's most common editor in world of UNIX much more than nano, which can be hardly found on more ancient systems
2016-01-21 06:40:47	artois	petan: for newbies' groking
2016-01-21 06:40:52	artois	petan: there's always busybox's vi
2016-01-21 06:40:56	artois	or just install vim
2016-01-21 06:41:00	artois	Gentoo comes with very little by default
2016-01-21 06:41:02	+iamben	petan: if we have to only bundle a single editor, nano is the most widely usable without extra training
2016-01-21 06:41:03	*	artois likes that
2016-01-21 06:41:11	stqn	andering: thanks… makes sense, but it wasn’t obvious… I’ve never had a similar problem before
2016-01-21 06:41:16	artois	malice: what's the emerge command?
2016-01-21 06:41:35	c0nd0rr	just installed windows and its replaced grub, do i need to be chrooted to do "grub2-install /dev/sdX" or can i just do it from the boot disk
2016-01-21 06:41:56	petan	hmm busybox is cool didn't notice
2016-01-21 06:41:59	petan	it's there
2016-01-21 06:42:04	artois	c0nd0rr: IIRC you don't have to chroot, but I probably would anyway
2016-01-21 06:42:31	artois	Vim has a learning curve
2016-01-21 06:42:37	artois	vi/Vim
2016-01-21 06:42:44	petan	frankly I wouldn't expect newbies to use gentoo :P

2016-01-21 06:43:07	artois	one could argue oldbies might'n't prefer vi/Vim as well
2016-01-21 06:43:11	artois	nano is very small, also
2016-01-21 06:43:18	+iamben	petan: we really dont need to add 2 more pages to the handbook to teach vim before new users can continue after chroot
2016-01-21 06:43:21	artois	it wouldn't be good if every editor were installed by default, to satisfy everyone
2016-01-21 06:43:25	artois	people can install their own preferred
2016-01-21 06:43:43	+iamben	nano is a good default, even if i personally always replace it with vim right away
2016-01-21 06:43:43	artois	petan: also, Gentoo is the first distro I ever installed =)
2016-01-21 06:43:47	c0nd0rr	artois, seems i do actually, just booted it up and it dosnt have grub installed :(
2016-01-21 06:44:01	artois	c0nd0rr: you might have to, or you might be in any number of other situations =)
2016-01-21 06:44:27	+iamben	malice: do you have anything quich requires qtphonon? i think in most cases you want to remove that
2016-01-21 06:44:29	petan	first distro I installed was debian 2 like more than 10 years ago I think... I was searching man for text editor and it suggested vim as a decent one
2016-01-21 06:44:31	malice	artois: The output is from 'USE="qt4 -vlc" emerge -av media-libs/phonon', but original command was 'emerge -a qtsmoke'
2016-01-21 06:44:39	c0nd0rr	artois, i mean gentoo install cd dosnt have grub
2016-01-21 06:44:39	artois	petan: good suggestion
2016-01-21 06:44:40	petan	then I had to unplug my PC from wall socket just to get out of vim
2016-01-21 06:44:40	petan	:D
2016-01-21 06:44:46	batninja	Err, from my experience (my rice is heating in the microwave), a lot of people use a lot of different software
2016-01-21 06:44:49	malice	iamben: I am not sure if I do, any way to check that, or just unmerge?
2016-01-21 06:45:04	+iamben	malice: try "emerge -cav qtphonon:4", see if it says safe to remove

2016-01-21 06:46:54	batninja	I tried but I'm not advanced enough to prefer vim other nano (I'm currently learning LaTeX for taking notes at the university)
2016-01-21 06:47:03	petan	well, back then when I installed my first distro, there were no things like virtualbox, I didn't even have good internet, I had to keep swapping my old P-ATA drive with windows 2000 just to read the
2016-01-21 06:47:04	petan	html pages with installation manual :P

2016-01-21 06:48:37	batninja	And it would be pretentious to install vim just to boast we have the best text editor that real l33t professionals use when you install it's easy, even more for advanced users, to install it using portage I think
2016-01-21 06:48:53	batninja	artois : thanks. Going afk for real. See you later :)
2016-01-21 06:49:02	malice	iamben: if I could only remember. I probably needed it for some reason.

2016-01-21 06:49:47	batninja	Oh, I forgot to say I have a bépo keyboard, so jkhl is not ergonomic and I tried to change the default keystrokes
2016-01-21 06:49:51	+iamben	malice: i dont think you need qt-meta.  if you do keep it, you can see its dep is baiscally "qtphonon or phonon[qt4]" so it shoudl be safe to remove qtphonon and let it get replaced by media-libs/phonon

2016-01-21 07:15:16	Gentoolman	andering: webkit is dependence of gimp

2016-01-21 07:16:23	jerichowasahoax	artois, jasom: I'm not going for file manager usage, I'm going for adb. Developer mode is enabled, and lsblk -f only shows my two internal hard drives

2016-01-21 07:17:56	+iamben	jerichowasahoax: if it doesn't show up in lsusb then something is wrong with the usb ports themselves on your machine, look for EHCI/XHCI drivers

2016-01-21 07:21:44	livingBEEF	cyphix: I find wpa_supplicant with wpa_gui to be much better than NM (though I used NM only on Mint).

2016-01-21 07:22:07	cyphix	So apparently, it comes from my current config. Any idea what could be missing? Here's the diff between my old and my current config: https://p.cyphix.org/view/54e1a974

2016-01-21 12:31:36	josef__k	Hmm... if I just want Java for running the occasional program or web app or whatever -- do I actually need USE=java? Or does it suffice to just "emerge jdk"?
2016-01-21 12:31:55	josef__k	I don't do any Java software development, for example.
2016-01-21 12:32:23	josef__k	Which is how I interpret the perl and python USE flags.
2016-01-21 12:33:10	artois	josef__k: USE flags are for optional things
2016-01-21 12:33:24	artois	all you need to run the occasional java app/script is a java jre

2016-01-21 12:34:45	artois	nobody makes java web apps anymore
2016-01-21 12:34:54	artois	not since java became universally recognized as a security black hole
2016-01-21 12:34:57	josef__k	I guess the description of the USE flag is not that helpful, for Java it just says "Add support for Java".

2016-01-21 12:35:23	josef__k	yeah, if you run 'euse -i java'
2016-01-21 12:35:29	johnfg	This is strange.  Completed an @world update while at 2nd job.  Did a reboot.
2016-01-21 12:35:37	artois	try emerge -n euses; euses java
2016-01-21 12:35:55	artois	eh, same info
2016-01-21 12:36:13	wraeth	it's because 'java' is a global flag and, globally, that's a valid description for it
2016-01-21 12:36:24	johnfg	sddm presents a window, but there is no user name, and nothing to do to select one!  Now, I'm logged in from tty2.
2016-01-21 12:36:30	josef__k	So there are package-specific descriptions too, which are more helpful.
2016-01-21 12:36:55	djdunn	does anybody use fglrx with amdgpu ?
2016-01-21 12:37:13	artois	djdunn: not sure anyone does with any other gpu...
2016-01-21 12:37:14	johnfg	It worked fine before the update.
2016-01-21 12:37:18	wraeth	josef__k: yes, but usually (though not always) a different flag would be used if it provides something other than what the global provides, otherwise you get conflict of interpretation and expectation
2016-01-21 12:37:24	josef__k	So I figure the moral of the story is that unless I'm actually developing in Java, I probably don't need USE=java.

2016-01-21 12:38:12	wraeth	josef__k: depends on tha package.. for example, USE=java on libreoffice adds user-level functionality to the application, not developer functionality
2016-01-21 12:38:22	wraeth	but it's still adding java support :D
2016-01-21 12:38:39	johnfg	The sddm screen just shows the time with the day and date underneath, then a < and a >,  with underneath it Select your user and enter password.
2016-01-21 12:38:50	josef__k	wraeth: Ahh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
2016-01-21 12:38:58	johnfg	But there's no users present, and I don't know what to do to get them.
2016-01-21 12:40:21	+grknight	interesting.. seems firefox may work better with open-source drivers if you install the optional media-libs/libtxc_dxtn

2016-01-21 12:43:05	josef__k	I would be nice to distinguish between a language flag that simply adds bindings to a package versus adds user functionality.

2016-01-21 14:02:29	+grknight	Hell-Razor: you are probably just need a script to unpack an archive and pack it backup on shutdown.  there was also articles on squashfs somewhere
2016-01-21 14:02:30	Hell-Razor	i dont think thats possible

2016-01-21 14:04:04	mark4	uefi is a liability. its not even a standard.  uefi on one machine is totally different to uefi on another
2016-01-21 14:04:14	+grknight	Hell-Razor: UEFI just needs a vfat parition flagged.. so i formatted /boot as vfat and everything just works
2016-01-21 14:04:22	Hell-Razor	ah
2016-01-21 14:04:26	Hell-Razor	i dont care enough
2016-01-21 14:04:28	+grknight	mark4: the same could be said about BIOS
2016-01-21 14:04:40	Hell-Razor	i was just curious if there was a good reason to use it grknight
2016-01-21 14:04:46	mark4	grknight, true but uefi is about a million times more complificated than BIOS lol
2016-01-21 14:05:08	mark4	so how do i grep all files in ALL directories under ~ ?
2016-01-21 14:05:12	mark4	including dot files/directories?
2016-01-21 14:05:27	+grknight	Hell-Razor: you should learn it as manufacturers are moving to it.  one day, Legacy mode might disappear

2016-01-21 14:06:17	mark4	usually somone chimes in with a command that will accomplish this. the lack of responses seriously worries me
2016-01-21 14:06:27	mark4	it cannot be that it is actually NOT possible?

2016-01-21 22:34:32	mva	Kelsar: how? as far as I tested, with -X it copies both content and xattrs, but with -Xu it copies neither :-/

2016-01-21 22:40:02	froller	The 'configure' command is NOT a standard Linux/UNIX command.
2016-01-21 22:40:03	froller	configure is a script that is generally provided with the source of most standardized type Linux packages and contains code that will "patch" and localize the source distribution so that it will compile and load on your local Linux system.
2016-01-21 22:40:14	wraeth	unsure: i'm pretty certain you're actually referring to the `./configure` script that is distributed with source code, which uses autotools to configure the build environment -> https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/autotools/index.html

2016-01-21 22:46:56	wraeth	unsure: if you can't find one, then you need to read the build/install instructions for the source, which will tell you what you need and how to do it

2016-01-21 22:59:06	O-Chymera	so fcron will only try to execute the command once a day and if not send me an email if it can? I assumed it would retry :-/

2016-01-22 00:32:11	wraeth	livingBEEF: i believe setting FEATURES="-parallel-fetch" should do it, but haven't tried it myself. you would set that in your make.conf if you want it permanently; though be aware that it means that it won't compile while fetching in the background, it will fetch in the foreground and  *then* compile

2016-01-22 00:36:07	livingBEEF	I guess there has to be some trade-off for being able to fetch and compile at the same time... though theoretically, it could show progress when it's waiting for something

2016-01-22 00:38:11	wraeth	livingBEEF: define waiting for something though - with most packages, the archives are small enough that by the time the first compile is done, you have the requisite files for the second. why wait when you can compile? :D

2016-01-22 01:50:44	cyphix	iamben: Oh... probably yes. But I have a vague memory that on a previous configuation, dispatch-conf was writing these flag modifications in files named according to the program that requested these changes, not inside a global file. I might be wrong though...
2016-01-22 01:51:36	cyphix	wraeth: I had indeed an old diff file that created a conflict. Now that it's removed, dispatch-conf asks to write inside /etc/portage/package.use/package.use, which is an improvement
2016-01-22 01:51:38	+iamben	cyphix: autounmask-write is what actually decides what to write where-- but they get staged for manual merging, just like any other /etc config chagne from emerge

2016-01-22 06:56:26	+iamben	things should go fine, grub will overwrite the windows bits in the boot sector, and you should configure grub to chainload windows

2016-01-22 08:28:50	metalhead33	At the #xfce channel, everyone told me to migrate from the closed-source Nvidia driver to Nouveau...
2016-01-22 08:28:55	metalhead33	And it turned out to be a disaster for me.
2016-01-22 08:29:17	+NeddySeagoon	metalhead33: Thats 1 1/2 graphics systems.  The nVidia card can only render images.

2016-01-22 10:24:34	birdie	iamben, I have been researching what exactly was the reason for firmware load fails, turns out to be a systemd-introduced issue.

2016-01-22 10:25:25	+iamben	birdie: well the firmware loader was removed from udev/systemd a while back, that's why you're supposed to disable the user helper option in the kernel

2016-01-22 11:09:06	meriipu	section1: try temporarily changing one of the use flags mentioned on lines 60-62 and run the emerge again, and keep temporarily changing use flags until it does not mention them anymore.
2016-01-22 11:09:32	sandy_storm	iamben: https://github.com/Airblader/i3/wiki/Compiling-&-Installing -- it doesn't seem t require a branch, now tat I look at it?
2016-01-22 11:09:38	meriipu	section1: and when the emerge finishes the dependencies should hopefully solve, and the temporary changes can be reverted and the emerge ran again

2016-01-22 11:10:21	+iamben	sandy_storm: looks like the defautl branch is gaps-next then, but the i3 ebuild forces "next" explicitly, i think you should override
2016-01-22 11:10:29	trix`G	if I make changes to my kernel using 'make menuconfig', then make && make modules_install && make install.  The next time I run make menuconfig, will those changes be there still or will I be presented with the original menuconfig?
2016-01-22 11:10:39	sandy_storm	iamben: Just override with a blank string?
2016-01-22 11:10:43	section1	meriipu, ok thanks i will follow that path
2016-01-22 11:11:01	+grknight	Scriptonaut: well does the daemon actually stay attached to that pid contained in the pidfile?
2016-01-22 11:11:04	sandy_storm	iamben: That seems to b working

2016-01-22 11:12:14	trix`G	I worded that terribly.  I just mean does make menuconfig load the kernel I've already customized or does it load a default that I have to re-customize?

2016-01-22 11:13:42	trix`G	iamben: so when I run 'make menuconfig' it gets the current settings from the same .config file it saves to when I exit?

2016-01-22 13:23:41	trix`G	Ok so weird problem, my laptop has both a touchpad for a mouse and the little nub thing between the G and H key as a mouse.  In console (with gpm) and other OS's including Gentoo LiveDVD both methods work fine to move the mouse cursor, simultaneously.
2016-01-22 13:24:32	trix`G	But in my new Gentoo install in LXDE the touchpad does not work.  The left and right click do and the Nub works and an external USB mouse works but the touchpad itself is totally ignored, until I CTRL+ALT+F2 my way to a tty console, then it works again
2016-01-22 13:24:47	+grknight	trix`G: did you set up synaptics for the touchpad?

2016-01-24 10:55:44	rui	Hi everyone. Regarding kernel upgrade, I do "make modules_prepare" before building the kernel. My question is: Do I have to do "emerge -av @module-rebuild" after "make install"?
2016-01-24 10:56:41	+iamben	rui: you do not need to do modules_prepare if you are going to do a full kernel build right after that.  you need to "emerge @module-rebuild" after the kernel build, IF you have 3rd party kernel modules

2016-01-24 10:58:23	+iamben	modules_prepare is for if you are NOT going to build a kernel, but you need to build some 3rd party modules FOR that kernel.  it does the bare minimum so the 3rd party modules can build.

2016-01-24 11:39:19	Schneesturms_	iamben, in all honesty, I'm not entirely sure. It's a habit I picked up from when I used arch, it's in their guide. However the Gentoo handbook explains that it's mostly useful for those who have separate usr and var partitions I think. I made it just to be safe, is it unnecessary?
2016-01-24 11:40:07	+iamben	Schneesturms_: basically you need it if you need some userland tools to help bring up rootfs, if your kernel is able to bring up rootfs by itself (without loading any modules) then you shouldn't need one
2016-01-24 11:41:27	Yatekii	grknight: dunno having versions on data feels weird ...
2016-01-24 11:41:46	Yatekii	and having to reconfigure the whole stuff with every new version feels weird too :S
2016-01-24 11:41:50	Schneesturms_	iamben, I'm not sure I follow. Do you think it has anything to do with the panic I received?

2016-01-24 11:42:34	+iamben	Schneesturms_: if the panic was a problem mounting rootfs, then it may have been because you were relying on initramfs to bring up rootfs, and the initramfs went missing

2016-01-24 12:00:40	AivarasK	What's the main difference with my ArchLinux install and Gentoo? With Arch, if I load computer (load is more than cores count) lets say music or other process starts glitching somethow or something like that. With gentoo I've been compiling stuff in paralels, load is 6.99 (4 cores) and I am listening to the music at 192kHz with no glitches. And system is more responsive in general. What makes for that difference?

2016-01-24 13:15:08	Yatekii	guys any advice on how to choose passwords? I mean I can't remember passwords for every single service (postgres main user, mailuser, postfix, owncloud db, etc) still they all need a password. and I rather don't use the one I use for other accounts of mine etc
2016-01-24 13:16:03	Poenikatu	Yatekii: Just do this: 82*x)]rqo A random collection of chars from the keyboard

2016-01-24 13:17:15	Yatekii	well that kinda voids the purpose of a pw ;9
2016-01-24 13:17:20	Yatekii	then I might as well have none^^
2016-01-24 13:17:42	Poenikatu	Yatekii: Ok, put the pw in your wallet. I you likely to lose that?

2016-01-24 15:46:13	kurly	fgro: your choice: build the firmware into the kernel, or stop building the driver into the kernel (ie, make it a module)
2016-01-24 15:47:15	konsolebox	kurly: granting, the module is in the encrypted partition?
2016-01-24 15:47:37	kurly	fgro: you'll want CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL enabled, CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR should be /lib/firmware (which I think is default), and CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE to include the firmware that your dmesg is complaining about

2016-02-07 08:26:02	TequilaTR	still - without a vision how you want your systems to be and to interact with you are also somehow lost
2016-02-07 08:26:31	+kojiro	I'm just saying systemd is a bit ungentoo-like
2016-02-07 08:26:37	mingdao	Some of us old purists are having a hard time; which is why I'm building this one box with systemd ... for force to me learn it.

2016-02-07 08:42:21	MattiMo	i saw a video one time where someone asked Linus why he doesn't use Gentoo
2016-02-07 08:42:32	TequilaTR	kojiro: exactly
2016-02-07 08:42:33	MattiMo	he basically said 'I ain't got no time for dat'
2016-02-07 08:43:05	TequilaTR	i think linus had some rant about it in the past, but then seemed to have consented to what MattiMo said

2016-02-07 08:43:42	nethershaw	Personally: Gentoo is how I taught myself Linux a decade ago, and I am heavily invested in the continuation of that learning. If it means I must dedicate more time to that goal (and indeed it seems to be the case), so be it.

2016-02-07 09:22:53	varainde1ian	I used (chroot) livecd linux # lsmod. If some modules have 0s in the "Used by" column, does it mean they are not in use? Does the livecd load all possible modules (other than those which my pc needs)?
2016-02-07 09:23:24	tdr	varainde1ian, no that column shows if other modules use them, not if your hardware does
2016-02-07 09:23:50	tdr	varainde1ian, livecds usually load tons of modules just in case you have that hardware, loaded modules doesn't mean any of them actually fit your hardware

2016-02-08 17:26:21	resist0r	e2fsck -c  causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program to do a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad blocks. If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory. If this option is specified twice, then the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.

2016-02-09 00:48:03	p_l	iamben: I suspect that if you live in GNOME/KDE and mostly use those it's fine. For development work, or dealing with hairy stuff, I found "install it all" indispensable
2016-02-09 00:48:45	Yatekii	so I did a repo.conf in /etc/portage/repos.conf/ . this is recognized properly but it tells me that it needs the masters = gentoo param ... but I consulted the wiki and it doesn't tell me that for external repos ... whoom to believe?
2016-02-09 00:49:39	bunder	i think the wiki needs updating, adding it works for me
2016-02-09 00:49:45	Yatekii	also, it tells me: WARNING: One or more repositories have missing repo_name entries: /usr/local/portage/overlay/datacore/profiles/repo_name
2016-02-09 00:49:57	Yatekii	but that's the location it should store the overlay.
2016-02-09 00:50:05	+grknight	Yatekii: if the overlay uses eclasses from the main gentoo tree, it needs a masters=gentoo entry
2016-02-09 00:50:06	Yatekii	so that's not in my hand to add that name file, right?
2016-02-09 00:50:15	Yatekii	oh, k
2016-02-09 00:50:26	+grknight	Yatekii: your "friend" should also name the repo like the warning suggests
2016-02-09 00:50:44	Yatekii	grknight: okay, ty!
2016-02-09 00:51:05	Yatekii	but i think that's just because I didn't sync yet
2016-02-09 00:51:09	Yatekii	needa read bout this :)
2016-02-09 00:51:10	Yatekii	ty!
2016-02-09 00:51:28	+iamben	p_l: that doesn't sound very gentoo-like.

2016-02-09 00:52:28	+iamben	look at the xorg-x11 ebuild, i bet there are at least a dozen apps you do not recognize
2016-02-09 00:52:39	+iamben	yet you want them installed, i guess
2016-02-09 00:53:02	bunder	iamben: didn't they strip most of those out?  i remember xclock being in there at one point, it's not now iirc

2016-02-09 01:02:59	bunder	sync should be fast if you've synced already, it only pulls a differential
2016-02-09 01:03:38	Yatekii	iamben: took me ~1min :D that is loooong :D well if I think about it: emerging itself is slow, so yeah that 1-2 mins don't matter :)

2016-02-09 01:04:27	R0b0t1`	wait, so if syncing is faster the more often you do it, he should sync every 5 minutes right?
2016-02-09 01:04:36	+iamben	if you do not sync often, it may be more efficient to use webrsync
2016-02-09 01:04:51	bunder	no, the main servers themselves sync every 15 minutes
2016-02-09 01:04:59	+iamben	R0b0t1`: well the more often you do it, the less data you need to transfer each time.  there is a guideline of once-per-day for public rsync mirrors.
2016-02-09 01:05:00	bunder	but i wouldn't go that low either, they'll block you
2016-02-09 01:05:03	R0b0t1`	^ also can be verified, but maybe git is well enough along to work too
2016-02-09 01:05:07	bunder	just go with daily
2016-02-09 01:05:12	+iamben	but you can switch to github and punish that mirror as much as you want =)

2016-02-09 01:35:52	R0b0t1`	for the first if you knew the PBKDF2 parameters it would be "just as easy" but this isn't used for SSH (or widely used, if it's an option... some strange things are options)

2016-02-09 01:38:00	bunder	yes but they still have to get the key first
2016-02-09 01:38:20	R0b0t1`	also they need to trial-decrypt the key for each password guess

2016-02-09 04:25:26	slabity	It's pretty common to use /boot/EFI if you're using a bootloader that can load your partition containing /boot
2016-02-09 04:26:17	grawity	slabity: are you sure it's /boot/EFI and not /boot/efi
2016-02-09 04:26:40	grawity	oh well nevermind

2016-02-09 04:38:30	m_ben	if /boot partition is encrypted, one needs to set GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y, then grub will ask for the passphrase *before* the grub menu, and a second time when booting the root partition. so it does work to have /boot encrypted, it's just annoying to type the passphrase twice

2016-02-09 06:13:11	resist0r	rsync is great because you can preserve permissions, symlinks, and even easily resume the sync if it is interrupted.  Additionally you can verify the data with checksum validation which in your case is probably not necessary and would not be worth the overhead/time-increase due to the fact your gonna rsync from one device to another in the same machine

2016-02-09 06:23:13	resist0r	it seems that if all you want is what you have working right now then dd is your prefered tool.  If you find that you would like to selectively sync some data or would like to still preserve hard links and additional filesystem information then be sure you have determined the correct flags to achieve your goal.  Knowing your goal is important because how else can you achieve it if you dont know it... as in, you may not know you need to preserv

If you can use tar to skip creating an intermediate file by streaming the data to stdout you should be able to grab that sdout and pipe it to the destination which seems to me to be much less overhead, proportionally faster

2016-02-09 07:41:13	flacks	Hi, I'm trying to boot Gentoo from a USB hard drive; when I change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX to "root=UUID=[UUID]" and run grub2-mkconfig, I'm still getting "root=/dev/sdb1" *before* the new "root=UUID" parameter in my grub.cfg. I've changed my fstab to UUID also, so I'm not sure what's causing "/dev/sdb1" to appear in boot.cfg. Any tips?

2016-02-09 07:42:13	+iamben	flacks: check CONFIG_CMDLINE
2016-02-09 07:42:22	BtbN	you can't use UUID based boot then, and grub knows that.
2016-02-09 07:42:42	+iamben	oh, right, grub is writing the root=/dev/sdb1 param, nm
2016-02-09 07:42:51	flacks	interesting
2016-02-09 07:43:02	BtbN	if you use an initrd, grub will generate UUID based entries automaticaly.

2016-02-09 10:54:40	wraeth	tranquility1: could be worthwhile commenting on that bug, too ;)
2016-02-09 10:55:15	artificial	flacks: really? Its taking me an hour in doing 'emerge -uDNav @world' and its still going
2016-02-09 10:55:48	deux3xmachina	did you change the MAKEOPTS in your make.conf?

2016-02-09 10:56:04	tranquility1	wraeth: Well I mean idk if they would want my input XD, the only thing I wish they didn't do was mask X and tools for nvidia-drivers. I had to edit my profile to allow it and make a new digest for nvidia-drivers-366-18-r4.ebuild since I updated the file to point to the fixed patch.

2016-02-09 10:57:12	wraeth	tranquility1: well masking those USE flags is just a result of using hardened - your override should hold while it's listed in /etc/portage/profile
2016-02-09 10:57:17	artificial	flacks: Im switching over to gentoo from Arch as well
2016-02-09 10:57:30	flacks	artificial: well, admittedly, this is *just* a base install; tuning the kernel, installing on a USB HDD to test on many systems, and i still haven't learned portage well. in due time :P
2016-02-09 10:57:30	wraeth	tranquility1: and you can make your fix to the ebuild persistent by hosting it in a local overlay instead of editing the in-tree ebuild

2016-02-09 10:59:20	artificial	flacks: I have
2016-02-09 10:59:29	wraeth	tranquility1: and your input on how you got around the failed patch could still be useful (provided there isn't anything relevant already on the bug - haven't looked, myself)
2016-02-09 11:00:07	tranquility1	wraeth: The patch was already fixed by the PAX group but the new data hasn't circulated through the portage tree yet.
2016-02-09 11:00:13	artificial	flacks: this is different though because of overlays and emerge, I just need to watch a video on gentoo and ill be good
2016-02-09 11:00:18	wraeth	tranquility1: aha fair enough :)

2016-02-09 11:01:27	wraeth	artificial: yes, it can take a little getting used to, being not only able but encouraged, to edit core system configuration files; but once you get the hang of it, it's a breeze. also, there's always here (and other topic-focussed channels), mailing lists and forums, too ;)
2016-02-09 11:01:43	deux3xmachina	artificial, flacks: with the Gentoo and Arch wiki's, it's pretty simple to get most things up and running. The hardest part is waiting for everything to build.

2016-02-09 11:07:19	wraeth	artificial: depends on how you do it - if you --deselect a package (removing it from world, indicating you don't explicitly want that package), then `emerge -ca` (depclean) it will remove any packages that aren't either selected or required for deps
2016-02-09 11:07:23	+grknight	flacks: because you specified a package.. that is a different mode than scanning the tree for orphans

2016-02-09 11:09:29	+grknight	flacks: there is somewhat of a benefit to this as you could be switching implementations.  in such a case it might have an hour long compile to get back because of a big dependency (like webkit-gtk for example)

2016-02-09 11:12:48	wraeth	nutzz: you're correct, it isn't, but occasionally people set it not realising what affect it has
2016-02-09 11:13:44	artificial	So what exactly is 'emerge -uDNav @world' anyway? I just know I need to do it after switching profiles

2016-02-09 13:13:11	wraeth	artificial: a painful thing about uefi is you need to have booted in uefi in order to add a new bootloader to the boot menu; and you're currently not in uefi mode. this just means that, if your firmware supports it, you might need to "select efi file to load" and browse to the grub binary, and if not, may have to use a different efi-capable boot medium to get into uefi mode in the first place

2016-02-09 13:42:28	+grknight	don't mix genkernel and manual builds.  partictularly if you use grub2-mkconfig.  it will pick the genkernel version over the manually built one and you are left scratching your head like "why did nothing change?"

2016-02-09 13:45:50	anket	I found some guidance to mount multiple loop devices through a single mount point, but it involves a RAID setup. The instructions involve losetup and mdadm. How can I mount multiple images without RAID?

2016-02-09 13:47:22	username234	anket: what do you mean by 'single mount point'?  What comes to mind when I hear that is mounting everything to the same dir.  Which you can do that, but only the last device would be visible

2016-02-09 13:48:04	bobbertson	do i need to configure bootloader or something?

2016-02-09 13:51:25	anket	username234: I have to mount an image, but it was in sections. The instructions I got show that I can use 'losetup /dev/loop1 image1.img' and 'losetup /dev/loop2 image2.img' to set up the images.

2016-02-09 14:58:54	Phoenix591	bobbertson: you can use the abi_x86_32 useflag
2016-02-09 14:59:00	kurly	bobbertson: when you install something in portage that needs it, it'll provide instructions how to proceed
2016-02-09 14:59:05	bobbertson	that will grab me both?

2016-02-09 15:20:05	bobbertson	i got it installed just fine, didnt even need to re run anything, just had to disable noveau and then rrecompile again
2016-02-09 15:20:11	bobbertson	everythings working great now
2016-02-09 15:20:19	flacks	artificial: and openrc. do yourself a favor. it's why i switched from arch.

2016-02-09 15:20:50	artificial	The main reason im still doing this and not going back to arch is because I want to rice my wm to a purple color scheme and the gentoo logo fits in nice
2016-02-09 15:21:05	Phoenix591	bobbertson: oh ?even have steam games running decently? because when I got nvidia isntalled steam was complaining about libgl

2016-02-09 15:21:40	bobbertson	pretty sure thats probably related to a missing 32 bit library though
2016-02-09 15:21:44	sunnymilk	theres a module for Ricon Bay1Controllers

2016-02-09 15:21:49	sunnymilk	but i dont think thats the one

2016-02-09 15:46:32	Phoenix591	bobbertson: yeah that really wierds me out how you wern't having trouble launching steam ocne you got nvidia-drivers installed... are you sure you've told the system to actually use their libGL (eselect opengl , just like with the kernel list and/or set)
2016-02-09 15:46:44	kurly	ozmage: that said, I have a test VM where the default compiler is clang, and only specific packages are built with gcc (which is still necessary, as stated above)

2016-02-09 15:53:15	bobbertson	so annoying
2016-02-09 15:53:17	sunnymilk	(fun fact: to replace the power jack, you need to take EVERYTHING out of the chassis, just so you can plug/unplug this dinky little power cord, its infuriating how much extra work you need to do than if they had just put the sock on top of the logic board...)
2016-02-09 15:53:35	flacks	sunnymilk: oh yeah, tell me about it. i ahve an X200 and found out the same

2016-02-09 15:53:51	sunnymilk	i did it once before and it sorta worked

2016-02-16 02:35:20	Ionic	looks like newer kernel versions don't have the DRM_I915_KMS symbol anymore and the option described in x11-drivers/xf86-video-intel is now obsolete
2016-02-16 02:35:40	+iamben	cnnx: mine is pretty similar to yours.  --binpkg-respect-use=y and --binpkg-changed-deps=y is not needed at all, but mine is missing --with-bdeps=y

2016-02-16 02:42:44	cnnx	and it should pull binaries
2016-02-16 02:42:45	+iamben	normally a changed dep on an installed pkg wouldnt trigger a rebuild but binpkgs are sensitive to that so that's why we added --changed-deps

2016-02-16 02:43:12	rypervenche	Anyone know why my Firefox (when watching Youtube HTML5 videos) completely crashes my laptop? It causes the last second of audio to loop infinitely and I have no access to the magic sysrq commands (guessing kernel panic?). I'm thinking maybe a Firefox or gstreamer update that may have done this? https://k.ryp.io/view/b0026717
2016-02-16 02:43:58	Ionic	iamben: changed dependencies SHOULD warrant a revbump, because the ebuild is copied to the environment file and used for operations like uninstalling the package
2016-02-16 02:44:21	varaindemian	iamben: at the end of the file? without ~amd64 at the end (=sys-auth/consolekit-1.0.1 ~amd64)?
2016-02-16 02:44:23	Ionic	hence without a revbump you'll end up in a desynchronized - and unreproducible - state
2016-02-16 02:44:30	+iamben	rypervenche: you probably want to disable gstreamer on firefox
2016-02-16 02:44:38	+iamben	Ionic: yes this is the great dynamic dependencies debate
2016-02-16 02:45:03	+iamben	varaindemian: anywhere in the file.  ~amd64 is optional, it's implied if you dont specify a keyword

2016-02-16 02:45:53	rypervenche	iamben: Oh, would that be the only solution? This was working before a specific update. Could be kernel, gst-plugins, or firefox, I think. It was working before and it works just fine in Chromium.
2016-02-16 02:46:30	+iamben	rypervenche: gstreamer support is on its way out.  ffmpeg is used directly now.  firefox-44 has support for both, but gst goes away in 45 (iirc)
2016-02-16 02:46:51	+iamben	you can also runtime-disable gst support somewhere in about:config

2016-02-16 05:02:43	rx80	cnnx: it's not static
2016-02-16 05:02:58	tdr	cnnx, try this just to see if its taking trident options at all:  video=tridentfb:800x600-16@75,noaccel
2016-02-16 05:03:14	tdr	cnnx, ^^ its an example from the doc for tridentfb

2016-02-16 05:04:53	cnnx	yes
2016-02-16 05:05:22	cnnx	317 worked

2016-02-16 05:05:49	cnnx	now, everytime i update my kernel with my script it overwrites grub.cfg

2016-02-16 05:09:06	tdr	iamben, good point, trident is accellerated and can access card memory, it may not like to share it
2016-02-16 05:09:35	tdr	i think he said the other day he was just going to keep that p3 in text mode tho
2016-02-16 05:09:52	cnnx	why wont it like X? if i want to use fluxbox
2016-02-16 05:10:17	tdr	cnnx, certain framebuffers claim video memory in a way that doesn't let X share it

2016-02-16 05:10:34	tdr	cnnx, no telling if trident plays nice or not
2016-02-16 05:10:36	cnnx	whats the solution
2016-02-16 05:10:36	+iamben	this is part of why modern drivers use kernel modesetting so the same driver handles the display of console AND X
2016-02-16 05:11:04	tdr	cnnx, just try it, and if trident doesn't work, revert back to vesa for fb, it does play nice with x11 drivers usually
2016-02-16 05:11:10	+iamben	you may be able to use vesafb for console and the trident drier for X, or you could use the tridentfb driver for console and a generic fbcon driver for X

2016-02-16 08:05:33	bazz__	Hi gentoo, I had problems emerging app-i18n/mozc with dev-libs/protobuf-2.5.0-r2 but after unmasking 2.6.1-r3 it emerged just fine.. However, =dev-libs/protobuf-2.6.1-r3 is not apparently a dependency of app-i18n/mozc .. I'm not sure if it was a personal malfunction or one that anybody else could also run into, but thought it worth mentioning - if someone could point me to the proper place to describe this
2016-02-16 08:05:40	bazz__	issue on record, I would appreciate it. Thanks

2016-02-16 08:59:22	+iamben	cnnx: i think 16bit will be "low enough" but i dont know the xorg.conf syntax for forcing that

2016-02-16 09:21:33	Guest84124	i installed a new kernel with make install. I restarted an now grub keeps rebooting the pc instead of letting me choose my os. help plz
2016-02-16 09:21:33	+iamben	but your current setup of xorg + xf86-video-trident looks good
2016-02-16 09:22:01	+iamben	Guest84124: this is a bit of a shot in the dark, but im guessing you ran out of space in /boot so grub is pointed at a truncated kernel file

Im getting a new laptop for work and I really like gentoo, but I don't know how obtrusive maintaining a source based distro will be for work. I'm sewhat new tl gentoo, only been on it for around a year
2016-02-16 12:39:52	+grknight	what downtime?
2016-02-16 12:40:12	wraeth	x40a0e: there's minimal downtime, and it's usually only if you've been messing around with things :)
2016-02-16 12:40:15	x40a0e	Breakage/package and lib upgrades
2016-02-16 12:40:21	 - 	dlan_ is now known as dlan
2016-02-16 12:40:30	+grknight	breakage? very rare
2016-02-16 12:40:35	wraeth	if you stay on stable, then there should be even less breakage
2016-02-16 12:41:25	wraeth	and less than "very rare" is "very rare indeed" ;)
2016-02-16 12:41:28	x40a0e	Fair enough. I am deciding between arch and gentoo, but (not to start any holy wars) i hate systemd

2016-02-16 12:42:34	+grknight	x40a0e: we are about choice.  the default is OpenRC, but you could use anything as the init system if you choose to (and do the work to write scripts for it)
2016-02-16 12:42:48	cnnx	grknight: is emerge packages with the -j flag faster? since there's no screen scrolling?
2016-02-16 12:43:03	x40a0e	Yeah thats a fair point, i always heard about that on arch, and i used it for 3 years or so only breaking shit once.
2016-02-16 12:43:29	wraeth	x40a0e: also, there would be no more breakage in gentoo than you would expect from arch, plus if there's software you're missing, you can very easily create an ebuild for it and presto you have your custom package managed by the package manager
2016-02-16 12:43:31	+grknight	cnnx: it can be if you have the resources since it does multiple packages when possible.  to just silence stuff, you can use --quiet-build=y
2016-02-16 12:43:45	x40a0e	grknight: yeah i really like that. A lot of distros ylreally have init baked in deep. Openrc is great
2016-02-16 12:43:57	cnnx	grknight: i4790k with 8 threads would be good for it?
2016-02-16 12:44:02	kurly	cnnx: if screen scrolling costs you a measurable amount of time, you should refrain from using a computer that is more than 20 years old ;)
2016-02-16 12:44:08	+grknight	cnnx: that's one piece yes
2016-02-16 12:44:14	cnnx	grknight: thansk ill ust it then
2016-02-16 12:44:25	x40a0e	wraeth: good point. Im used to the AUR, but ebuilds seem really elegant and easy to do.
2016-02-16 12:44:34	+grknight	x40a0e: you could use s6, runit, or something along those lines too
2016-02-16 12:44:54	*	grknight ran s6 as init for a while
2016-02-16 12:45:15	wraeth	x40a0e: they generally are, and even for more complex packages it's still reasonably straightforward
2016-02-16 12:45:30	wokko	Or even a little mouse in a wheel

I'm new to Gentoo and the concept of USE flags, and emerge fails to install i3, with the message "The following USE changes are necessary to proceed." I can paste the full output if anyone would like to see. I'm unsure which of these lines I need to add, and what file I need to add them to.

2016-02-16 15:46:01	trix`G	probably
2016-02-16 15:46:09	trix`G	and chopped up into peices
2016-02-16 15:46:13	rypervenche	Should check those before you reboot ~_^
2016-02-16 15:46:25	kurly	reboot comes last, unless you like pain
2016-02-16 15:46:34	trix`G	yeah well I was eager to see if it booted into the new video drivers (it didn't)
2016-02-16 15:46:53	trix`G	anyway pain time, going to try and fix everything
2016-02-16 15:47:49	trix`G	so I just hit 'eselect news read' and got nothing, now I feel less stupid
2016-02-16 15:48:36	trix`G	still stupid, as I didn't check, but less so, as checking would not have warned me of squat
2016-02-16 15:48:39	kurly	then you've previously read "2015-10-07  OpenRC-0.18 localmount and netmount changes"?
2016-02-16 15:49:25	trix`G	not that I recall, however this is my fifth attempt to upgrade this system so perhaps on a previous attempt I did and forgot

2016-02-16 15:51:42	kurly	anyway just for future reference, not doing the configs before your reboot can lead to a non-booting situation (or no network, in this case)
2016-02-16 15:52:01	kurly	it'd be nice if breaking changes weren't introduced at all, but they're usually documented in the news
2016-02-16 15:53:10	trix`G	the only config that needed updating was rc.conf and all it apparantly wanted to do was undo my settings to it
2016-02-16 15:53:35	trix`G	but yes you do make a good point, I will keep that in mind in the future
2016-02-16 15:53:35	kurly	the news item details fstab changes that cannot reasonably be automated

2016-02-17 02:24:02	GazJ82	Hi guys, when using portage and being asked if I want to auto write use flags to config files, is there anyway of specifying what file this gets added to.  It currently adds to the last file I created in /etc/portage/package.use

2016-02-17 03:26:41	+iamben	rhombus: you'll want to remove/undo that, or eix-sync will double sync all overlays... just remove /etc/eix-sync.conf (i think that's the location)

2016-02-17 03:28:33	fabrox	I'm wondering because i have no alsa installed
2016-02-17 03:28:36	rhombus	iamben: there does not seem to be an eix-sync.conf file -- would eix-sync also have respected PORTDIR?
2016-02-17 03:29:07	+iamben	fabrox: alsa is mostly a kernel feature, you will want to emerge alsa-utils if you want stuff like alsmixer, aplay, etc
2016-02-17 03:29:26	+grknight	rhombus: like many config files, if one does not exist, it uses defaults
2016-02-17 03:29:42	rdctrlzr	so when do I have to rebuild/reinstall my initramfs? everytime I changed kernel?
2016-02-17 03:29:50	+iamben	rhombus: if you dont have any eix-sync.conf anywhere then i dont know how eix-sync would have been syncing layman overlays (from old layman)
2016-02-17 03:29:58	fabrox	iamben: Do i need alsa-utils even if i'm on KDE Plasma?
2016-02-17 03:29:58	+iamben	rdctrlzr: depends on what's in the initramfs

2016-02-17 03:30:31	+iamben	rdctrlzr: if you built it via genkernel, it has kernel modules inside, most likely

2016-02-17 03:54:55	rhombus	iamben: yes

2016-02-17 03:56:20	fearedbliss	the only way it wont have a remote is if you manually create a non-bare git folder and you never upload it anywhere
2016-02-17 03:56:29	+iamben	rhombus: well isn't that what you want, for a local overlay? nothing on sync
2016-02-17 03:56:31	rhombus	fearedbliss: but why do I need to clone a repo that I only have locally in the first place?
2016-02-17 03:56:49	rhombus	iamben: ok, fair enough
2016-02-17 03:56:56	fearedbliss	rhombus: because you are trying to "sync" a target location through portage?
2016-02-17 03:57:13	rhombus	iamben: the old behaviour was that eix-sync would update the eix database at the end of the sync procedure

2016-02-17 08:14:29	Sembiance	iamben: hrm, odd. an `emerge --sync` isn't pulling it down. It did pull down the 2.21-r2 patch, but not the 2.22-r2 version.

2016-02-17 08:58:02	+iamben	too bad the commit messages dont explain what's fixed..
2016-02-17 08:58:21	+K_F	iamben: its described in the various bug reports
2016-02-17 08:58:35	kerframil	iamben: I noticed that ... reminds me of spender's (of grsec fame) numerous complaints regarding such practices
2016-02-17 08:58:42	Korhonen	kerframil, so do I need to reload all the daemons and stuff for the patch to take effect?
2016-02-17 08:58:43	+K_F	see e.g comment 2 in bug 572416
2016-02-17 08:58:45	willikins	K_F: https://bugs.gentoo.org/572416 "<sys-libs/glibc-2.22-r2: multiple vulnerabilities"; Gentoo Security, Vulnerabilities; IN_P; ago:security
2016-02-17 08:58:52	Korhonen	I take it that glibc only updates when re-linked at startup?
2016-02-17 08:59:08	+iamben	K_F: that's no excuse
2016-02-17 08:59:23	kerframil	Korhonen: I'm afraid you'll need to do exactly taht
2016-02-17 08:59:32	kerframil	Korhonen: a reboot is the best bet, if that is permissible in your environment
2016-02-17 08:59:37	Korhonen	kerframil, yeah, I guess a full reboot is just the safest way?
2016-02-17 08:59:39	kerframil	Korhonen: if you can't, install lib_users and restart as much as you can
2016-02-17 08:59:41	Korhonen	Yeah
2016-02-17 08:59:53	Korhonen	This is why I neurotically tend to keep my boot times under 500ms.
2016-02-17 09:00:01	javaJake	Is checkrestart good at checking for out-of-date libraries in memory?
2016-02-17 09:00:06	Korhonen	Well no, actually it's just eing completely neurotic.
2016-02-17 09:00:23	javaJake	I've used that to see what exactly requires restarting, so I can avoid rebooting.
2016-02-17 09:00:26	kerframil	Korhonen: in my case, the hardware is the bottleneck where boot times are concerned

2016-02-17 10:15:24	tdr	cnnx, ssh supports displaying applications through it, no need to for the desktop if you dont need that
2016-02-17 10:15:28	cnnx	like ia X11 forwarding?

2016-02-17 10:17:05	cnnx	and just forwards the application
2016-02-17 10:17:29	cnnx	connect with ssh -X if i remember
2016-02-17 10:17:52	tdr	cnnx, it does, but i think you may need a server on the other end too, maybe just the backend libs (i work too much with redhat junk and some things could be specific to RH)
2016-02-17 10:18:06	tdr	cnnx, or ssh -Y  (trusted and quicker forwarding)

2016-02-17 14:28:02	rypervenche	_genuser_: Being able to send packets and receive packets are two completely different things in the firewall world.
2016-02-17 14:28:02	kerframil	_genuser_: and, if you're relying on nat or port forwarding, the probable reason is that that aspect was ballsed up. but let's see.

2016-02-17 14:28:45	Coburn	sometimes wifi can have isolation mode on

2016-02-17 15:45:53	nanovad	I believe knotify4 shows popup notifications and manages those shown in KDE's notification bar
2016-02-17 15:46:06	froller	apparently dhcpcd-ui also has a gtk version if that is your cup of tea
2016-02-17 15:46:49	phredus	froller: when i google knotify i find https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/kde-apps/knotify but there is no description of what it does.  do you know where I can go and look up all these pieces and find an explanation of what they do?
2016-02-17 15:47:07	froller	i personally just google around

2016-02-17 15:49:55	froller	i've had -gtk in my make.conf forever because sometimes programs have a gtk flag meaning that they want a gui
2016-02-17 15:50:05	phredus	froller: That sounds good, I'm pretty new to gentoo actually not so its just there is so much to learn
2016-02-17 15:50:27	froller	so instead of curses ui, gtk use flag builds the thing with a gtk gui
2016-02-17 15:50:47	phredus	ok so -gtk woud not create gui for those programs where you dont need it

2016-02-17 18:56:15	bitlord	varaindemian, also you can try to look into /proc/asound  (like this one from my system   /proc/asound/card0/codec#0  )

I cant remember how to configure it to lounch from the chroot anymore. and I searched for quite some time now... no sucess. so how can I successfully run `/etc/init.d/distccd start` from the chroot?
2016-02-18 10:59:05	ali_	wokko: Tried uncommenting that line (and commented other one) but didn't work. Looks strange

2016-02-18 13:03:56	stqn	phantomcircuit: and yes (as per the topic) is includes the fix

2016-02-18 14:00:25	lanodan	Or also man ebuild if you’re offline
2016-02-18 14:00:25	tomboy64	usually you do it somewhere between 80 and 100 chars

2016-02-18 14:02:53	bobbertson	in my text editor it shows up like they are all aligned vertically
2016-02-18 14:03:09	bobbertson	should i only keep 1 tab

2016-02-18 14:03:33	bobbertson	having it alligned with the other flags looks bad though
2016-02-18 14:03:43	bobbertson	nevermind would look best with 2 tabs

2016-02-18 14:05:24	bobbertson	it is ambiguous
2016-02-18 14:05:34	tomboy64	i think 5000 years of a LOT of chinese would disagree with that as well
2016-02-18 14:05:56	bobbertson	you probably know about it more than me so if you think most people would agree that way i will put it in there too

2016-02-19 00:27:07	Kelsar	BadPractice: is is a cable company?
2016-02-19 00:28:10	BadPractice	Kelsar: my isp is http://www.upc.at/
2016-02-19 00:28:44	BadPractice	Kelsar: you know how i can find out if they block port 80?
2016-02-19 00:28:49	[Enrico]	BadPractice, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT
2016-02-19 00:29:02	[Enrico]	you have to research to discover if that's the case
2016-02-19 00:29:04	Kelsar	so, yes it is via tv cable. You most probably don't have an own IP. You share it with many other people
2016-02-19 00:29:30	[Enrico]	if you are behind a carrier grade NAT you are in trouble. Usually you have to change ISP (or pay more to have yourself un-NATed)
2016-02-19 00:29:30		[00:29]
2016-02-19 00:29:31	Kelsar	yes, UPC does Dual Stack Lite
2016-02-19 00:29:52	Kelsar	like most european cable companys they probably don't have enough IPv4

2016-02-19 03:21:50	russoisraeli	hello folks. Good time of day. I have more of Linux general question. I have two boxes with lots of RAM available, and by lots I mean one has 64G, the other 128G. Though the applications running on the box barely consume a third of that, including buffers/cache, the boxes often start going into swap, and using several gigabytes of swap. Is there something I am missing? Many thanks

2016-02-19 03:28:40	russoisraeli	yeah, that's what I thought per what I know... that if there's enough RAM available - swap is used for unneeded items
2016-02-19 03:29:52	russoisraeli	I guess I'll try to adjust swappiness (set to 60)
2016-02-19 03:29:56	+iamben	some stuff getting pushed to swap so the available memory can be used for caching, is generally ok/good, but it seems odd you'd dip several gigabytes into swap when you have 64GB
2016-02-19 03:30:07	russoisraeli	and maybe just remove swap space

2016-02-19 03:32:09	S0rin	On production server 60 is low because disk even ssd still slower than ram for caching thing like databases

2016-02-19 10:06:43	bobbertson	i got a key and stuff now
2016-02-19 10:06:53	tomboy64	bobbertson: indeed. git-syncing is also faster - you still have to manually recreate md5sums, though
2016-02-19 10:06:59	bobbertson	i have the key as PORTAGE_GPG_KEY in make.conf
2016-02-19 10:07:03	tomboy64	good boy :)
2016-02-19 10:07:06	shields	I installed gentoo via the russian built "calculate linux", it is gentoo with a calculate layer that you can remove if you want
2016-02-19 10:07:12	tomboy64	what do you need me for then?
2016-02-19 10:07:13	blackie_	How well would you actually have to know the different build routines? I mean... it is easy to run make/cmake when someone else has set up the makefile etc... or would it be a "learn as you go" thing?
2016-02-19 10:07:23	bobbertson	how do i push my change to the actual gentoo repo
2016-02-19 10:07:25	bobbertson	so others get it
2016-02-19 10:07:25	tomboy64	shields: what docs did you use?
2016-02-19 10:07:37	tomboy64	bobbertson: gimme a link to your repo please

2016-02-19 10:08:28	rypervenche	blackie_: You don't really see any of that. From a user perspective it looks just like an other package manager when it installs packages (with the quiet build option enabled that is)
2016-02-19 10:08:40	stqn	blackie_: if you’re still talking about maintaining gentoo, you don’t do that at all, except for the kernel if you want to
2016-02-19 10:08:46	stakewinner00	thanks, another little question. The profiles of gentoo are only "monolithic"?

2016-02-19 10:09:26	bobbertson	sure
2016-02-19 10:09:29	tomboy64	stakewinner00: define "monolithic"
2016-02-19 10:09:53	tomboy64	bobbertson: on the left, select your Branch
2016-02-19 10:10:10	bobbertson	wait you mean a diff in github
2016-02-19 10:10:12	bobbertson	how do i do that
2016-02-19 10:10:19	rypervenche	blackie_: Gentoo is quite automated. All of the ebuild (like pkgbuild files) handle all of the configurations so you don't need to worry about any of that.
2016-02-19 10:10:19	blackie_	rypervenche stqn: oh ok I see. then it shouldn't be a problem. thank you..
2016-02-19 10:10:47	tomboy64	bobbertson: there you see "bobbertson media-fonts .... Latest commit 88605b6 19 hours ago" on one line. click anywhere on that, so you can see the diff of your commit
2016-02-19 10:10:47		[10:10]
2016-02-19 10:11:06	bobbertson	ok
2016-02-19 10:11:25	tomboy64	bobbertson: now it's all red and green for your changes
2016-02-19 10:11:32	bobbertson	right
2016-02-19 10:11:35	stakewinner00	tomboy64, a picture explains better than my english :) http://gutl.jovenclub.cu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Funtoo_Gentoo_perfiles.jpg in funtoo you have mix-ins/flavor/branch/build, etc
2016-02-19 10:11:41	blackie_	rypervenche: ah alright. I guess you start tweaking the configurations after you've gotten to know ur system.. to avoid installing deps etc that you dont need
2016-02-19 10:12:12	tomboy64	bobbertson: and on the top right you see the full sha1 hash of your commit. git usually uses a 6 "digit" abbreviation. those digits are 0-9a-f, since they are hexadecimal.
2016-02-19 10:12:17	tomboy64	bobbertson: comprehensible?

2016-02-19 10:12:38	bobbertson	yes
2016-02-19 10:12:52	tomboy64	bobbertson: any question to that view?
2016-02-19 10:12:54	bobbertson	you mean 7 digit
2016-02-19 10:12:56	rypervenche	blackie_: Dependencies are handled very well in Gentoo. You have a file that keeps track of all of the packages that you've explicitly installed. The rest get installed as they are needed. If a dependency isn't needed anymore, it will get removed the next time you run a command to clean up dependencies (usually run after and update).
2016-02-19 10:12:57	bobbertson	no
2016-02-19 10:13:17	tomboy64	bobbertson: how many digits git needs to make it a unique representation :p

I bought a new laptop a month ago and it was pretty troublesome to get everything up and running smoothly in arch (still using a usb wifi adapter since there's no working driver for my internal wlan yet).. not to mention the gfx that is powered by nvidia optimus... anything to worry about here? i guess the community is big enough to make the selection of drivers pretty big

2016-02-19 10:37:24	Q-Chymera	 an equivalent from the app-admin/glance package - but maybe there's an easier, more gentooish way to do it anyway? I know how to make a stage4 tarball from my system, but I have no idea if that can then be turned into an openstack image

2016-02-19 10:53:32	Tipping_Fedora	i'm at about 1.4-5 hours so far
2016-02-19 10:53:35	chron0	blackie_: depends on your skill and what kind of setup you are trying to achieve in the end
2016-02-19 10:53:36	Tipping_Fedora	intel i5
2016-02-19 10:53:59	rypervenche	blackie_: Maybe a full day with full Xorg.
2016-02-19 10:54:12	chron0	nah, not compile time
2016-02-19 10:55:09	rypervenche	I set up my work machine, let it compile over night and I had a minimal i3 installation in the morning. But for a new user, maybe a two days or more.
2016-02-19 10:55:25	chron0	on a x230 thinkpad i7 I'm usually done (compiling) in less than half a day, biggest are libreoffice, chromium and boost by far
2016-02-19 10:55:31	rypervenche	And this machine is crap, mind you. If you install a desktop environment, it will take longer.

2016-02-19 10:56:16	blackie_	ok then I got a rough idea :) i will run bspwm which is also lite so that will shave off some time i guess
2016-02-19 10:56:21	chron0	try xfce
2016-02-19 10:56:31	rypervenche	The first installation takes the longest. After that it's smooth sailing.

2016-02-19 11:20:56	Q-Chymera	 an equivalent from the app-admin/glance package - but maybe there's an easier, more gentooish way to do it anyway? I know how to make a stage4 tarball from my system, but I have no idea if that can then be turned into an openstack image

2016-02-19 12:37:02	+grknight	that's make jobs.. but emerge itself can parallize packages
2016-02-19 12:37:13	Tipping_Fedora	hmm
2016-02-19 12:37:18	Tipping_Fedora	whats the difference?
2016-02-19 12:37:35	+grknight	make is within a single build

2016-02-19 13:01:49	kerframil	dan999: one thing to be aware of is that, if USE="symlink" is in effect, the symlink always gets updated to whichever new sources are installed. so, if that's on, you would likely want to turn it off unless you always upgrade like clockwork.
2016-02-19 13:01:53	+grknight	Tipping_Fedora: yes
2016-02-19 13:01:54	dan999	then I need to reboot?

2016-02-19 13:02:07	Tipping_Fedora	grknight: is it in a repo of some kind?
2016-02-19 13:02:11	kerframil	dan999: because you have neither built, nor intend to run a new kernel at this time
2016-02-19 13:02:19	+grknight	Tipping_Fedora: it's in the main tree
2016-02-19 13:02:25	Tipping_Fedora	cool
2016-02-19 13:02:26	kerframil	dan999: you have simply updated the symlink to point to your last set of sources that were built

2016-02-19 13:03:20	dan999	ok, then at this point I need to do what?
2016-02-19 13:03:26	mingdao	Tipping_Fedora: also install pfl

2016-02-19 13:09:11	kerframil	dan999: I don't know what is causing your xorg not to work. I can simply tell you, based on what you pasted, that the nvidia-drivers ebuild bailed out because /usr/src/linux wasn't pointing to the right set of sources. as that has now been rectified, you may resume whatever you were doing (which included re-installing nvidia-drivers).

2016-02-19 13:26:03	kerframil	no, really. if you honestly want to do that, I won't stand in your way!
2016-02-19 13:26:31	kerframil	he just wants his xorg back up and running and who can blame him
2016-02-19 13:26:43	Tipping_Fedora	speaking of kernal, if I messed mine up during compile(forgetting to select somthing) can I go back and redo it with out doing an entire system reinstall?
2016-02-19 13:27:14	mingdao	leopold75: looks that way from p6 of the manual, also
2016-02-19 13:27:42	Tipping_Fedora	anyone?
2016-02-19 13:27:48	kerframil	Tipping_Fedora: yes. however, depending on the scope of your changes, it may change the bzImage file, entailing a reboot.
2016-02-19 13:27:52	mingdao	leopold75: Multi-VGA output support: D-Sub, DVI, HDMI ports
2016-02-19 13:28:00	Tipping_Fedora	i'd be cool with that

2016-02-19 13:28:17	kerframil	Tipping_Fedora: if in doubt, you need to go through the make; make modules_install; make install dance again, then reboot

2016-02-19 13:28:45	Tipping_Fedora	as well as my typos...
2016-02-19 13:28:57	kerframil	Tipping_Fedora: also, if you symlink /boot/vmlinuz to whatever your kernel image file is called, the next make install always updates the vmlinuz symlink
2016-02-19 13:29:09	Tipping_Fedora	cool
2016-02-19 13:29:14	kerframil	Tipping_Fedora: so, you can reference /boot/vmlinuz in a grub entry and know it boots the last installed kernel

2016-02-19 14:26:48	kerframil	rypervenche: it just occurred to me that these sources may have actually been 'uninstalled' (in pratice, portage never cleanly uninstalls)
2016-02-19 14:27:04	kurly	that's pretty misstated
2016-02-19 14:27:08	kerframil	dan999: scatch the above for 1 sec. can you run: wgetpaste -c 'ls /var/db/pkg/sys-kernel'
2016-02-19 14:27:22	kurly	portage cleanly uninstalls every file it installed; that's its job

2016-02-19 14:28:56	kurly	I... what?
2016-02-19 14:31:35	kerframil	sources are built by the user, so depcleaned or explicitly unmerged sources always leave a directory present, containing what might - to the uninitiated - appear to be a set of sources but is not. thus, leading to potential confusion to novices and the experienced alike.

2016-02-19 14:36:07	kerframil	dan999: what happened is that the 3.18 sources were actually uninstalled by portage at some earlier time. but remnants reamin, so the top-level directory still remains under /usr/src.
2016-02-19 14:36:49	kerframil	dan999: you can install them again if you like (still the easier option), or build the newer set of sources (the option 2 mentioned earlier)

2016-02-20 03:42:02	zeq	“Nouveau” [nuvo] is the French word for “new”. Nouveau is composed of a Linux kernel KMS driver (nouveau), Gallium3D drivers in Mesa, and the Xorg DDX (xf86-video-nouveau).
2016-02-20 03:42:31	+grknight	zeq: the code is newer than the wiki.. just like they dropped support for Maxwell cards for the time being

2016-02-20 05:20:25	leopold75	let me ask, why this magic works, and separately - no?

2016-02-20 05:21:12	Guest82356	grawity: the example should have been sudo -- 'ls -la /root > ...' if you catch the drift

2016-02-20 07:26:43	Scriptonaut	wait, no voice?
2016-02-20 07:26:46	Scriptonaut	then what's the point?
2016-02-20 07:26:48	GreatEmerald	Nope, text only
2016-02-20 07:26:55	Scriptonaut	well, I need voice, so I'm stuck with skype?

2016-02-20 07:34:55	Tipping_Fedora	I believe it does

2016-02-20 08:35:23	latenite	Hi folks, why does the dolphin automounter not mount a ESP while mounting all other partitions on the pen drive?
2016-02-20 08:36:37	GreatEmerald	iamben: Huh, that sounds more like stage4 being stage3 and stage3 becoming stage2 (or something, I don't know what stage2 is supposed to be)
2016-02-20 08:37:18	+iamben	GreatEmerald: stage3 is always just a fully built @system + deps, this new effort would just help to get @system back to what it truly shoudl be

2016-02-20 10:12:10	rypervenche	I would also recommend adding support in your kernel for /proc/config.gz. If you ever delete your .config by accident, you can get it from the running kernel at /proc/config.gz.
2016-02-20 10:12:43	rypervenche	Tipping_Fedora: There are a few ways to do that. I would keep a few kernels though, for when you bork your current kernel.

2016-02-20 16:17:41	kerframil	ok, I think I know what is happening here
2016-02-20 16:18:14	kerframil	the problem you have is that both the size and mtime are identical. therefore, rsync thinks that nothing must be done.
2016-02-20 16:18:41	kerframil	I don't know of any way around that other than to make it compute the checksums, which comes with a performance cost i.e. try -avzc
2016-02-20 16:19:18	kerframil	granted, they're not quite identical but it's quite possible that rsync doesn't recognise microsecond resolution

2016-02-20 16:23:58	kerframil	Kurogane: if it doesn't update with -c then they must already be the same! either that or you have a checksum collision.

2016-02-20 17:19:33	kerframil	if so, it could still be the problem i.e. you update mtime within a 1 second window
2016-02-20 17:20:27	kerframil	maybe rsync is fine with nansecond granularity using ext4
2016-02-20 17:21:20	Kurogane	yes i confirming, i check other box have ext4 and have 256

2016-02-20 17:23:52	kerframil	the question is whether the node size differs between both boxes
2016-02-20 17:24:09	kerframil	that's why I started by asking whether *both* have an inode size of 128 bytes
2016-02-20 17:25:27	kerframil	if you have 128 bytes on one side and 256 on the other, that means one supports nansecond resolution and the other does not

2016-02-20 17:25:49	kerframil	if you have 256 on both sides, then the filesystem should not be an issue
2016-02-20 17:26:15	kerframil	if you have 128 on both sides, that could also cause a problem with < 1 second updates
2016-02-20 17:26:58	kerframil	tldr: the best thing is to use ext4 on both sides, if you can

2016-02-20 17:28:28	Kurogane	kerframil, i tell you four times, both have 128.
2016-02-20 17:29:10	kerframil	no. you said "yes, ext4 have 256". then you said "yes ... other box have ext4 and have 256" which is in direct contradiction to the statement "both have 128"
2016-02-20 17:29:28	kerframil	you can't have "other box have ext4" and "both have 128"
2016-02-20 17:29:30	kerframil	it's impossible
2016-02-20 17:29:50	kerframil	anyway, whatever. all the possible causes have been discussed now.

2016-02-20 17:31:57	Kurogane	i told you i have many servers so i check the server have ext4 and show me i have 256 bytes, that is confirm the boxes have issue and not display fs is ext3

2016-02-20 17:33:29	kerframil	ok, probably a language barrier here. suffice to say, 256 bytes == ext4, which I think you know. 128 bytes == ext3, and is limited to 1 second granularity.
2016-02-20 17:33:51	kerframil	could affect the calculation in rsync

2016-02-20 19:52:59	kurly	your paste earlier had two problems: first, it was truncated (missing the top).  second, it was the result of mixing ~arch and arch.
2016-02-20 19:53:14	kurly	do less or more mixing
2016-02-20 19:54:51	CMEPTb	i'm happy with xfce... but i hear you can now get kde w/o systemd? is this really true?

2016-02-20 19:56:12	kurly	gnome is not news, kde is
2016-02-20 19:56:43	CMEPTb	hm almost want to try plasma now. sounds cute.

2016-02-20 19:57:21	kurly	korain: my answer is gonna remain unchanged; you mix ~arch and arch, you get to pick up the pieces :)

2016-02-20 20:06:37	nabblet	i was hit by that strange "hostname changed by networkmanager" thing and it puzzled me for some time. But I see I'm not alone, since there are so many hits on this isses on google now and arch and gentoo wiki discuss it too

2016-02-20 22:12:47	ashmew2	rokototou: actually, I want to build newlib and this newlib has parts of FASM that need the assembler.
2016-02-20 22:13:02	ashmew2	rokototou: I don't think FASM can replace GCC. They target different things.

2016-02-20 23:03:32	zeq	It will be a while before all the OSS drivers are there.  Even the proprietary Crimson/Catalyst AMD driver doesn't yet support Vulkan on Linux.

2016-02-20 23:04:14	zeq	Steam is pushing it hard, so expect things to happen.
2016-02-20 23:04:29	ashmew2	zeq: yeah, Valve is influential.
2016-02-20 23:04:44	ashmew2	zeq: What about Vulkan with nouveau?
2016-02-20 23:05:02	ashmew2	I use nouveau with Intel and PRIME to do hybrid graphics on my end.
2016-02-20 23:05:23	zeq	The Gallium3D drivers haven't been adapted yet.  Discussion is ongoinig on mesa-dev about the way forward.
2016-02-20 23:05:38	rokototou	zeq: then we can expect that game devs won't do vulkan bridge into games to make us buy cards...
2016-02-20 23:05:44	zeq	ashmew2: which Intel?
2016-02-20 23:06:27	rokototou	zeq: anyway i have hardened gen2 so i can't install proprietary nvidia driver
2016-02-20 23:06:32	zeq	Ivy Bridge and later will support Vulkan.  Ivy Bridge is currently only "experimental", ie it's broken at the moment!
2016-02-20 23:06:45	ashmew2	zeq: 2.99.917_p20160203 Intel driver version with mesa 11.1.1

2016-02-20 23:06:59	zeq	ashmew2: I mean which gen Intel

2016-02-20 23:07:28	rokototou	ashmew2 isn't PRIME the utility to check cpu power?

2016-02-20 23:07:56	ashmew2	rokototou: I'm afraid not. I use PRIME to switch between NVIDIA / nouveau and Intel graphics
2016-02-20 23:08:24	zeq	PRIME is the Xorg/Mesa hybrid graphics system.  Where you can pipe the output from one GPU to display on anothers display.
2016-02-20 23:08:44	ashmew2	Yeah, I don't need to use xrandr with DRI3 anymore
2016-02-20 23:08:56	ashmew2	and DRI3 is the only one that works for me. Otherwise I get kernel OOPS.
2016-02-20 23:09:24	zeq	PRIME is very cool, but currently requires you to be using ALL mesa GL

2016-02-21 05:39:00	GreatEmerald	zeq: The problem with spidermonkey is just that polkit requires some old version of it. Just using a different polkit ebould should do the trick

2016-02-21 05:49:24	steve555	Hi all, I've recently installed gentoo onto a spare hardrive with uefi. I have a KDE desktop and I have been adjusting my use flags in package.use. However running "emerge --ask --changed-use --deep @world" has come up with conflicts now. Here is the output:  : https://bpaste.net/show/39cfeb21295f

2016-02-21 05:50:01	GreatEmerald	grknight: Hm, I guess... Still would need to use --params for cache sizes, though, no way to divine that out of nothing but march
2016-02-21 05:50:05	steve555	I've used package.mask and also make.conf, but I can't seem to resolve the conflict

2016-02-21 05:55:20	parazyd	they aren't documented on packages.gentoo.org
2016-02-21 05:55:26	+grknight	the reason to not use native is for 1) the optimizaions are wrong and SIGILL starts popping up everywhere; 2) when using distcc - distcc will distribute -march to another machine and optimize for the other machine

2016-02-21 05:58:26	+grknight	Guest54677: sort of doubt that.  gcc can build for anything on any machine.. but when you go to use something, it just SIGILLs
2016-02-21 06:01:11	Guest54677	grknight: I could see that happening, i.e. when generating code for a machine not needing nops at some place, but running that on one that needs them for correct data path ordering
2016-02-21 06:01:33	Guest54677	s/i.e./e.g.,/
2016-02-21 06:02:12	+grknight	Guest54677: the build flags control everything.  how else could you cross compile.. even say PPC on x86_64?

2016-02-21 06:04:08	Guest54677	grknight: yes, my point is merely that selecting "incorrect" build flags (for the target machine) can lead to problems such as crashes due to illegal instructions for not-implemented opcodes or even incorrect execution, which is arguably worse because it doesn't need to manifest as a crash
2016-02-21 06:04:31	zeq	grknight: gcc isn't going to target the wrong march with native.  It *may* be vaguely possible if you use gcc dev snapshots, but even then I'd likely never happen.
2016-02-21 06:04:58	+grknight	zeq: it will if you run distcc to a remote with a different processor
2016-02-21 06:05:17	zeq	yes, then it will - but that's a special case
2016-02-21 06:05:53	zeq	and as GreatEmerald says, you can ask gcc what it would use with native and use that, with cache-line sizes et al
2016-02-21 06:06:02	+grknight	zeq: and sometimes new processors have bad detections.  we see it here occassionally until gcc catches up

2016-02-21 06:07:52	+grknight	i'm saying -march=native picks the wrong options even if you rebuild it.  somewhat rare, but it does happen

2016-02-21 09:32:30	leeyaa	is it normal for server to slowly start swapping while disk cache is used ?

2016-02-21 09:35:30	kerframil	leeyaa: a small amount of swap usage is nothing to worry about. a high rate of paging to and from swap is (which is not happening in your case).
2016-02-21 09:35:57	steve555	GreatEmerald: ok what is the best way of setting it up correctly?
2016-02-21 09:36:07	leeyaa	kerframil: yeah i know but i would like to understand why it happens only during imports
2016-02-21 09:36:14	leeyaa	i can see it uses a lot of disk cache
2016-02-21 09:36:28	Tipping_Fedora	hey, what do I need to do in my kernel to support usb3?
2016-02-21 09:36:46	kerframil	leeyaa: probably because the VM decides that those 90MB worth of pages are dormant and that it's 90MB that would be better spent on page cache or something else

2016-02-21 09:39:38	kerframil	leeyaa: where it becomes a bottleneck is if there is so much pressure that the rate - and cost - of swapping out and subsequent reclaim becomes high. that's an indicator that more RAM is required but you're nowhere near that point.

2016-02-21 09:40:13	kerframil	leeyaa: high memory pressure also starves pagecache which, in itself, is a performance killer (albeit not directly for InnoDB, which maintains its own cache)
2016-02-21 09:40:17	GreatEmerald	steve555: It should be zero config. It just reads all the available sessions and lets you choose one. I'm guessing something's wrong with your kde
2016-02-21 09:40:51	steve555	GreatEmerald: I think there could be.

2016-02-21 09:44:04	leeyaa	hm i guess ill get rid of swap graphs then and monitor swap in/out instead

2016-02-21 09:44:52	kerframil	leeyaa: a graph showing the split between anonymously mapped (application used), buffers, pagecache is also very helpful
2016-02-21 09:45:00	propyless	so anyone know how to --depclean sets?
2016-02-21 09:45:25	kerframil	leeyaa: if your workload became (too) heavy, you'd see pagecache shrink precipitously downward. very useful thing to graph.
2016-02-21 09:45:25		[09:45]
2016-02-21 09:45:54	kerframil	leeyaa: mind you, if it's a dedicated MySQL server, and you're using InnoDB, pagecache isn't overly important for what MySQL is doing

2016-02-21 09:46:06	leeyaa	kerframil: yeah sounds about right - if there is no pagecache performance will go down
2016-02-21 09:46:08	kerframil	leeyaa: that's because InnoDB caches its own pages in the buffer pool
2016-02-21 09:46:19	kerframil	leeyaa: and the buffer pool is managed directly by MySQL
2016-02-21 09:46:38	HeBD	GreatEmerald: try /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2016-02-21 09:46:39	leeyaa	kerframil: that particular server is mysql innodb, but im doing performance tests for a different app and your feedback is very useful

2016-02-21 09:58:33	Kelsar	Tipping_Fedora_: go back to your kernel configuration step and enable that module and build+install the new kernel
2016-02-21 09:58:41	Tipping_Fedora_	ok
2016-02-21 09:58:49	Tipping_Fedora_	can I do a /fuse to find it?

2016-02-21 09:59:03	Tipping_Fedora_	cool, thanks for the help
2016-02-21 10:00:06	Tipping_Fedora_	wait, can I just enable NTFS support in the kernel? or will that have write support?

2016-02-21 10:00:22	Tipping_Fedora_	ok

2016-02-21 11:53:43	leopold75	why my genkernel-next compile kernel drivers with generic x86_x64?? J just added in make.conf CFLAGS \ CXXFLAGS "-march=native -pipe -O2"
2016-02-21 11:53:53	leopold75	what need to fix?
2016-02-21 11:54:51	shields-	make menuconfig?
2016-02-21 11:54:54	+grknight	leopold75: the kernel does not source make.conf.  it's CFLAGS are set by the CPU type

2016-02-21 12:05:11	kerframil	leopold75: you definitely do not want to be in a position to pass a a custom string of flags to the kernel build system. the kernel is highly sensitive to effects on code generation.

2016-02-21 12:06:26	kerframil	if you haven't used that patch before, you'll notice that it adds many more options in the relevant section

2016-02-22 10:01:17	zeq	_genuser_: when is it even getting built?
2016-02-22 10:01:23	GreatEmerald	_genuser_: Yeap, they're the same thing, md5sums match
2016-02-22 10:02:00	GreatEmerald	_genuser_: In fact the x86_64 one is a symlink
2016-02-22 10:02:05	_genuser_	GreatEmerald: theyir md5sum is the same
2016-02-22 10:02:21	_genuser_	zeq: I don't know, that's why I'm asking.
2016-02-22 10:02:28	zeq	as I said the kernel calls x86-64 x86 as of a few years ago.  They merged the architectures and made each a variant
2016-02-22 10:02:49	*	GreatEmerald slaps _genuser_ around a bit with a large trout for missing the fact that it's a symlink
2016-02-22 10:02:51	_genuser_	ok, so if 64-bit is enabled then the x86/boot/bzImge is fine.
2016-02-22 10:03:03	zeq	exactly
2016-02-22 10:03:09	_genuser_	GreatEmerald: heh, I'm more concerned after a make with the fact that I hope it will boot.
2016-02-22 10:03:13	_genuser_	because I have kernel panics.
2016-02-22 10:03:16	_genuser_	zeq: nice!
2016-02-22 10:03:34	GreatEmerald	_genuser_: Maybe you should stop making kernels panic instead :P
2016-02-22 10:03:56	_genuser_	GreatEmerald: you know a guy who doesn't spend much time tuning kernels, etc. etc. I just try to check off thigns I'll need.
2016-02-22 10:04:00	zeq	kernel panics are more likely faulty hardware (memory) or driver
2016-02-22 10:04:07	GreatEmerald	Also, yay, llvm is almost compiled. (200+ files of nothing but tests, sheesh)
2016-02-22 10:04:10	_genuser_	and then ugh put a scsi drive in a machine and BAM!
2016-02-22 10:04:32	_genuser_	everything just panics after a scsi. I never seem to check the right options the firs time.
2016-02-22 10:04:39	_genuser_	it takes quite a few panics before I get it to boot all the way.
2016-02-22 10:04:41	zeq	GreatEmerald: there's a reason test isn't enabled by default :)

2016-02-22 10:43:53	masonhauk	not a determmining factor to the what i need to get done
2016-02-22 10:43:58	masonhauk	so no worries
2016-02-22 10:44:18	masonhauk	although what im thinking is https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LiveUSB/Guide using gentoo livedvd
2016-02-22 10:44:52	masonhauk	in lets say a vmware runing gentoo live dvd to install gentoo live dvd on usb
2016-02-22 10:44:59	masonhauk	correct? woud that work?
2016-02-22 10:45:41	wokko	masonhauk: Think of unetbootin/rufus as a virtual cdrom drive. When you put whatever on a usbdrive it is actully making your usbdrive as a virtual cdrom drive, so that now you are basically playing an iso image.
2016-02-22 10:46:11	masonhauk	yaaa
2016-02-22 10:46:16	GreatEmerald	masonhauk: But what are you trying to do? If you just want a Gentoo installation on USB, you can just install Gentoo on USB. IF you want a LiveCD on a USB, then you can just dd a liveCD on a USB.
2016-02-22 10:46:18	masonhauk	thats what i found out

2016-02-22 10:47:05	masonhauk	wokko, how do i get a regular install just like livedvd, should I fallow https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LiveUSB/Guide . will that do it?
2016-02-22 10:47:32	GreatEmerald	masonhauk: Define "like a regular install just like livedvd"
2016-02-22 10:47:51	Tipping_Fedora	GreatEmerald: persistance (or so it sounds)

2016-02-22 10:47:58	wokko	masonhauk: No, you just need to treat the usb drive as an actully install hdd and follow the normal handbook
2016-02-22 10:48:27	wokko	actual*
2016-02-22 10:49:31	GreatEmerald	masonhauk: Is the fact that you need to start from a LiveCD confusing you? Yes, you will need two USB devices, one to have the LiveCD to install from, and one USB device to install to.
2016-02-22 10:49:32	masonhauk	greatemerald, I want a gentoo install not livecd or livedvd. not a iso vm on a usb. I figured there must be a way to put gentoo livedvd on to the usb using it and as installed as a regular install os..not iso locked like vm or iso
2016-02-22 10:49:55	wokko	masonhauk: you can dd the livedvd onto an usbdrive and boot from it and plug in another usb drive to install you os on.
2016-02-22 10:50:05	_genuser_	livecd or livedvd is used for installation. you want the livecd itself on a usb, but you want it as an installation.
2016-02-22 10:50:09	_genuser_	that's conflicting goals.
2016-02-22 10:50:14	masonhauk	well i understand that, wokko.

2016-02-22 10:50:32	_genuser_	what you probably should do is install it to the usb and make it _like_ the livedvd with the same kde and same tools.
2016-02-22 10:50:40	Tipping_Fedora	masonhauk: Is what your shooting for persistance?
2016-02-22 10:50:59	_genuser_	plus doesn't unetbootin allow you to create persistence too? with livecds?
2016-02-22 10:51:03	masonhauk	gentoo os on usb for my new laptop
2016-02-22 10:51:33	masonhauk	I have windows with vmware i figure i would just install from there

2016-02-22 12:05:19	nebg	i should check the chipset then..
2016-02-22 12:05:22	nebg	i mean the SoC
2016-02-22 12:05:42	nebg	thanks tomboy64 now i have a better understanding of the problem...
2016-02-22 12:05:51	nebg	but how do they boot those devices ?

2016-02-22 12:05:56	tomboy64	nebg: indeed. apart from what i've just said, running gentoo on embedded systems is very much possible. #gentoo-embedded and #gentoo-arm

2016-02-22 12:06:46	nebg	tomboy64, or how do i understand which is the cpu in my router  ?
2016-02-22 12:07:09	Tipping_Fedora	Gotta be honest though I do enjoy compiling everything I can locally
2016-02-22 12:07:17	tomboy64	nebg: usually those devices have some kind of bootstrapping mechanism. if you're lucky they have a usb port to boot from. if you're unlucky you'll need to start soldering. usually you can somehow flash a running system (and risk bricking it in the process)

2016-02-22 12:07:25	+iamben	Tipping_Fedora: icedtea itself builds from source and needs some java deps to build itself, that's why -bin is needed first.  once you get real icedtea installed, you can remove the -bin

2016-02-22 12:08:03	Tipping_Fedora	ok cool
2016-02-22 12:08:08	tomboy64	or emerge --deselect - if you just want it out of world
2016-02-22 12:08:09	+iamben	Tipping_Fedora: emerge -c foo    is a safe unmerge, checks for dependencies.   -C is unsafe unmerge
2016-02-22 12:08:15	Tipping_Fedora	I really should man emerge
2016-02-22 12:08:22	tomboy64	man emerge, man portage, man make.conf are your friends.
2016-02-22 12:08:30	Tipping_Fedora	but man pages normally confuse me more than anything else

2016-02-22 12:09:51	tomboy64	don't tell anyone, but so is mine
2016-02-22 12:09:52	artois	it seems weird to have to explicitly disable 15 flags to get VIDEO_CARDS back to the way it used to be
2016-02-22 12:10:10	+iamben	artois: if you set it yourself, it overrides all defaults
2016-02-22 12:10:34	artois	iamben: not doing that for me
2016-02-22 12:10:37	+iamben	artois: it's had all these enabled for a LONG time, but i have opened a bug to get it trimmed back a little saner
2016-02-22 12:10:52	+iamben	artois: are you using portage or an alternative PM?
2016-02-22 12:11:00	artois	portage
2016-02-22 12:11:22	+iamben	it's a non-incremental var, so if you set VIDEO_CARDS="foo" in make.conf it should override all defaults

2016-02-22 12:15:06	+iamben	artois: some vars like USE & FEATURES are incremental-- in make.conf you just set USE="foo bar" and it adds to what's already set, it doesn't wipe out defaults.  others like VIDEO_CARDS and PYTHON_TARGETS are not incremental-- if you set them, it wipes out the default setting

2016-02-22 12:16:17	Outcast	Hey, little trouble I'm having, anybody mind helping me if I forgot a few options from the menu config of the kernel?

2016-02-22 12:24:03	artois	as to your original question, you could have, for example, used '~media-tv/kodi-15.2'

2016-02-22 12:27:28	+iamben	ok there was no change in gentoo repo, i dunno what YOU changed
2016-02-22 12:27:49	artois	all I changed with VIDEO_CARDS="${VIDEO_CARDS}, but that was a separate matter
2016-02-22 12:28:14	+iamben	well i hope you learned some things about USE and VIDEO_CARDS today, i guess
2016-02-22 12:28:23	Outcast	I may have missed if someone responded to me. I'm a total noob here, just trying to figure out basics behind a kernel upgrade, as I missed some options my first time through.  Problem is, the wiki page isn't making much sense, and I can't seem to find anything else.
2016-02-22 12:28:34	artois	I did, I learned they're pointlessly different in their interpretation =)
2016-02-22 12:28:47	artois	Outcast: mmhmm?
2016-02-22 12:29:05	+iamben	VIDEO_CARDS is a USE_EXPAND var, and those are incremental
2016-02-22 12:29:18	+iamben	it's different from USE in that way.
2016-02-22 12:29:29	artois	yes indeed, I see that
2016-02-22 12:29:34	artois	I'm not sure how that's helpful is all
2016-02-22 12:29:39	artois	seems... the opposite

2016-02-22 12:31:28	+iamben	sorry i tried to help figure it out
2016-02-22 12:31:35	artois	no I appreciate it
2016-02-22 12:31:42	artois	but my memory has always been sound, I've no reason to doubt it
2016-02-22 12:32:00	artois	there have been many odd changes in the tree & portage over the years, though
2016-02-22 12:32:01	chry	It's like this: if the default is VIDEO_CARDS="drv1 drv2 drv3 drv4" and you set VIDEO_CARDS="drv2" then all the other ones from defaults get unset...
2016-02-22 12:32:04	artois	plenty of reason to suspect that
2016-02-22 12:32:13	artois	chry: yup, but not with USE
2016-02-22 12:32:13	chry	That's non-incremental...
2016-02-22 12:32:28	artois	chry: right, I just don't get why we have the two different behaviors
2016-02-22 12:32:59	+iamben	generally you want to keep default USE even when you add some.  generally the opposite is true of USE
2016-02-22 12:33:12	artois	of VIDEO_CARDS?
2016-02-22 12:33:30	artois	I don't see why the opposite would be true for VIDEO_CARDS...
2016-02-22 12:33:32	 > 	echo-area (~user@123.120.131.50) has joined #gentoo
2016-02-22 12:33:34	+iamben	yes, why would you want to keep that huge long list of default VIDEO_CARDS when you define it?
2016-02-22 12:33:43	artois	in fact I'd assumed it was the same as USE this whole time
2016-02-22 12:33:45	+iamben	otherwise you're forced to use -* on all of these vars
2016-02-22 12:33:58	artois	it certainly behaved that way, but obviously just the lesser defaults made me think that
2016-02-22 12:34:24	artois	I don't have a huge list of defaults when I define my USE
2016-02-22 12:34:43	+iamben	but if you set USE=foo you dont want it to wipe out profile & package defaults, do you?
2016-02-22 12:34:51	artois	why wouldn't I want the "huge" list of defaults for VIDEO_CARDS? It used to be either tiny or nothing at all
2016-02-22 12:35:08	+iamben	if you set it yourself then you probably don't want the rest..
2016-02-22 12:35:20	+iamben	unless you're building a livecd or something i suppose

2016-02-22 12:36:57	artois	there are defaults, and I'm adding to my use by saying USE="foo" which becomes defaults + foo

2016-02-22 12:37:15	+iamben	do you want me to find the history of the portage source where it defines what's incremental and what's not?
2016-02-22 12:37:28	artois	they're very minimal configs I've used similarly for about 10 years at least
2016-02-22 12:37:39	artois	iamben: no
2016-02-22 12:37:45	artois	but if you happen to know the justification for the differing behaviors
2016-02-22 12:37:46	Tipping_Fedora	ehh
2016-02-22 12:37:48	artois	I'm curious
2016-02-22 12:38:04	artois	Tipping_Fedora: working?
2016-02-22 12:38:06	+iamben	the source of this is your own misunderstanding and confusion
2016-02-22 12:38:24	artois	the only misunderstanding I had was with ${VIDEO_CARDS}, which is caused by this behavior
2016-02-22 12:38:27	Tipping_Fedora	no idea yet
2016-02-22 12:38:33	Tipping_Fedora	waiting on icedtea
2016-02-22 12:38:36	artois	which I do not indeed understand
2016-02-22 12:39:20	+iamben	artois: some vars are generally best handled as incremental, some are best non-incremental.  for general use.  the people writing/maintaining portage make a judgement call.
2016-02-22 12:39:54	artois	I just don't see how, though; I mean they're all USE flags in the end anyway, right?
2016-02-22 12:40:09	artois	why should USE="foo" and VIDEO_CARDS="foo" differ
2016-02-22 12:40:22	+iamben	artois: VIDEO_CARDS is a USE_EXPAND var but it's treated as non-incremental before it gets expanded
2016-02-22 12:40:32	+iamben	if you want to see if one's incremental, try adding -* at the beginning, portage will bark at you saying that you cannot use -* in non-incremental vars

2016-02-22 12:40:59	artois	what I still don't get is why there are two different types at all =)
2016-02-22 12:40:59	+iamben	as another example-- if you set CFLAGS, you want to override the defautl CFLAGS right? not append?
2016-02-22 12:41:15	artois	I get what they do, but not why they each exist

2016-02-22 12:41:25	+iamben	but if you set FEATURES=distcc, you want to append to default features, not override
2016-02-22 12:41:56	chry	VIDEO_CARDS="${VIDEO_CARDS}" <--- You set default to be default and NOT to be anything else... When you do the same thing for USE you'd just set defaults/already defined flags and be able to add to it...
2016-02-22 12:42:02	+iamben	having some of the vars incremental just makes for an easier user experience in many places
2016-02-22 12:42:24	artois	chry: way past that now, but thanks
2016-02-22 12:42:45	artois	I'm not sure I ever want to override
2016-02-22 12:43:11	artois	appending is just as good, because I can append an override
2016-02-22 12:43:13	+iamben	what about GENTOO_MIRRORS?
2016-02-22 12:43:14	artois	as with USE
2016-02-22 12:43:21	artois	you tell me, what about it
2016-02-22 12:43:22	+iamben	most people want override there

2016-02-22 12:43:46	+iamben	it's not very intuitive that you'd have to do GENTOO_MIRRORS="-* http://mymirror/" to set a single mirror
2016-02-22 12:43:47	artois	why, what're the defaults?
2016-02-22 12:44:10	kurly	artois: the default for VIDEO_CARDS is all the video cards.  the default for locales is all the locales.  it is assumed that when you specify your settings, you are overriding the defaults.
2016-02-22 12:44:14	chry	Well, that's the point... USE variable defaults are set by chosen system profile, and those variables should NOT be overrriden...that's why it's incremental... VIDEO_CARDS however is a list of a lot of flags and SHOULD be overriden by user's choice.
2016-02-22 12:44:17	Outcast	Anyone?
2016-02-22 12:44:24	artois	I think I'd say it's not very intuitive to have incredibly large defaults, instead

2016-02-22 14:46:57	Outcast	_genuser_: Others would be more helpful than me, but just curious; are you still able to ping out? Is it just the local subnet unable to talk to your IP? Can others ping eachother within that subnet?

2016-02-22 14:48:23	Outcast	Is the subnet statically assigned?
2016-02-22 14:48:45	_genuser_	so FiOS-Internet -> VerizonRouter (subnet 1) -> Router2 (subnet 2, office).
2016-02-22 14:49:11	_genuser_	wifi laptop is on VerizonRouter subnet 1. Router itself is set to 192.168.1.1 (so I'd assume the answer to your question is that the subnet is statically assigned.
2016-02-22 14:49:22	_genuser_	but the laptop receives that information over wifi/dhcp

2016-02-22 14:51:11	_genuser_	to clarify 192.168.0.3 ssh's into target 192.168.1.7 and works just fine, so I'd assume my subnet routing is fine. after a few hours tho, the connectivity freezes. then you can't ping that machine either.

2016-02-22 16:06:42	adeel_	_genuser_: no worries
2016-02-22 16:06:57	_genuser_	ok the laptop can ping it's own dhcp router 192.168.1.1

2016-02-22 16:07:24	adeel_	_genuser_: can it ping anything on the other devices network?

2016-02-22 16:08:31	adeel_	this is sounding like more of a network issue than a device/OS issue
2016-02-22 16:09:09	_genuser_	adeel_: hmm, I'd be inclined to think that, but if i reboot the laptop it's accessible from subnet2. it can ping the main router for subnet2.
2016-02-22 16:09:40	_genuser_	that's kinda why I was thinking, I wonder if VerizonRouter the main one is handling wifi things differently
2016-02-22 16:09:43	_genuser_	or something.
2016-02-22 16:10:03	_genuser_	but a reboot fixes it, and the routers don't need to be rebooted at all.

2016-02-22 16:13:08	adeel_	_genuser_: any reason why you've got such a complex network deployment?
2016-02-22 16:13:14	_genuser_	I remember that always works. I expose my fileserver thru the router

2016-02-22 16:13:45	adeel_	or NAT issue
2016-02-22 16:13:48	_genuser_	adeel_: well everybody else is facebooking and downloading clicking stuff. I have my office network behind a second router to prevent incoming to that router.
2016-02-22 16:14:14	adeel_	_genuser_: ah....a simple firewall may be a better solution than a full on separate router
2016-02-22 16:14:23	_genuser_	adeel_: hmm, I see. You're saying after a reboot and a new IP, the computer is registered on all routers. but after a while the state is lost?
2016-02-22 16:14:39	adeel_	_genuser_: yeah, something to that kind of affect....
2016-02-22 16:14:45	_genuser_	adeel_: well, I could turn my router 2 to a dumb switch and setup a firewall.

2016-02-22 16:15:26	_genuser_	adeel_: but this stuff isn't lost in the windows world. for example my parents computer can always access my second router. so they can do \\router2 and it gets to my router and gets port forwarded to my samba server.
2016-02-22 16:15:45	_genuser_	that computer is on vista
2016-02-22 16:16:10	adeel_	_genuser_: all the wired components can access all the networks all the time?

2016-02-22 16:17:57	adeel_	strange
2016-02-22 16:18:08	_genuser_	adeel_: so I did /etc/init.d/dhcpcd restart;
2016-02-22 16:18:09	adeel_	check the logs of the outside router to see if there's a reason
2016-02-22 16:18:16	_genuser_	and I can once again ssh into the machine.
2016-02-22 16:18:34	adeel_	_genuser_: so either your DHCP lease times out, or the wireless drops, or something strange
2016-02-22 16:18:51	adeel_	_genuser_: what happens if you statically assign the laptop an IP rather than use DHCP?
2016-02-22 16:18:52	_genuser_	oh oh one more thign. when laptop was running windows 7/8/10 (upgraded), I could _always_ access it. via the same subnet setup
2016-02-22 16:18:55	adeel_	does it still drop?
2016-02-22 16:19:22	_genuser_	as much as static ips make more sense, I just dislike them somehow. but I haven't tried that.
2016-02-22 16:19:44	_genuser_	so when teh laptop had windows I could always access it using the 192.168.1.0/24 IP
2016-02-22 16:20:01	_genuser_	but on linux it drops. Now secondly, I will try to setup a static IP and see how it goes.
2016-02-22 16:20:07	adeel_	i'm not much of a linux wifi guy, so i can't really help diagnose what's wrong with the wpa2 config
2016-02-22 16:20:08	_genuser_	but we'll need to give it a few hours I suppose.
2016-02-22 16:20:27	_genuser_	I'll have to check how to enable wpa_supplicant without dhcpcd.
2016-02-22 16:20:34	_genuser_	right now I Have dhcpcd configured to auto launch it.
2016-02-22 16:20:52	_genuser_	oh wait, I had the wpa_supplicant in runlevel default before and it was auto starting.
2016-02-22 16:21:01	_genuser_	I can then add it back to that and setup a static IP.

2016-02-23 01:50:18	zeq	definitely

2016-02-23 01:53:04	Lowl3v3l	is there a possibility to configure emerge to always build development-critical packages like gcc and glibc first and then use the tools to build all the other software i may want?

2016-02-23 01:56:34	GreatEmerald	zeq: It's also a bug in the Mesa build system, because configure --help says --disable-asm is automatic by platform. So it fails to detect platform right in that case

2016-02-23 01:58:38	zeq	most likely it's not checkout for x32 at all, just assuming x86-64.  It's what most things do

2016-02-23 02:50:38	+iamben	Tipping_Fedora: on a binary distro, when a package has optional cups (printer) support, they enable it because some users may need to print.  on gentoo you choose, so you can disable print support @ build time if you know you'll never use it.
2016-02-23 02:50:42	Tipping_Fedora	I'm new to all this so...
2016-02-23 02:50:58	Tipping_Fedora	ok
2016-02-23 02:51:02	Tipping_Fedora	thats somthing
2016-02-23 02:51:20	Tipping_Fedora	so, what does the system do I if just use emerge <packagename>
2016-02-23 02:51:24	bugnuts	is there any security configuration advantage to the binary distro?
2016-02-23 02:51:49	bugnuts	or well, what is the advantage of the binary distro
2016-02-23 02:51:50	+iamben	Tipping_Fedora: im not sure what you're asking about, the optional features or the lib versions

2016-02-23 02:52:53	zeq	bugnuts: the advantage of binary distributions is they manage everything for you, and can give support on the versions they know you have.
2016-02-23 02:53:07	+iamben	Tipping_Fedora: your portage profile sets the default USE flags.  USE flags are what control these optional features.

2016-02-23 02:58:37	+iamben	ByteBiter: unfortunately you cannot (yet) mix arbitrary profile components, you are limited to some premade combinations.  but you can get systemd support on that desktop profile by just adding USE="systemd -consolekit" in make.conf

2016-02-23 03:03:04	+iamben	ByteBiter: you need to set USE="systemd -consolekit" globally at the very least, also the systemd profile masks genkernel which has known problems on systemd
2016-02-23 03:03:19	+iamben	but again it's not REQUIRED to use the systemd profile for systemd, it just sets some helpful default flags

2016-02-23 04:00:03	GreatEmerald	zeq: Hm? I'm saying that if you have a GTK2 panel, then you're running XWayland all the time and there's thus no point in using Wayland since you're on X anyway
2016-02-23 04:00:35	zeq	instead of client->X->compostitor-X you get client->Xwayland->wayland-compositor

2016-02-23 04:01:33	GreatEmerald	grawity: xorg right now, I believe. It could be cut down in features later on
2016-02-23 04:02:06	grawity	so it's [client --X11-> Xorg --X11-> compositor --X11-> Xorg --> DRI] vs [client --X11-> Xwayland --Wayland-> compositor --> DRI]
2016-02-23 04:02:10	zeq	Xorg. client to Xorg is X11 protocol X->compositor->Xis via extensions DDX/DRI
2016-02-23 04:02:13	grawity	yeah, I guess it *is* shorter
2016-02-23 04:02:40	zeq	yeah, I oversimplified it

2016-02-23 04:04:56	zeq	GreatEmerald: never noticed.  Fullscreen 3D isn't as fast if going through Xwayland because it doesn't take advantage of the compositor by-pass that X compositors usually do

2016-02-23 05:12:59	+iamben	but usually glsa-check is used as part of a larger plan of NOT upgrading anythign except what's needed for security

2016-02-23 06:44:28	R0b0t1	ekneuss: No idea. Your guess sounds pretty reasonable, because I think some of the disk loading stuff is overeager.
2016-02-23 06:44:57	R0b0t1	Mine involved abuse of LVM and RAID and initrd.

2016-02-23 20:20:33	mvaenskae	alright, then i deduced correctly :)
2016-02-23 20:21:05	mvaenskae	i was confused as to why it was still present now that it is being reworked
2016-02-23 20:21:22	kurly	kdbus has a bad enough reputation amongst people who know what they're doing that they had to rename the project to bus1 or something like that
2016-02-23 20:21:26	Kelsar	so you can enable and test it
2016-02-23 20:23:39	mvaenskae	i was mainly interested in what the current recommendation is
2016-02-23 20:24:14	mvaenskae	i want to give systemd a proper try and understand/experience it before actually judging it wrongly
2016-02-23 20:24:30	mvaenskae	and also to be better educated :)
2016-02-23 20:25:11	mvaenskae	been running over half a decade with openrc so i think its time to at least check out something different;

2016-02-23 20:26:56	GreatEmerald	kurly: bus1 is not a rename, it's a complete rewrite and not even related to dbus now
2016-02-23 20:26:57	Kelsar	mvaenskae: if you want to play with systemd-networkd too, make sure you use the latest systemd version
2016-02-23 20:27:31	GreatEmerald	Kelsar: It works just fine for me on the stable version
2016-02-23 20:27:52	Kelsar	GreatEmerald: there are some features missing and some defaults changed
2016-02-23 20:28:04	mvaenskae	i am running with keyword so i should have that :)

2016-02-23 20:35:41	mvaenskae	that resulted in an unreadable package.use on my end as i had some enabled, some disabled
2016-02-23 20:36:17	mvaenskae	i hated that and now roll with my own package.use
2016-02-23 20:36:41	mvaenskae	has around 1200 packages so far
2016-02-23 20:37:14	GreatEmerald	Well, suit yourself. In that case you might as well read the ebuild and look at which flags are default, then set them...
2016-02-23 20:37:35	mvaenskae	there are 3 defaults, including kdbus
2016-02-23 20:37:51	mvaenskae	that is what made me ask in here what the state on kdbus is

2016-02-23 20:39:29	mvaenskae	if i cannot trust the default USE then something is wrong with the ebuild imho
2016-02-23 20:39:48	GreatEmerald	Hm, what determines which file --autounmask-write writes to? I thought it was the alphabetically first one, but that doesn't seem to be the case
2016-02-23 20:40:08	kurly	GreatEmerald: last
2016-02-23 20:40:18	kurly	mvaenskae: what package has a wrong default USE?
2016-02-23 20:40:41	GreatEmerald	mvaenskae: +kdbus is harmless, so there's no big deal. Also, why are you talking about trusting default USE when you have that disabled to begin with :P
2016-02-23 20:40:47	mvaenskae	kurly: systemd still sets +kdbus per default
2016-02-23 20:41:22	zeq	kurly:
2016-02-23 20:41:23	mvaenskae	if systemd has +kdbus why should i not set it on the kernel as well?
2016-02-23 20:41:50	mvaenskae	it's a dead feature from what i gathered and needs an update to the ebuild
2016-02-23 20:42:02	mvaenskae	it wrongfully promotes kdbus as being usable
2016-02-23 20:42:42	GreatEmerald	mvaenskae: Sure, it's a trivial bug if you like
2016-02-23 20:42:43	zeq	kurly: kdbus wasn't bad.  Most of the issues people had was it just did *too* much.  It implemented too much of dbus in order to maintain compatibility

2016-02-24 00:06:43	Z-Chymera	hi guys, I am still having an issue with this app, the GUI of which displays well in xfce but badly in gnome3. I have tried to manually set a gtk2 theme, with `ln -s /usr/share/themes/Industrial/gtk-2.0/gtkrc ~/.gtkrc-2.0` - but this still has not solved my issue. I think it is an element spacing thing rather than a theming thing. But I son't know how I could tweak the latter. my issue looks like so: chymera.eu/debug/mricrogl.png and (with a

2016-02-24 00:09:22	GreatEmerald	zeq: Hum. qconnman-ui gives me a window with a blank box.
2016-02-24 00:10:32	+iamben	GreatEmerald: out of curiosity, are you aiming for mostly qt5 or qt4 on this setup?

2016-02-24 00:13:01	GreatEmerald	Though connmanctl for my user also gives errors and doesn't list technologies. I assume something is up with permissions

2016-02-24 07:32:25	kchndr	ok, I will try then. It's been a long time since I last tried, might've been the early days.
2016-02-24 07:33:05	purplefrog	I'm trying to get my gentoo to boot by default from a new computer that uses UEFI.  I tried the grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot mentioned at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Bootloader, but while that does create an entry I can see with efibootmgr, that entry is not functional.  When I use efibootmgr -n 3 the BIOS complains about an invalid signature
2016-02-24 07:33:21	+iamben	kchndr: on bios you can rely on the VGA console for early boot, or in case fb drivers don't work.  on uefi there is no vga console, so you MUST have fb console to get a display

2016-02-24 07:38:19	+iamben	if you want continuous display, i think what you're supposed to do is used grub2 + simplefb, to provide display before your other driver kicks in
2016-02-24 07:38:19		[07:38]
2016-02-24 07:38:37	+iamben	grub2 will initialize the fb then simplefb reuses it
2016-02-24 07:40:02	GreatEmerald	iamben: How does that interact with the efifb early boot logging option?
2016-02-24 07:40:32	+iamben	GreatEmerald: not sure on that
2016-02-24 07:40:50	zeq	so does grub2 pass the fb parameters to  the kernel?
2016-02-24 07:40:53	GreatEmerald	And what if grub can't get the right resolution since it's not provided?
2016-02-24 07:41:15	+iamben	zeq: if you are on efi you should see something in a generated grub.cfg about "gfxpayload"
2016-02-24 07:41:16	GreatEmerald	(not provided by the UEFI I mean)
2016-02-24 07:41:30	+iamben	it passes that graphics "payload" somehow

Unfortunately, if I reboot again, the -n 3 flag has faded and the boot menu has only the DVD and not the gentoo system in it.
2016-02-24 07:43:59	purplefrog	I wonder if this Acer just can't put "insecure" EFI records in its boot menu.

2016-02-24 07:44:46	GreatEmerald	I always wanted to achieve nice-looking boot with a Plymouth boot animation, but so far my success has been limited. Last I tried, Plymouth somehow failed to start in initrd, so it would only appear after root is mounted
2016-02-24 07:46:55	GreatEmerald	Thing is that grub's vbeinfo only shows three modes, none of which are the native resolution

2016-02-24 08:51:09	+iamben	Inv1s1ble: try diabling it @ build time, or in about:config.  it's not needed if you set USE=ffmpeg on firefox
2016-02-24 08:51:48	+iamben	Inv1s1ble: firefox is moving from gstreamer backend to direct ffmpeg backend for media playback, 44 supports both but gstreamer may cause stability issues there

Now that I'm updating all, portage sees that putting -64 on some would no longer make it consistent, just that it doesn't try too hard to solve it

2016-02-24 15:07:27	slobber	hi
2016-02-24 15:08:51	slobber	i'm trying to install gentoo on a uefi system with nvidia graphics. i've got separate boot, home and var partitions, so no initramfs for me. i'm using syslinux. i'm able to boot into syslinux, select the entry, but when i do the kernel shows it loads ok, usb devices turn off then on, and the screen stays the same. i can't move around in syslinux or anything, but ctrl-alt-del works for rebooting
2016-02-24 15:09:58	slobber	i tried switching to integrated graphics, made sure i'm setting correct root in syslinux, made sure /boot is vfat and ef02 type

2016-02-24 16:27:02	gentoo_installer	wow
2016-02-24 16:27:27	gentoo_installer	thats actually kinda crazy. So if you want to do a systemd install dont use desktop/kde/systemd as a base profile
2016-02-24 16:29:09	gentoo_installer	well, this made my day
2016-02-24 16:30:28	wraeth	gentoo_installer: it would be caused by the fact that the kde profile would pull in a lot of packages by default. when making changes like that, ensure the system is fully up-to-date, and make the profile switches as small as possible (ie, kde->kde/systemd, rather than desktop->kde/systemd)

2016-02-24 18:45:06	epitamizor	if he installed the bin version it should be enabled
2016-02-24 18:45:20	kurly	hey it's almost like I asked for versions twice now ;)

2016-02-24 18:50:44	oxygen424242	Speaking of framebuffer, when I boot up my machine the resolution is a bit small and then it switches to my 1920x1080. Is there a way to remove that small flicker of low res?

2016-02-24 18:52:34	oxygen424242	It's only for a split second and I've toyed with different framebuffer options to no avail. I've see it on multiple other machines as well.
2016-02-24 18:52:35	kurly	oxygen424242: having the framebuffer module built into the kernel might reduce it, but not sure you can remove it.  if any firmware is required for the framebuffer module, you'd need that built into the kernel.
2016-02-24 18:53:33	oxygen424242	kurly: I'll give that a try
2016-02-24 18:53:35	epitamizor	pass modesetting option to grub boot menu
2016-02-24 18:54:08	kurly	the earlier the switch occurs, the less perceptible it should be
2016-02-24 18:54:24	oxygen424242	kurly: So enable Framebuffer Console Support as a module, right?
2016-02-24 18:54:39	oxygen424242	kurly: *Then emerge a world update
2016-02-24 18:54:45	kurly	it probably already is a module

2016-02-24 18:56:25	kurly	if you want to totally eliminate the switch, not sure how to proceed
2016-02-24 18:56:34	kurly	then you're already set up to be about as fast as you can
2016-02-24 18:56:52	kurly	maybe epitamizor's idea has merit
2016-02-24 18:57:04	kurly	I reboot infrequently enough that I'm not familiar with the tricks to make it prettier
