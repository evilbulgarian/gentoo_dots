2016-01-20 23:06:37	mort_	soeh
2016-01-21 00:09:21	mort_	what do you do when you did `usermod -G somegroup username`, forgetting the -a, so that you're not part of the sudo group anymore and don't have a root password
2016-01-21 00:11:46	mort_	anyone there?
2016-01-21 00:12:07	venam	mort_: not sure
2016-01-21 00:12:14	venam	you overwrite all the groups
2016-01-21 00:12:26	venam	I think that's not valid until next login, no?
2016-01-21 00:13:23	mort_	mhm, but I relogged, because I wanted the new group
2016-01-21 00:14:47	mort_	including restarting tmux
2016-01-21 00:15:21	mort_	if I'm lucky, I'm logged in at a tty at home

2016-01-21 00:18:18	venam	or you can't?
2016-01-21 00:18:22	venam	VPS?
2016-01-21 00:18:56	mort_	it's my own physical server
2016-01-21 00:19:02	mort_	I could email myself, but that wouldn't really helep
2016-01-21 00:19:44	mort_	there's probably a root user there, but I can't recall the password; there's years since I installed the OS, and I've just used `sudo su` to get root
2016-01-21 00:21:20	venam	mort_: that's lame
2016-01-21 00:21:28	venam	do you have another user?
2016-01-21 00:21:41	venam	you could still boot from a cd and add yourself to the sudoer file
2016-01-21 00:21:43	venam	I think so
2016-01-21 00:21:57	venam	not sure of the procedure
2016-01-21 00:24:40	mort_	there is another user; didn't remember the password to that either (always just done `sudo su <user>`), but got it after a couple of tries just now
2016-01-21 00:24:48	mort_	and it has sudo access, so yay :)
2016-01-21 01:06:32	seth	mort_: this is why I do everything as root :P
2016-01-21 01:06:44	seth	I've been bitten by usermod before
2016-01-21 01:15:14	mort_	making usermod -G default to deleting all your groups sounds like a footgun
2016-01-21 01:24:55	seth	just edit /etc/gshadow directly :P

2016-01-21 02:44:57	dami	failing that, boot a live distro and chroot

2016-01-21 11:17:04	neeasade	now 
2016-01-21 11:17:09	neeasade	the dangerous/tricky part
2016-01-21 11:17:15	neeasade	is if dealing with signed vars/ints
2016-01-21 11:17:25	neeasade	because if the 1 ends up on the left, it's negative ofc.

2016-01-21 11:17:47	neeasade	paul: it shifts bits, but the values that enter are 0's
2016-01-21 11:17:56	paul	not when shifting right :p
2016-01-21 11:17:57	adam	but what variable type do you usually use when dealing with them?
2016-01-21 11:18:11	neeasade	adam: typically ints
2016-01-21 11:18:15	neeasade	but it's been a year
2016-01-21 11:18:17	neeasade	so iirc.
2016-01-21 11:18:28	paul	depending on the language handles data types
2016-01-21 11:18:37	paul	                ^how
2016-01-21 11:19:08	paul	signedness matters when you get above a really big number
2016-01-21 11:19:15	neeasade	yes.

2016-01-21 13:14:24	arc	wmutils was what really tought me how to script properly
2016-01-21 13:15:13	fsociety	you could even try and write your scripts in C instead of bash, that would be an interesting task regarding wmutils
2016-01-21 13:15:21	arc	thing is
2016-01-21 13:15:37	arc	at that point you'd be running a WM using wmutils as a backend with a boatload of system() calls
2016-01-21 13:15:41	arc	not wmutils
2016-01-21 13:16:06	fsociety	i've seen a few python projects that use wmutils as its backend
2016-01-21 13:16:15	arc	that would be something interesting, yes
2016-01-21 13:16:21	arc	for larger scripts I usually use python
2016-01-21 13:16:26	arc	but that's rare

2016-01-21 13:47:46	adam	THREE HOUR
2016-01-21 13:47:46	rocx	Heh. 'Cause no one wants class on Saturdays.
2016-01-21 13:47:48	adam	SAT MORNING
2016-01-21 13:47:50	adam	WHAT THE FUCK
2016-01-21 13:47:58	rocx	To be fair it was the only one I could get at the time.
2016-01-21 13:48:27	adam	i couldve gotten the 1 pm java class and not have class until like, well, 1
2016-01-21 13:48:30	adam	but nope
2016-01-21 13:48:41	adam	registered too late for that cause freshmen are fuckin losers
2016-01-21 13:49:09	rocx	Heck, too many of my other classes don't fit into other things so I'm practically a sophomore.
2016-01-21 13:49:18	rocx	I don't want to be too late to the HOPE once I bring my GPA up.
2016-01-21 13:53:42	rocx	And I probably shouldn't be in this class since it replaced another one that I got transfer credit for.
2016-01-21 13:54:06	rocx	And looooood help me once precalc, calc, and discrete comes into the picture.
2016-01-21 13:54:36	adam	calculus is easier than discrete
2016-01-21 13:54:38	adam	so much easier
2016-01-21 13:54:43	rocx	Not going to disagree.
2016-01-21 13:54:52	adam	but discrete is more interesting
2016-01-21 13:54:54	adam	at least to me
2016-01-21 13:55:10	rocx	Just got a ton of stuff I also need to take like three credhours of some phys-ed classes, management, and more.
2016-01-21 13:55:21	rocx	And then there's the option of minoring in English.
2016-01-21 13:55:22	adam	because calculus analyzes the known, unless you're dealing with indefiniate problems
2016-01-21 13:55:32	adam	discrete analyzes the unknown/possible
2016-01-21 13:55:34	rocx	Discrete's one of those things I heard benefits CS.
2016-01-21 13:55:37	adam	it does
2016-01-21 13:55:39	adam	a shit tone
2016-01-21 13:55:43	adam	its also hard as fuck
2016-01-21 13:55:57	rocx	Heck I still can't truly grasp pointers.
2016-01-21 13:56:02	adam	im thinking of switching my math minor into an eng minor
2016-01-21 13:56:06	rocx	Maybe save for scanf which uses addresses as arguments.
2016-01-21 13:56:08	adam	i enjoy writing stories a lot
2016-01-21 13:56:20	rocx	I still need to do my dumb comic.
2016-01-21 13:56:29	rocx	Wonder if a book with a ton of pictures would still qualify.
2016-01-21 13:56:34	@fro	heh
2016-01-21 14:14:03	rocx	If there's one thing you have to hand internet radio, they've got more modern stuff than the twenty/thirty year old swill they're still chugging.
2016-01-21 14:14:20	rocx	*the swill they're chugging on FM radio
2016-01-21 14:15:50	rocx	It's going to be 2056 and they'll still act like Bob Seger is still relevant.
2016-01-21 14:18:26	adam	im not gonna sugar coat it
2016-01-21 14:18:37	adam	i prefer file io in c in comparison with java
2016-01-21 14:18:47	adam	ive got like 12 different objects
2016-01-21 14:18:53	adam	in c u just read that shit
2016-01-21 14:19:06	rocx	Even then, I still work with streams/stdin/stdout as opposed to files more.
2016-01-21 14:19:15	adam	dont get me wrong im beginning to respect java a bin
2016-01-21 14:19:17	adam	bit
2016-01-21 14:19:22	rocx	I still don't.
2016-01-21 14:19:27	adam	which just confirms my ignorance
2016-01-21 14:19:29	adam	but fuck this
2016-01-21 14:19:32	rocx	The only thing resembling Getopt is a GNU thing.
2016-01-21 14:19:46	adam	bro i messed with getopt/getopt_long a few years ago
2016-01-21 14:19:47	rocx	I mean sure I just whittled a second assignment using exceptions.
2016-01-21 14:20:07	adam	i still havent looked at ARGBEGIN/ARGEND though
2016-01-21 14:20:17	adam	which is what the BSD's/Plan 9 use i think
2016-01-21 14:20:21	adam	im assuming those are macros
2016-01-21 14:20:24	rocx	Plan 9's.
2016-01-21 14:20:34	rocx	It's a set of macros for handling arguments.
2016-01-21 14:21:04	rocx	Well, 20h's more-widespread version is based on Plan 9's similar concept.
2016-01-21 14:21:50	adam	20h?
2016-01-21 14:22:01	rocx	One of the cat-v guys.
2016-01-21 14:22:04	adam	ah
2016-01-21 14:22:13	adam	didnt suckless implement that too?
2016-01-21 14:22:17	rocx	They worship the machines Plan 9's been ran on, so there's no surprise.
2016-01-21 14:22:24	rocx	adam: Wouldn't be surprised. It's a simple thing to toss in.
2016-01-21 14:22:40	rocx	Just #include "arg.h", ARGBEGIN { with cases, } ARGEND.
2016-01-21 14:22:54	rocx	getopt(3) is more standardized but a little more confusing.
2016-01-21 14:27:12	rocx	Piss. It would've been cool to be able to use the local hostname instead of localhost for local servers.
2016-01-21 14:27:26	rocx	gopher://lappy-486 sounds sweet for testing.
2016-01-21 14:28:51	adam	i mean you can still do that
2016-01-21 14:30:22	adam	wouldnt that just be a line /etc/hosts?
2016-01-21 14:30:28	*	rocx shrugs.
2016-01-21 14:30:31	adam	or am i thinking of a world too perfect for us
2016-01-21 14:31:27	rocx	Tell you one thing, adam, on Java, that when you use the new line opening brace style like you would for C, it looks really alien on Java.
2016-01-21 14:32:03	rocx	Perfectly natural in C. WTF in Java.
2016-01-21 14:32:20	adam	i mean thats true for a lot of stuff
2016-01-21 14:32:25	adam	vim likes to double tab for indent
2016-01-21 14:32:28	adam	is that the norm?
2016-01-21 14:32:39	rocx	How big is a tab? 4char or 8chat?
2016-01-21 14:32:44	adam	ill always consider java as inferior to the powah of C but meh
2016-01-21 14:32:49	adam	4 char
2016-01-21 14:32:53	rocx	Then that's why.
2016-01-21 14:32:54	adam	id assume thats editor specific
2016-01-21 14:33:01	adam	wait tabs are 8 char in java?
2016-01-21 14:33:02	rocx	Yeah. That's the argument of tabs.
2016-01-21 14:33:16	adam	cause in C/bash/anything else its only 4char
2016-01-21 14:34:36	rocx	I (try) to go for spaces because 1) it forces a style on a simple text editor and 2) You should be using a big boy's editor if you plan on editing that code. One that can take care of those pesky indents.
2016-01-21 14:34:48	rocx	Inferior editors like Vim, Sublime Text, and Atom probably can.
2016-01-21 14:35:30	adam	i dont wanna use eclipse
2016-01-21 14:35:32	adam	pls
2016-01-21 14:35:41	rocx	I don't.
2016-01-21 14:35:43	adam	for the record
2016-01-21 14:35:50	adam	for the record my vim plugins do catch syntax errors
2016-01-21 14:36:08	rocx	Good then. It's probably a hackjob like Vimscript is but eh whatever.
2016-01-21 14:36:31	adam	vim's existence is a hackjob
2016-01-21 14:37:14	rocx	Neovim seems like it's going to crank the hackiness to "correct" enterprisey eleven.
2016-01-21 14:37:20	rocx	It even throws in a terminal emulator.
2016-01-21 14:37:42	rocx	Just for a plain text editor?
2016-01-21 14:37:43	adam	its got async plus plausible lua scripting support
2016-01-21 14:37:44	adam	ill take it
2016-01-21 14:37:45	rocx	Like really.
2016-01-21 14:38:08	adam	i mean we could go to the obvious end-all-be-all editor
2016-01-21 14:38:10	adam	...
2016-01-21 14:38:16	*	adam clears his throat
2016-01-21 14:38:17	fsociety	don't mention the "e" word
2016-01-21 14:38:22	rocx	Come on. You know the right words.
2016-01-21 14:38:34	adam	ACMEACMEACMEACMEACMAECMAMCMEAMCAEMCMEAMCMAEMCMAECM
2016-01-21 14:38:35	rocx	THERE IT IS!

2016-01-21 14:38:42	*	rocx blows open a party ball.
2016-01-21 14:38:53	rocx	fsociety: Acme, mang! Mang, acme!
2016-01-21 14:38:57	adam	YAY!
2016-01-21 14:39:02	 < 	feute (feute@Clk-F6D99A2.genericrev.cantv.net) has quit (feute)
2016-01-21 14:39:09	adam	fun fact, u can have a shell in an acme window
2016-01-21 14:39:14	adam	but heres the thing motherfuckers
2016-01-21 14:39:21	adam	its just an rc script that redirs i/o

2016-01-21 14:40:07	*	fsociety has to figure out what the theme song would be
2016-01-21 14:40:08	adam	Walkin fast
2016-01-21 14:40:19	adam	a thousand miles by vanessa carlton
2016-01-21 14:40:27	adam	that will be played at my funeral
2016-01-21 14:40:31	adam	no question
2016-01-21 14:40:50	fsociety	i'd request extreme grind core at my funeral just to annoy everyone
2016-01-21 14:41:14	fsociety	no funeral should be without blast beats ;)
2016-01-21 14:41:15	adam	Always Look on the Bright Side of Life
2016-01-21 14:41:24	rocx	dcat: We require your nation's top grindcore for fsociety's funeral.
2016-01-21 14:41:27	adam	with the greatest singer of our time Eric Idle
2016-01-21 14:41:43	rocx	Which should be in about...
2016-01-21 14:41:45	rocx	...Ten minutes.
2016-01-21 14:42:11	rocx	fsociety: Yeah I made the mistake of serving canned tuna to ya'll.
2016-01-21 14:42:17	adam	last i heard dcat he was thinkin about fucking jmbi's mom
2016-01-21 14:42:38	adam	oh shit now they're both gonna get me
2016-01-21 14:42:53	fsociety	rocx: hahahaha. ijust imagine someone doing a speech over grindcore
2016-01-21 14:42:59	fsociety	the thought just makes me laugh
2016-01-21 14:43:36	rocx	"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to..." (volume cranks up) "BLOOD ON STONE; HOLY PRIEST; NO ESCAPE; NO RELEASE; SACRIFIIIIIIIIIICE!"
2016-01-21 14:43:54	fsociety	or i request everyone do their speeches in black metal stylings
2016-01-21 14:44:12	rocx	fsociety: Okay I cheated that was traditional not black/grind.
2016-01-21 14:44:12	fsociety	screams "HE WILL BE SORELY MISSSEDDD.... IIIINN HEEELLLLLL *GUTTERAL SCREAM*
2016-01-21 14:45:18	*	rocx has a go at the guttural screaming and fails. He's gonna go get a cup of water now.
2016-01-21 14:45:49	fsociety	hahaha. i practice my gutterals while i drive to work. 
2016-01-21 14:46:16	rocx	Eh. Don't know why that black/grind/viking stuff became popular.
2016-01-21 14:46:44	rocx	It's like metal went from big hair and motorcycles to sacrifices to Lucifer in concerts and strumming at a gorillion BPM.
2016-01-21 14:47:02	fsociety	haha everything has its niche
2016-01-21 14:47:04	*	rocx tapes a wig to his head.
2016-01-21 14:47:06	fsociety	look at linux ;)
2016-01-21 14:47:38	rocx	Even the "elite" here will call Linux users DIRTY PEASANTS! from the BSD high horse.
2016-01-21 14:47:41	fsociety	personally i prefer my prog metal
2016-01-21 14:47:44	rocx	Kind of like BSD too.
2016-01-21 14:48:07	adam	rocx u still on void
2016-01-21 14:48:13	rocx	Sadly.
2016-01-21 14:48:17	adam	nooooooo

2016-01-21 14:48:34	fsociety	currently on funtoo
2016-01-21 14:48:35	rocx	I've been fed up with how XBPS breaks.
2016-01-21 14:48:57	fsociety	void is just a bit too young for my liking
2016-01-21 14:49:01	fsociety	i prefer MILF linux distros
2016-01-21 14:49:05	adam	hah
2016-01-21 14:49:13	rocx	Slackware?
2016-01-21 14:49:38	rocx	Debian?
2016-01-21 14:49:41	fsociety	i'd say slackware, but i like some dependency help
2016-01-21 14:49:54	fsociety	well im currently on a gentoo-based distro.. so
2016-01-21 14:50:01	rocx	If Void breaks, I'm either going FreeBSD or Funtoo.
2016-01-21 14:50:09	fsociety	yeah im funtoo
2016-01-21 14:50:15	fsociety	its gentoo without all the breakages
2016-01-21 14:50:24	adam	i also heard it's pretty...
2016-01-21 14:50:25	adam	...

2016-01-21 14:51:12	fsociety	it then responds
2016-01-21 14:51:14	fsociety	"fuck off"
2016-01-21 14:51:15	rocx	And sudo insults you by default.
2016-01-21 14:51:24	rocx	It is on oBSD.
2016-01-21 14:51:27	adam	u dont 'ave prim n proper privliges you filthy wankah
2016-01-21 14:51:30	fsociety	or it installs the total opposite of what you want

2016-01-21 14:51:49	Wildefyr	fsociety : why not just try crux?

2016-01-21 14:53:42	fsociety	rocx: haha.. as part of the sign up you have to choose your favourite distro, shell and desktop environment and wear a badge
2016-01-21 14:53:42	rocx	Or "ARCH MASTER RACE GET OUT OF HERE UBUNTU LOSERS".
2016-01-21 14:53:49	rocx	fV:

2016-01-21 14:54:03	fsociety	so everyone knows what you are currently using
2016-01-21 14:54:13	fsociety	and jono bacon is doing the key note i think
2016-01-21 14:54:13	Wildefyr	but then I wanto go to it so I can be like
2016-01-21 14:54:17	rocx	What if I use BSD and am just here for the tech news?

2016-01-21 14:54:56	Wildefyr	even wmutils is only one part of my desktop now :)
2016-01-21 14:55:05	fsociety	Wildefyr: what are the other parts
2016-01-21 14:55:28	Wildefyr	lemonbar dmenu and a bunch of shell scripts
2016-01-21 14:55:42	Wildefyr	I also make heavily use of stuff like xprop xinput
2016-01-21 14:55:42	fsociety	i looked at rofi but i went back to dmneu2

2016-01-21 14:55:59	Wildefyr	a couple of other suckless tools to boot as well
2016-01-21 14:56:35	fsociety	i went back to bspwm only cause i like its tiling mechanism.. i thought about trying to integrate that into wmutils.. but i was too lazy
2016-01-21 14:57:02	fsociety	my other idea was to make a wrapper for wmutils in python or c++ for easy configuration
2016-01-21 14:57:22	rocx	adam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine
2016-01-21 14:57:29	Wildefyr	yeah that'd be cool
2016-01-21 14:57:38	rocx	We might finally have nine planets again!
2016-01-21 14:57:39	Wildefyr	wmutils is just a framework anyway
2016-01-21 14:57:46	fsociety	Wildefyr: exactly
2016-01-21 14:57:55	Wildefyr	fyre could be alot more automatic
2016-01-21 14:58:16	fsociety	so you could make the wrapper modular.. by adding in plugins and new scripts with relative ease
2016-01-21 14:58:21	Wildefyr	but I encourage people to clone and then syslink the scripts somewhere on their path and create their own fork
2016-01-21 14:58:27	fsociety	and people could contribute that way
2016-01-21 14:58:53	Wildefyr	that'd be interesting but not for me I feel like
2016-01-21 14:59:05	fsociety	Wildefyr: your scripts made me understand wmutils at least :)
2016-01-21 14:59:10	fsociety	And yeah, definetly not for you
2016-01-21 14:59:27	Wildefyr	wmutils is the purest form of a window manager you can get
2016-01-21 14:59:49	Wildefyr	thanks bro
2016-01-21 14:59:57	fsociety	i'll let you on a little secret Wildefyr.  I still use wmutils on my work machine :)
2016-01-21 15:00:06	Wildefyr	I still wanna look into tiling with binary tree
2016-01-21 15:00:08	Wildefyr	s
2016-01-21 15:00:10	Wildefyr	!!!
2016-01-21 15:00:15	Wildefyr	fsociety : naughty boy
2016-01-21 15:00:27	Wildefyr	but isn't it just the best!
2016-01-21 15:00:28	fsociety	if you can get tiling with binary tree in wmutils efficient. then boom - back on wmutils
2016-01-21 15:00:51	fsociety	its just fun to have that much control, been tempted to see how well wmutils integrates with bspwm
2016-01-21 15:00:54	Wildefyr	yh will probably have to actually learn C to do it efficiently
2016-01-21 15:01:36	fsociety	or steal bspwm code
2016-01-21 15:01:36	fsociety	haha
2016-01-21 15:02:05	Wildefyr	yeah I just don't know the theory behind it
2016-01-21 15:02:18	Wildefyr	once I know that I can probably write something myself
2016-01-21 15:02:30	adam	Planet Nine
2016-01-21 15:02:32	adam	might as well call it
2016-01-21 15:02:39	adam	im not gonna put u guys through this

2016-01-21 21:04:54	venam	they have an insane software that analyses memor and give 3D visualization

2016-01-22 02:09:05	adam	maybe im too oldschool for this new fangled world
2016-01-22 02:09:06	kirby	All I really want is double borders, might just patch dwm
2016-01-22 02:09:18	@xero	yh, the usb ethernet adapter is stupid slow

2016-01-22 03:23:40	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : or you know, could just use mpv for everything
2016-01-22 03:24:03	Wildefyr	instead of using a million different programs for very similar media
2016-01-22 03:25:22	@xero	meow

2016-01-22 03:26:57	Pr0Wolf29	mpv disappeats after the gif plays
2016-01-22 03:27:01	Wildefyr	what *don't* you agree with?
2016-01-22 03:27:11	seth	new macs have a 3.5mm jack
2016-01-22 03:27:18	Wildefyr	use --loop-file Pr0Wolf29 
2016-01-22 03:27:18	seth	1 usb C, 1 3.5mm
2016-01-22 03:27:24	Wildefyr	or -loop for a playlist
2016-01-22 03:27:35	adam	oh shit we have 3 members
2016-01-22 03:27:37	Pr0Wolf29	okay what if I don't want it to loop. What if I want it to just stay there?
2016-01-22 03:27:43	@xero	i like mpd
2016-01-22 03:27:48	@xero	and ncmpcpp
2016-01-22 03:27:56	seth	>2016
2016-01-22 03:27:58	Wildefyr	? what do you mean
2016-01-22 03:28:10	seth	>using media-playing software on the desktop
2016-01-22 03:28:16	Wildefyr	you can pause it like anyother video
2016-01-22 03:28:19	Pr0Wolf29	I want it to just stay open and do nothing after playing
2016-01-22 03:28:33	adam	nothing beats a nice solid music library on a good ol' fashioned hard drive
2016-01-22 03:28:37	adam	i mean why else does bit torrent exist
2016-01-22 03:28:41	@xero	adam++
2016-01-22 03:28:45	Pr0Wolf29	I'm going to need an image viewer anyways for sorting through the files.
2016-01-22 03:28:45	Wildefyr	lol why would you want that
2016-01-22 03:28:50	Pr0Wolf29	Because it's nice.
2016-01-22 03:28:52	seth	except, you know, then you have to manage your library
2016-01-22 03:28:56	Wildefyr	gifs always loop lol
2016-01-22 03:29:05	@xero	>manage your library
2016-01-22 03:29:10	adam	not that hard
2016-01-22 03:29:14	Wildefyr	even mpv exits when you reach the end of a file on a video
2016-01-22 03:29:14	@xero	you make cp from to ?
2016-01-22 03:29:16	seth	yeah man, I used to rename files based on tags
2016-01-22 03:29:18	adam	not really sure what that even means
2016-01-22 03:29:25	seth	make sure there's albumart.jpg in each album
2016-01-22 03:29:28	seth	organize by year
2016-01-22 03:29:43	adam	ah well im not extremely draconian so i dont mind much
2016-01-22 03:29:53	Pr0Wolf29	Considering the fact I've advocated using mpv as a replacement for a music player, I'm surprised people are telling me of all people I'm not using mpv enough.
2016-01-22 03:30:02	@xero	seth: beets does all that for me if i need it
2016-01-22 03:30:11	seth	my structure was /music/[A-Z]/Artist/(YYYY) Album/## - title.mp3
2016-01-22 03:30:16	seth	gotta be consistent
2016-01-22 03:30:22	*	xero skoffs
2016-01-22 03:30:37	seth	**only** mp3 v0 or 320
2016-01-22 03:30:42	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : i use mpv for everything
2016-01-22 03:30:45	adam	i order mine by filetype cause im a fucking hipster
2016-01-22 03:30:52	Wildefyr	if it's media mpv is the right tool
2016-01-22 03:30:55	adam	~/aio/flac
2016-01-22 03:30:59	adam	~/aio/mp3
2016-01-22 03:31:02	seth	ew
2016-01-22 03:31:05	adam	fuck you i use unix
2016-01-22 03:31:09	@xero	kekl
2016-01-22 03:31:10	seth	I'd rather find things by the artist
2016-01-22 03:31:17	seth	you know, organized into a catalog
2016-01-22 03:31:26	seth	I don't want to remember if I stole it in FLAC or MP3
2016-01-22 03:31:37	adam	i mean id organize artist after filetpye
2016-01-22 03:31:41	@xero	i just cue the playlist i want. (i have one for ever album / genera)
2016-01-22 03:31:47	Wildefyr	I just list by Artists/Complilations/Random/Soundtracks/Mixes
2016-01-22 03:31:50	adam	so id have ~/aio/flac/nujabes and then also ~/aio/mp3/nujabes
2016-01-22 03:31:53	adam	or somethin like that
2016-01-22 03:31:58	seth	what I'm trying to say is
2016-01-22 03:32:02	seth	google music is worth 9$ a month
2016-01-22 03:32:07	Wildefyr	pls
2016-01-22 03:32:10	Wildefyr	9$
2016-01-22 03:32:11	@xero	pls
2016-01-22 03:32:12	adam	BUT ITS NOT YOUR MUSIC
2016-01-22 03:32:16	seth	it is my music
2016-01-22 03:32:16	adam	YOU DONT HAVE IT
2016-01-22 03:32:16	Wildefyr	I'm broke nigger
2016-01-22 03:32:17	adam	i want it
2016-01-22 03:32:19	Wildefyr	I'm broke
2016-01-22 03:32:20	seth	yes you can
2016-01-22 03:32:21	Pr0Wolf29	No. mpv doesn't have features that make sorting images easy.
2016-01-22 03:32:24	seth	you can listen to it offline
2016-01-22 03:32:27	seth	on any device
2016-01-22 03:32:28	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : like?
2016-01-22 03:32:35	seth	you can upload 50,000 **of your own songs**
2016-01-22 03:32:35	adam	can you have the actual file
2016-01-22 03:32:36	@xero	still not users
2016-01-22 03:32:42	@xero	you're "renting" music that way
2016-01-22 03:32:46	Pr0Wolf29	Being able to copy the file name from mpv itself
2016-01-22 03:32:48	seth	if you haven't purchased it, the files are not available to you
2016-01-22 03:32:54	Wildefyr	??
2016-01-22 03:32:57	seth	but you can "pin" aka cache them
2016-01-22 03:32:58	adam	because there really is nothing that beats the flexibility of having each file to do what you want with
2016-01-22 03:32:59	Wildefyr	not sure why you need that
2016-01-22 03:33:13	seth	anything you purchase is yours to keep
2016-01-22 03:33:15	Wildefyr	if you're using coreutils whatever, file browser whatever
2016-01-22 03:33:21	seth	anything you add to library is available to listen to as long as you pay
2016-01-22 03:33:26	Pr0Wolf29	So I can add it to a jobilfe that'll move it to a folder I want when I'm done sorting my images.
2016-01-22 03:33:27	@xero	Wildefyr: i copy image file names alot from my viewer
2016-01-22 03:33:33	seth	anything you upload is available to listen to if you don't pay
2016-01-22 03:33:39	Wildefyr	meh
2016-01-22 03:33:47	@xero	when you're in a huge dir of randomly named files you're visually sorting though it's kinda important
2016-01-22 03:33:48	Pr0Wolf29	xero: What viewer you use?
2016-01-22 03:33:53	Pr0Wolf29	Yeah
2016-01-22 03:34:00	Wildefyr	you can always use my mpvc program
2016-01-22 03:34:12	@xero	feh (or viewnoir depending on use case)
2016-01-22 03:34:14	Wildefyr	it doesn't have formatting yet but you can pull the filename that way
2016-01-22 03:34:34	Wildefyr	there might be a way to bind a key in mpv though
2016-01-22 03:35:58	Wildefyr	well I asked in mpv
2016-01-22 03:36:05	Wildefyr	the devs are pretty active in there

2016-01-22 04:40:30	@xero	>bitching about terminal users
2016-01-22 04:40:56	rocx	i mean just use a simpler environment if you're going to do that.
2016-01-22 04:41:06	Wildefyr	er
2016-01-22 04:41:08	Wildefyr	yes?
2016-01-22 04:41:19	@xero	>terminal scrubs
2016-01-22 04:41:26	@xero	sounds like your talking shit to me
2016-01-22 04:41:34	rocx	no not like that. i still use a shell too.
2016-01-22 04:41:50	@xero	is there a gui emacs?
2016-01-22 04:41:56	@xero	like vim's ?
2016-01-22 04:42:07	Wildefyr	yeah
2016-01-22 04:42:22	rocx	an x11 one and a gtk2 one.
2016-01-22 04:42:50	rocx	all they really do is allow for more colors, a couple of other fancy things, and makes the menu bar (if you didn't inhibit it) clickable with a mouse.
2016-01-22 04:43:21	@xero	was just curious
2016-01-22 04:43:46	rocx	i just use the gtk one for the colors and the ability to have color themes change better when i load one ad-hoc.
2016-01-22 04:44:54	rocx	but i will give someone flak for using gvim as opposed to vim in a terminal.
2016-01-22 04:45:16	@xero	classic hypocrisy
2016-01-22 04:45:26	rocx	it keeps the world a turnin'.

2016-01-22 05:08:50	seth	the whole cluster in one template?
2016-01-22 05:09:12	seth	that's awesome though
2016-01-22 05:09:22	@xero	iirc that's what corey is working on now

2016-01-22 05:11:37	seth	it just makes life easier :)
2016-01-22 05:11:51	@z3bra	the purpose here is to test my new distro
2016-01-22 05:11:57	@z3bra	not to isolate an app
2016-01-22 05:12:49	@xero	vbox? or lxc?
2016-01-22 05:12:58	@xero	inb4 lxc
2016-01-22 05:13:13	@z3bra	I'm trying the "contain" app
2016-01-22 05:13:26	@z3bra	but yeah, I'll end up with lxc I guess

2016-01-22 05:40:18	@z3bra	gentoo's wiki is soooo much usefull than the arch one
2016-01-22 05:40:22	@z3bra	let's be honest here
2016-01-22 05:40:28	@z3bra	arch wiki sucks now
2016-01-22 05:40:37	@z3bra	it has become to systemd specific
2016-01-22 05:40:41	rocx	Indeed.
2016-01-22 05:41:26	@z3bra	i'm on crux > lxc doesn't work > go to gentoo wiki
2016-01-22 05:41:38	@z3bra	and now everything is specified, even the kernel options needed
2016-01-22 05:41:42	@z3bra	on arch?
2016-01-22 05:41:54	@z3bra	they explain which systemd file you need

2016-01-22 06:02:08	seth	I like the arch wiki. I guess it's aimed at people migrating from sysv to systemd, cause it's fine for me
2016-01-22 06:02:43	@xero	rocx: why does cgo show all the ^M ?

2016-01-22 06:03:01	@xero	nvm
2016-01-22 06:04:39	rocx	xero: Because it's raw and not put through a filter function yet.
2016-01-22 06:04:44	rocx	It's a learning process.
2016-01-22 06:05:53	seth	writing a lisp gopher client, rocx?
2016-01-22 06:06:23	rocx	Yeah.
2016-01-22 06:06:28	seth	that's pretty sweet
2016-01-22 06:06:39	seth	what's a "GET" request look like?

2016-01-22 06:06:59	@xero	;D
2016-01-22 06:07:03	rocx	As in a request for data?
2016-01-22 06:07:12	seth	HTTP is pretty simple, just send "GET /route HTTP\1.1" over TCP connection
2016-01-22 06:07:13	adam	does anyone know how to get pepperflash in chromium working manually

2016-01-22 06:07:17	adam	or am i just being dumb again
2016-01-22 06:07:26	seth	how are you specifying the route though?
2016-01-22 06:07:30	seth	or "route"
2016-01-22 06:07:58	seth	followed by \r\n\r\n
2016-01-22 06:07:59	@xero	adam: what's chrome://flash/
2016-01-22 06:08:02	*	rocx shrugs. The networking aspect's being done by the Lisp environment. He just calls to set up a stream connection.
2016-01-22 06:08:03	@xero	show you?
2016-01-22 06:08:24	adam	wha

2016-01-22 07:36:47	fro	http://www.oldschoolirc.com/scripts 
2016-01-22 07:36:56	fro	that one actually has a couple screenshots
2016-01-22 07:37:02	fro	like tunnelvision
2016-01-22 07:37:23	fro	http://www.oldschoolirc.com/images/tv.png 
2016-01-22 07:37:36	fro	because almost all of those are themes from old bitchx/epic scripts
2016-01-22 07:37:44	fro	or at least dudes that used to make them
2016-01-22 07:38:07	fro	but jircii sucks
2016-01-22 07:38:18	fro	i don't even want to try to load that up to see the themes
2016-01-22 07:38:19	fro	heh
2016-01-22 07:40:42	@xero	don't blame you there
2016-01-22 07:40:56	fro	there was this script called opal for mirc
2016-01-22 07:41:00	fro	such great themes
2016-01-22 07:41:06	fro	wish i still had that
2016-01-22 07:41:14	fro	i'd probably install linux + wine just to see those
2016-01-22 07:41:23	fro	and remake them for irssi or epic5
2016-01-22 07:42:07	@xero	remember "irc war scripts"
2016-01-22 07:42:07	@xero	lel
2016-01-22 07:42:11	fro	oh yeah
2016-01-22 07:42:17	@xero	ping nukes and udp flooders...
2016-01-22 07:42:19	fro	ice.bx
2016-01-22 07:42:28	fro	i miss those days too
2016-01-22 07:42:34	fro	when you could just winnuke someone
2016-01-22 07:42:44	@xero	oh, and we did ;D
2016-01-22 07:43:04	fro	things have spiraled into another direction these days
2016-01-22 07:43:13	fro	i appreciate that there's less of those exploits
2016-01-22 07:43:15	fro	but
2016-01-22 07:43:19	fro	that shit was fun
2016-01-22 07:43:28	fro	and now it's all about bandwidth too
2016-01-22 07:43:46	fro	can't even smurf now
2016-01-22 07:47:31	seth	I thought nowadays it's all death threats and ordering COD pizza to people's houses and SWAT'ing
2016-01-22 07:47:45	fro	it is i guess
2016-01-22 07:47:54	fro	that's worse heh
2016-01-22 07:48:06	seth	hivemind "groupthink" skiddie culture
2016-01-22 07:48:09	fro	i wouldn't do that to someone that i'd ddos honestly
2016-01-22 07:48:12	fro	that's too far imo
2016-01-22 07:48:26	@xero	yeah, i'd much rather get ping nuked off dial up, then a swat team at my door
2016-01-22 07:48:28	fro	you'd have to be a really terrible person for me to get personal like that
2016-01-22 07:48:34	seth	pretty much
2016-01-22 07:48:40	fro	that kinda stuff is ridiculous to me
2016-01-22 07:48:42	seth	it's that idiot 4chan groupthink bro culture
2016-01-22 07:48:58	seth	just migrated to twitch
2016-01-22 07:49:09	fro	and this is why i try to stay as anonymous as possible now
2016-01-22 07:49:09	seth	or maybe they hang out in /vg/ ?
2016-01-22 07:49:11	seth	I don't know
2016-01-22 07:49:14	seth	same here
2016-01-22 07:49:16	fro	because of these children
2016-01-22 07:49:20	fro	wild ass children
2016-01-22 07:49:24	fro	got no morals
2016-01-22 07:49:34	seth	'anonymous' as in this is my first name, but it's pretty uncommon :P
2016-01-22 07:49:35	paul	ass children? like, poop?
2016-01-22 07:49:38	fro	i would gladly take getting ddosed for weeks
2016-01-22 07:49:39	seth	pretty common**
2016-01-22 07:49:45	fro	but if you start fucking with my personal life
2016-01-22 07:49:49	fro	we're going to war
2016-01-22 07:50:13	seth	the thing about DDOS'ing someone's connection is that it's mostly DHCP anyway
2016-01-22 07:50:22	seth	you could just switch the mac address on the router and renew lease
2016-01-22 07:50:25	fro	ok
2016-01-22 07:50:28	fro	this thing is about to start
2016-01-22 07:50:33	fro	and people are reaidng over my shoulder

2016-01-22 08:16:59	fyr	it does!
2016-01-22 08:17:22	@z3bra	wmp 0 0 + wmp $x $y isn't that much of a showcase

2016-01-22 08:24:27	@z3bra	I just don't want this repo to have >50 scripts that use "more or less" wmutils

2016-01-24 10:38:50	arc	i know that
2016-01-24 10:38:56	henriqueleng	arc: not using glibc
2016-01-24 10:38:57	arc	i have various problems with gnu
2016-01-24 10:39:04	henriqueleng	sndio is nice too
2016-01-24 10:39:06	arc	henriqueleng: since when were you limited to glibc?
2016-01-24 10:39:13	arc	musl, uclibc exist
2016-01-24 10:39:24	fyr	I stick with gnu stuff because generally it 'werks' okay
2016-01-24 10:39:42	fyr	and I don't have the need to hipster enough to switch
2016-01-24 10:39:48	henriqueleng	arc: Yeah, on linux I almost only use musl, but support on BSD is bigger
2016-01-24 10:39:51	fyr	sure there is bloat but whatever
2016-01-24 10:40:03	fyr	they're small programs in comparision anyway generally
2016-01-24 10:40:32	fsociety	tbh, to become a good sys admin you have to become a master of the core gnu utils
2016-01-24 10:40:52	fsociety	cause that way no matter what unix variatian you use you have those tools at your disposal
2016-01-24 10:41:22	fyr	agreed
2016-01-24 10:41:26	henriqueleng	anyone here can solve a rubiks cube?

2016-01-24 10:42:16	fyr	but there is a pattern
2016-01-24 10:43:13	eldritch	I'm going to memorize an algorithm just to impress my peers with my ability to google shit, which some people confuse with being smart
2016-01-24 10:43:24	eldritch	It
2016-01-24 10:43:46	henriqueleng	Bought one yesterday, I'm really addicted to it
2016-01-24 10:44:27	henriqueleng	I'm just missing one algorithm to finish it
2016-01-24 10:45:11	henriqueleng	eldritch: True, rubiks cube is a lot of memorization
2016-01-24 10:50:35	rocx	eldritch: judging by how people can't seem to grasp the concept of superior search engines like ddg, no surprise people consider ability to search equal to smartness.
2016-01-24 10:50:57	adam	3 loads of laundry
2016-01-24 10:51:01	adam	suck it

2016-01-24 10:51:18	adam	to each their own then my friend
2016-01-24 10:51:21	eldritch	The only thing I don't like about ddg is how much of a PITA googling images on it is
2016-01-24 10:51:30	adam	!gi images query
2016-01-24 10:51:41	rocx	haven't had any issues there.
2016-01-24 10:51:42	eldritch	Also, I just referred to searching on a non-google search engine as googling. Language is weird.
2016-01-24 10:51:56	rocx	that's because people don't know of alternatives.
2016-01-24 10:52:16	rocx	and the majority that do refuse to acknowledge its superiority because they're loyal to the big g brand.
2016-01-24 10:52:31	eldritch	Google is full botnet. I don't trust them for a second.
2016-01-24 10:52:38	rocx	eldritch: wish more people agreed.

2016-01-24 10:55:41	arc	rocx: the hs i'm going to doesn't require you to have computers

2016-01-24 11:35:47	tm512	if you telnet or netcat into IRC, the format of received messages is like :nick!user@host privmsg #channel :stuff
2016-01-24 11:35:49	fro	it's chaos
2016-01-24 11:36:02	eldritch	I feel like trying to use ii just to lengthen my epeen
2016-01-24 11:36:09	dcat	that's correct tm512

2016-01-24 11:38:40	dcat	z3bra ?
2016-01-24 11:38:48	@z3bra	ok so far, I can boot a container, setup the network, git clone a repo, cd into it, and compile it by running "make"
2016-01-24 11:38:56	@z3bra	(using pcc, of course)
2016-01-24 11:39:09	@z3bra	(and statically)
2016-01-24 11:39:46	dcat	that's all fine and dandy
2016-01-24 11:39:53	dcat	but a more pressing matter is at hand
2016-01-24 11:40:00	dcat	you need to try `crawl`.
2016-01-24 11:40:06	@z3bra	what's thaT?
2016-01-24 11:40:08	adam	and appreciate dcat's work
2016-01-24 11:40:17	@z3bra	I like the name already
2016-01-24 11:40:24	dcat	awesome rougelike
2016-01-24 11:40:37	@z3bra	how do I play?
2016-01-24 11:40:49	adam	anyways im gonna check out this config just a heads up guys in case you wanted to know
2016-01-24 11:40:49	dcat	just  do the tutorial

2016-01-24 11:41:02	dcat	download it
2016-01-24 11:41:04	dcat	run crawl
2016-01-24 11:41:12	@z3bra	how do I download it?
2016-01-24 11:41:14	dcat	and use arrow keys to navigate to tutorial
2016-01-24 11:41:20	tm512	also, whether or not IRC bots are stereotypical or not is kind of irrelevant. you can't deny that writing one from scratch involves knowledge about the IRC protocol
2016-01-24 11:41:24	@z3bra	man you need to learn how to go straigh to the point
2016-01-24 11:41:28	@z3bra	:P
2016-01-24 11:41:42	rocx	tm512: unless you use ii.
2016-01-24 11:41:43	fro	tm512: you were still wrong
2016-01-24 11:41:47	fro	so none of this matters
2016-01-24 11:42:07	rocx	then you don't need to know jack squart about the protocol just sign it into your favorite networks and channels and unlesh the havoc.
2016-01-24 11:42:30	tm512	using ii would not be "from scratch"
2016-01-24 11:42:38	rocx	then use dcat's irc library.
2016-01-24 11:42:46	dcat	"library"
2016-01-24 11:42:47	dcat	lel
2016-01-24 11:42:56	rocx	yeah, using the term loosely.
2016-01-24 11:43:06	dcat	and rocx, you have to understand the protocol to use it
2016-01-24 11:43:11	rocx	oh.
2016-01-24 11:43:17	rocx	at least it's not a python crap.
2016-01-24 11:44:03	rocx	import ircbot ... iot = signIn("irc.iotek.org", "#nixers") ... iot.Say("heh")
2016-01-24 11:45:37	tm512	you guys just seemed to think I was bragging or trying to show off or something when I said that I had written an IRC bot before
2016-01-24 11:45:48	dcat	no no no
2016-01-24 11:45:49	tm512	I'm not saying that it's any big accomplishment or anything
2016-01-24 11:45:52	dcat	we're just fucking around

2016-01-24 11:50:31	fro	like how it looks when someone messages you
2016-01-24 11:50:43	tm512	it's just that it would be a hard script to fuck up

2016-01-24 11:51:38	tm512	all it's doing is "<nick> message", so it spitting out what looked like it could be part of an IRC protocol message, threw me off

2016-01-24 15:30:33	@fro	something incredibly generic

2016-01-25 20:39:16	Roonix	lol I'm the same, I put everything off until the last possible minute :D
2016-01-25 20:39:22	thang1	it always backfires on me
2016-01-25 20:39:32	thang1	I have a really huge programming assignment due for artificial intelligence
2016-01-25 20:39:41	thang1	haven't started... I'm planning on doing it in haskell ._.
2016-01-25 20:40:52	thang1	then there's quantum physics... and then a project for database systems ;-;
2016-01-25 20:41:02	thang1	oh yeah and like 3 days worth of piled up jewish literature
2016-01-25 20:41:04	thang1	fml
2016-01-25 20:41:25	Roonix	jewish literature?
2016-01-25 20:42:15	thang1	yeah, it's a class. I'm not at a jewish college or anything it's just a literature class focused on jewish lit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2016-01-25 20:42:35	Roonix	ahh I see
2016-01-25 20:45:48	Roonix	Jewish literature doesn't sound quite as interesting as quantum physics :D
2016-01-25 20:46:02	thang1	yeah, it's not. I like quantum physics though, and I like the jewish lit teacher so it works out
2016-01-25 20:47:48	Roonix	shame they wouldn't allow Einstein writings on quantum theory to be classed as Jewish literature :D
2016-01-25 20:48:02	thang1	hah, that's not the kinda jewish lit they want to focus on in class anyway 
2016-01-25 20:48:11	Roonix	^_^
2016-01-25 20:53:01	@z3bra	yay
2016-01-25 20:53:13	@z3bra	now I fully understand how containers works!
2016-01-25 20:53:19	@z3bra	(regarding the network stack)
2016-01-25 20:53:48	fyr	oohoo
2016-01-25 20:54:50	thang1	nice
2016-01-25 20:55:04	thang1	like docker containers or what? (sorry, not quite sure what you mean by network stack)
2016-01-25 20:56:42	@z3bra	more like lxc
2016-01-25 20:56:52	@z3bra	docker is an app-container system
2016-01-25 20:56:59	@z3bra	though it works the same
2016-01-25 20:57:31	@z3bra	by network stack, I mean giving network access to PIDs running inside a PID namespace
2016-01-25 20:57:37	@z3bra	(aka, container :P)
2016-01-25 20:58:05	thang1	ah got it
2016-01-25 20:58:11	thang1	kinda :p
2016-01-25 20:58:18	@z3bra	I've been using the "contain" utility from here to test: https://github.com/arachsys/containers
2016-01-25 20:58:39	thang1	oooh shiny
2016-01-25 20:58:56	@z3bra	it lets you run commands in a chrooted PID/User namespace
2016-01-25 20:58:58	thang1	why don't you use the systemd nspawn thingey? It works perfectly /s
2016-01-25 20:59:08	@z3bra	because I don't have systemd? :O
2016-01-25 20:59:10	@z3bra	:P
2016-01-25 20:59:23	thang1	lol I know, hence the "/s"
2016-01-25 20:59:27	@z3bra	also, it's meant for testing purpose
2016-01-25 20:59:29	thang1	you know what I need in my life?
2016-01-25 20:59:37	thang1	I want a split mechanical keyboard
2016-01-25 20:59:39	@z3bra	slaps
2016-01-25 20:59:41	thang1	that I can strap to my arms somehow
2016-01-25 20:59:43	@z3bra	oh
2016-01-25 20:59:54	thang1	so like I can just recline in a chair and put a projector on the wall
2016-01-25 21:00:01	thang1	and manipulate shit with just the keyboard :D
2016-01-25 21:00:16	thang1	strap a trackball mouse on there somehow and jizz from the amazingness of it all
2016-01-25 21:00:24	thang1	s/chair/beanbag/
2016-01-25 21:00:58	thang1	or pace the floor and angrily pound on my wrist-attached keyboard thingeys as I type out a rant-mail to the morons in IT here
2016-01-25 21:08:27	@z3bra	haha

2016-01-26 11:30:56	xcelq	rocx: i was trolling but yeah it wouldn't surprise me
2016-01-26 11:30:56	eldritch	so apparently using the program "colors" from any directory other than the one its installed in results in my terminals crashing
2016-01-26 11:30:58	eldritch	neat
2016-01-26 11:31:05	xcelq	LOL
2016-01-26 11:31:46	xcelq	don't you love stupid programmer errors?
2016-01-26 11:31:52	xcelq	like how did you not overlook that
2016-01-26 11:32:07	eldritch	I don't think this is a stupid programmer error, given that z3bra uses it and never has problems
2016-01-26 11:32:14	eldritch	I think I just have some extremely obscure problem
2016-01-26 11:32:41	rocx	or it could've been tailored to his system.

2016-01-26 11:33:26	eldritch	like 90% of my various scripts and hacks are kludgy abominations that i created by ripping off z3bras scripts and then trying to make them work on my machine

2016-01-26 11:38:41	xcelq	eldritch: you mean like zealots?
2016-01-26 11:39:13	eldritch	imagine fundamentalist christians except instead of asking for your money and hating gay people they ask you not to give anyone money and hate everyone who uses computers
2016-01-26 11:39:28	xcelq	yeah that is annoying
2016-01-26 11:39:51	xcelq	or to only use fsf approved hardware /software

2016-02-08 22:29:00	mort_	how are you
2016-02-08 22:29:10	kirby	Good thanks
2016-02-08 22:29:20	mort_	good.
2016-02-08 22:31:15	kirby	Got to finish a load of design documents and crap for Software Engineering by the end of the week ;-;
2016-02-08 22:31:28	kirby	It's a group project and we're just bs'ing the methodology.
2016-02-08 22:31:34	mort_	:(
2016-02-08 22:32:03	mort_	I'm currently in a lecture about rationalism vs empiricism and a bunch of philosophers 
2016-02-08 22:32:13	kirby	lolwat why
2016-02-08 22:32:34	mort_	idk, norway has decided everyone in university should go through a philosophy course
2016-02-08 22:32:42	kirby	Man that sucks
2016-02-08 22:32:45	mort_	mhm
2016-02-08 22:32:55	mort_	aristotle was apparently mostly wrong
2016-02-08 22:36:11	kirby	We had Philosophy as an optional last year
2016-02-08 22:36:24	kirby	My friend went to the intro lecture and said they finished with "what is a chair?"
2016-02-08 22:36:27	kirby	He never went back.
2016-02-08 22:36:59	mort_	we had a lecture a couple weeks ago about the difference between how a snowman grows and how a human grows
2016-02-08 22:37:28	mort_	that a snowman grows by external forces, while humans grow by themselves
2016-02-08 22:37:32	mort_	not entirely sure what the point was
2016-02-08 22:37:46	kirby	Psudeo-intellectualism?
2016-02-08 22:37:51	kirby	:P
2016-02-08 22:37:56	mort_	lol, maybe

2016-02-08 23:23:44	mort_	this is getting kind of annoying
2016-02-08 23:24:01	@z3bra	why do you upgrade the kernel then?
2016-02-08 23:25:29	mort_	because it's easier to just pacman -Syu, and really, I prioritize being on the newest kernel over not having to spend a little time tethering my phone to my computer and running the command which fixes wifi every once in a while

2016-02-08 23:26:32	@z3bra	best of both worlds.
2016-02-08 23:27:06	mort_	fry: if I wanted to not be on the latest everything, I wouldn't be using arch, so I do indeed welcome the world of being "pushed around by the developers" (e.g using the latest version of their software)
2016-02-08 23:27:08	@z3bra	(or you could make use of the pacman hooks)
2016-02-08 23:28:09	mort_	as I said though, I prioritize being on the newest kernel over not having to spend a little time tethering my phone to my computer and running the command which fixes wifi every once in a while
2016-02-08 23:28:30	@z3bra	hence why I proposed pacman hooks
2016-02-08 23:28:49	@z3bra	aka "run an arbitrary command when something special happens"
2016-02-08 23:29:04	@z3bra	eg, fixing your wifi when the kernel gets upgraded
2016-02-08 23:29:24	mort_	that sounds sane

2016-02-08 23:49:52	+dcat	since you start with P1OUT as 1
2016-02-08 23:50:06	thang1	My school does ARM assembly every year and we often use those for final projects (or at least we did last year). I'd love to be able to ~~steal~~ use that as some examples for friends. I already had to go through all the pain and shit myself :|
2016-02-08 23:50:07	+dcat	and cause of P1OUT ^= 0b1000001;
2016-02-08 23:50:17	thang1	but of course we never used C, we had to go straight pure MIPS assembly :p
2016-02-08 23:50:25	+dcat	it'll constantly toggle between 0b1000000 and 0b0000001

2016-02-08 23:59:08	%vypr	https://store.ti.com/MSP-EXP430G2-MSP430-LaunchPad-Value-Line-Development-kit-P2031.aspx
2016-02-08 23:59:11	%vypr	?
2016-02-09 00:00:23	+dcat	yup
2016-02-09 00:08:54	thang1	it's pretty awesome actually
2016-02-09 00:09:12	%vypr	can you use other addons besides the boosterpacks?
2016-02-09 00:09:17	%vypr	the answer is yes
2016-02-09 00:09:20	thang1	really hard to find a better kit for cheaper. Especially when you factor in documentation. Nobody wants a $5 POS chinese shit with no english documentation
2016-02-09 00:09:24	%vypr	but in terms of what i mean
2016-02-09 00:09:36	%vypr	is: is it difficult to add other things to it?
2016-02-09 00:09:39	%vypr	like LCD screens, etc
2016-02-09 00:10:42	%vypr	im a noob to this so forgive me
2016-02-09 00:15:01	+dcat	vypr: depends on the interface
2016-02-09 00:16:04	+dcat	if it's SPI, probably not
2016-02-09 00:16:50	+dcat	keep in mind that you won't have as many pins as on the atmega328 (arduino)
2016-02-09 00:17:04	+dcat	so if you wanna attach a ton of stuff, it'll be harder
2016-02-09 00:17:16	%vypr	mhmm
2016-02-09 00:24:11	thang1	I fukking hate doing homework without an eraser
2016-02-09 00:24:18	thang1	why the fuck did I forget my eraser in the lab anyway -_-
2016-02-09 00:24:55	mort_	You mean like
2016-02-09 00:25:04	mort_	The backspace key fell off?
2016-02-09 00:25:13	+dcat	lel
2016-02-09 00:25:32	+dcat	>using old world tech
2016-02-09 00:25:35	+dcat	nigga pls
2016-02-09 00:26:18	thang1	it's not economical to write my physics homework in LaTeX lol
2016-02-09 00:26:32	thang1	you know how many fukking psi's and shit with gigantic fractions I have to write?
2016-02-09 00:26:37	stark	> not vim'ing in reality
2016-02-09 00:26:54	thang1	Although I suppose I could just make macros of all the most common equations and abuse mathematica's export to LaTeX function...
2016-02-09 00:27:19	mort_	You should
2016-02-09 00:27:53	thang1	too late now :p
2016-02-09 00:28:44	stark	dcat, what happened to dead.cat ?
2016-02-09 00:28:48	mort_	Why? Just scan it and write some software to convert it to LaTeX
2016-02-09 00:28:58	thang1	you have any idea how hard that is?
2016-02-09 00:29:30	thang1	I mean, even if my handwriting is perfect it's still stupidly hard. Like, it's very difficult to generate latex correctly given a scanned representation of latex generated math equations...
2016-02-09 00:29:40	thang1	never mind human handwriting lol
2016-02-09 00:30:00	mort_	Just get some neural networks 
2016-02-09 00:30:05	thang1	right
2016-02-09 00:30:32	+dcat	stark: dami took it down
2016-02-09 00:30:38	mort_	Strong AI should do it at least
2016-02-09 00:33:03	thang1	Oh strong AI of course
2016-02-09 00:33:05	thang1	why didn't I think of that
2016-02-09 00:33:19	thang1	I'll just write a simple program in C that writes a slightly better version of itself and then leave it on a loop
2016-02-09 00:33:27	thang1	when it becomes Jesus I'll ask it to do my homework for me /s
2016-02-09 00:33:38	mort_	Exactly

2016-02-09 04:50:47	rocx	or use whatever that f.lex port is called.

2016-02-09 05:34:48	fyr	DVI-I supports analogue connections, but you'll need to get an adapter for VGA to DVI-I
2016-02-09 05:35:12	ubuuu	why VGA?
2016-02-09 05:35:34	fyr	do you have a VGA monitor or not?

2016-02-09 05:38:16	fyr	yw buddy
2016-02-09 05:39:11	ubuuu	but you still cant connect a VGA into a dvi-i because the pins wont fit. unless you have some sort of adapter
2016-02-09 05:39:36	fyr	yes
2016-02-09 05:39:40	fyr	that's what I was saying
2016-02-09 05:39:58	ubuuu	owh okey sry i most have mistunderstood
2016-02-09 05:40:30	fyr	m a g i c a l
2016-02-09 05:45:30	boobah	he was saying that using a passive DVI/VGA adapter would be *possible*, not that the two would mate without such an interposer
2016-02-09 05:46:18	ubuuu	but i didnt mention VGA so i was confused 
2016-02-09 05:46:37	boobah	all good :)
2016-02-09 05:47:09	ubuuu	btw does dvi provide better quality or same?
2016-02-09 05:47:58	fyr	analogue does depend on the cable quality
2016-02-09 05:48:09	fyr	digital there's no difference between cables
2016-02-09 05:48:32	fyr	all in all you'll never notice a difference between digital cables, ever.
2016-02-09 05:48:59	boobah	what fyr said. VGA usually looks like shit on LCDs with a resolution higher than 800x600.
2016-02-09 05:49:29	boobah	not to mention that most VGA cables bundled nowadays have nearly *no* shielding, compared to the thicker cables that used to be the norm when CRTs dominated
2016-02-09 05:49:58	fyr	those cheapskates!
2016-02-09 05:50:41	boobah	not to mention that display auto-configuration is usually much smoother through purely digital interfaces like dvi, hdmi and dp
2016-02-09 05:51:11	boobah	it's quite easy to drive a vga display at the wrong resolution and refresh rate, and you have to "auto adjust" the picture and all that shit
2016-02-09 05:51:34	boobah	tl;dr: use digital display interfaces. it's 2016 (:
2016-02-09 05:53:04	boobah	i had an interesting fiasco over this past weekend with my monitor being driven 0.1 Hz too low by Xorg, and it was causing artifacts. really frustrating, and it took me way too long to pinpoint the problem.
2016-02-09 05:53:36	boobah	i was so scared that either my monitor or graphics card were dying
2016-02-09 05:54:22	fyr	nah just X11 fucking with you
2016-02-09 05:54:27	fyr	like it fucks with us all
2016-02-09 05:54:30	ubuuu	haha 
2016-02-09 05:54:36	fyr	still better than waylame though
2016-02-09 05:56:10	ubuuu	my monitor did follow with a VGA but i accidently bought a DVI adapter but my monitor also had a DVI-D port so i just bought a cable and now im waiting for the cable to arrive
2016-02-09 05:56:52	boobah	lol
2016-02-09 05:57:29	ubuuu	and then i found about the dvi-d and dvi-i so i was more worried

2016-02-09 06:44:43	xyz	hahaha
2016-02-09 06:44:58	rocx	once you learn vi{m,} bindings, it's hard to let them go.
2016-02-09 06:45:08	rocx	and emacs's default navigation bindings are retarded.

2016-02-09 06:47:02	fyr	I don't think I could even quit emacs
2016-02-09 06:47:24	rocx	still need to learn my way around org-mode.
2016-02-09 06:47:44	xyz	i do use cabbage tho https://github.com/senny/cabbage
2016-02-09 06:48:19	rocx	> installation via `bash -c $(curl whatever/install.sh)`
2016-02-09 06:48:20	rocx	wow.
2016-02-09 06:48:36	rocx	then again, that's about as secure as just installing a package from your distro's repository.
2016-02-09 06:49:25	rocx	not a fan of "starter packs". i felt the best way to learn emacs was to run a search for how you want to control it and build an ~/.emacs.d from scratch.
2016-02-09 06:50:09	rocx	then find some other hosers' configurations on github, then read them.
2016-02-09 06:53:42	@xero	isn't that "how you do" all configs?
2016-02-09 06:53:59	wesbl	fyr: why emacs is better?
2016-02-09 06:54:04	rocx	sure. but i say it's much better to start from scratch and build up rather than have something pre-prepared.
2016-02-09 06:54:08	fyr	wesbl, never
2016-02-09 06:54:30	rocx	fyr: can you emulate vim in vim? 
2016-02-09 06:54:35	rocx	didn't think so. you can in emacs.
2016-02-09 06:54:36	wesbl	fyr: i mean, why do you prefer emacs?
2016-02-09 06:54:42	fyr	wesbl, I don't
2016-02-09 06:54:53	rocx	thus, emacs is superior.
2016-02-09 06:54:54	fyr	rocx, you can with neovim!
2016-02-09 06:55:06	rocx	neovim is for ninnies anyway.
2016-02-09 06:55:12	*	fyr shrugs
2016-02-09 06:55:16	wesbl	rocx: why superior?
2016-02-09 06:55:21	fyr	still better than elame
2016-02-09 06:55:37	@xero	vi vi vi
2016-02-09 06:55:39	rocx	because you can emulate vim and then some.
2016-02-09 06:57:19	rocx	eh i jest.
2016-02-09 06:57:34	rocx	i switched just to streamline my workflow into a program that's meant to.
2016-02-09 06:57:43	rocx	and because of SLIME for learning common lisp.
2016-02-09 07:01:14	+dcat	rocx: I changed my mind
2016-02-09 07:01:18	+dcat	no way I can do it

2016-02-09 07:01:37	+dcat	nah
2016-02-09 07:01:44	@xero	dcat++
2016-02-09 07:01:49	+dcat	I just can't take it
2016-02-09 07:01:54	rocx	alright then.
2016-02-09 07:02:12	+dcat	it seems like most people use it with "evil-mode"
2016-02-09 07:02:16	rocx	yep.
2016-02-09 07:02:25	rocx	well, at least i do.
2016-02-09 07:02:29	@xero	if i wanted that many chords id just play guitar
2016-02-09 07:02:32	+dcat	running emacs to emulate vi
2016-02-09 07:02:43	+dcat	I do run my shell in emacs mode though
2016-02-09 07:02:54	rocx	emacs is the environment. vi emulation is for editing.
2016-02-09 07:03:12	+dcat	mostly use ^A ^E ^[F ^[B and such
2016-02-09 07:03:30	rocx	those come in handy since i disable evil-mode just for erc/circe buffers.
2016-02-09 07:03:52	+dcat	for the non-nerdy people in here
2016-02-09 07:03:56	+dcat	^[ is alt/esc
2016-02-09 07:04:34	+dcat	and now a ton of people are gonna try using esc+<key> instead of alt+<key>
2016-02-09 07:04:58	rocx	that was the only way i could get irssi to work between channels.
2016-02-09 07:05:14	rocx	Esc+<key>.
2016-02-09 07:05:18	+dcat	in which term?
2016-02-09 07:05:34	rocx	think in all of them. mostly urxvt. didn't stay in st-xresources for long.
2016-02-09 07:05:59	rocx	https://github.com/rocx/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el#L51 and this part would come in handy when dealing with evil.
2016-02-09 07:06:06	+dcat	hrm
2016-02-09 07:06:13	+dcat	what was the problem with my fork?
2016-02-09 07:06:34	rocx	there wasn't a problem with it. i just didn't use it for long because that's when i made...
2016-02-09 07:06:36	rocx	...the switch.
2016-02-09 07:06:51	+dcat	to what?
2016-02-09 07:06:57	rocx	to emacs.
2016-02-09 07:07:00	@xero	to crack
2016-02-09 07:07:16	+dcat	just cause you use a shitty editor doesn't mean you need a shitty term though
2016-02-09 07:07:30	@xero	he uses the GUI EMACS
2016-02-09 07:07:38	rocx	gtk2 one.
2016-02-09 07:07:49	@xero	BURN THE HERETIC!!!!
2016-02-09 07:07:58	*	rocx activates the Absolute Safety Capsule.
2016-02-09 07:08:00	+dcat	oh god
2016-02-09 07:08:26	rocx	easier to choose what font i please and the colors can change more on a whim.
2016-02-09 07:08:30	rocx	and i'm not limited to 256 of them.
2016-02-09 07:08:49	@xero	rocx uses emacs to see colors
2016-02-09 07:09:05	rocx	MORE colors. rainbow-mode comes in handy when dealing with css.
2016-02-09 07:09:56	rocx	granted if i ran this editor my way, it'd be more of a scheme-based one (like guile emacs), and doesn't include two irc clients out of the box for starters.
2016-02-09 07:10:12	+dcat	hell
2016-02-09 07:10:15	rocx	no really i'm not going to pretend it's the holiest editor i ever used.
2016-02-09 07:10:18	+dcat	xterm can do truecolor
2016-02-09 07:10:24	+dcat	that's a shitty excuse
2016-02-09 07:10:30	rocx	but... that's xterm.
2016-02-09 07:10:48	rocx	for some reason i'm just not that big of a fan of the typical dumb terminal style anymore.
2016-02-09 07:11:26	@xero	http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1307/16688.html
2016-02-09 07:11:32	@xero	st supports true color as well
2016-02-09 07:12:01	rocx	huh. like i said, colors aren't the only reason.
2016-02-09 07:12:59	rocx	sometimes, graphics come in handy. not for 100% of the time but sometimes it helps. this is one reason i say plan 9 had the right idea to still keep the terminal and shell the primary interface, but make it flexible enough to do... gasp... GRAPHICS.
2016-02-09 07:13:17	fyr	I should look into st...
2016-02-09 07:13:23	fyr	been meaning to forever
2016-02-09 07:13:30	fyr	oh well too late to do so now
2016-02-09 07:13:34	fyr	gotta go bed
2016-02-09 07:13:41	@xero	fyr: good starting point: https://github.com/dcat/st-xresources
2016-02-09 07:13:50	rocx	yes. it's a good point to start.
2016-02-09 07:16:13	fyr	okay thanks guys

2016-02-09 07:28:13	rocx	just ask away.
2016-02-09 07:28:21	@xero	wesbl: z3bra 
2016-02-09 07:28:27	@xero	but yeah, just ask
2016-02-09 07:28:31	rocx	xero: does z3bra use vim or nvi?
2016-02-09 07:28:42	@xero	both/either
2016-02-09 07:28:48	@xero	he's my vim guru
2016-02-09 07:28:55	@xero	but much of that info is the same between editors
2016-02-09 07:29:10	rocx	except for plugins.
2016-02-09 07:29:13	rocx	and visual state.
2016-02-09 07:29:16	@xero	>much
2016-02-09 07:29:30	rocx	touche.
2016-02-09 07:30:13	wesbl	xero: why when i paste certain text it puts always on the first line? o_O
2016-02-09 07:30:37	@xero	:set paste
2016-02-09 07:30:37	@xero	???
2016-02-09 07:30:48	@xero	also
2016-02-09 07:31:01	@xero	paste from vim? or paste from clipbloard TO vim?
2016-02-09 07:31:56	wesbl	xero: no, from clipboard, but it happened only 2 times
2016-02-09 07:32:58	@xero	i'd say, make sure you're in insert mode, and in paste mode before you paste 
2016-02-09 07:36:51	xyz	so the hangover is real
2016-02-09 07:36:55	xyz	fucking a

2016-02-09 07:41:22	@z3bra	vis yeah
2016-02-09 07:41:32	@z3bra	the default conf is now sane enough
2016-02-09 07:41:41	@z3bra	and reliable enough
2016-02-09 07:45:03	@z3bra	I can still spot a few bugs here and there
2016-02-09 07:45:24	@z3bra	but Tanner fix them really quickly
2016-02-09 07:50:08	@z3bra	I just hope he's not gonna go the vim route, and try to implement as much as possible
2016-02-09 07:51:20	rocx	oh right. 
2016-02-09 07:51:43	rocx	are you pretty much taking over its development? just doing your own fork?
2016-02-09 07:53:11	@z3bra	nothing yet
2016-02-09 07:53:26	@z3bra	it works well enough for my usecase
2016-02-09 07:53:42	rocx	how's configuration going to work? just the `mg` route?
2016-02-09 07:53:54	@z3bra	config.h in this case
2016-02-09 07:53:58	rocx	:\
2016-02-09 07:54:31	@z3bra	to be fair, the default are extremely sane
2016-02-09 07:55:18	rocx	still.
2016-02-09 07:55:25	@z3bra	I'm starting to get tired of configuring things :P
2016-02-09 07:56:06	rocx	maybe having to deal with configuration headers finally got to ya.
2016-02-09 07:56:14	@z3bra	haha, maybe
2016-02-09 07:56:44	@z3bra	but no, in fact
2016-02-09 07:57:07	@z3bra	'cause I still configure st

2016-02-09 08:05:14	rocx	z3bra: i like lisp too much.
2016-02-09 08:05:18	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:05:20	boobah	rocx: you can make stuff in lisp if you wanted to
2016-02-09 08:05:28	rocx	i know but it won't quite be the same.
2016-02-09 08:06:03	boobah	z3bra: i feel ya, for sure. i've been wanting to make an editor for a while now, but it's surprisingly tough for someone who hasn't implemented efficient editable text buffers before
2016-02-09 08:06:27	@z3bra	I have NEVER used mmap before
2016-02-09 08:06:31	rocx	heck, i almost want to write my own emacs clone that doesn't suck.
2016-02-09 08:06:54	@z3bra	yaemacs
2016-02-09 08:06:55	@xero	dont make it an emacs clone then

2016-02-09 08:07:04	@z3bra	emax
2016-02-09 08:07:09	@xero	just make and editor that you thinks is "correct"
2016-02-09 08:07:13	rocx	adam: THAT'S PERFECT YOU'RE GETTING A PROMOTION!

2016-02-09 08:07:24	%adam	yay
2016-02-09 08:07:59	boobah	z3bra: yeah, mmap seems really useful for this type of thing. not to mention transparent kernel-level file-seek abstraction
2016-02-09 08:08:16	@z3bra	it's hard to get it right
2016-02-09 08:08:31	@z3bra	I used my first mmap recently "for real"
2016-02-09 08:08:33	@z3bra	like
2016-02-09 08:08:37	rocx	fffffffs. wow i forgot how much i hated java.
2016-02-09 08:08:38	boobah	rocx: i just went up in my scrollbuffer and read what you were saying about plan9 having the right idea with more flexible terminal-like interfaces
2016-02-09 08:08:46	@z3bra	in a program that I consider finished and that I use
2016-02-09 08:08:47	boobah	i have been thinking about this a lot lately
2016-02-09 08:08:59	boobah	z3bra: one we know?
2016-02-09 08:09:14	@z3bra	wendy
2016-02-09 08:09:18	rocx	boobah: heck, the new wave of editors for it don't have to be mouse-based. there would've still been a keyboard-exclusive clique even if it took off.
2016-02-09 08:09:24	boobah	ah, good ol wendy. love that thing.
2016-02-09 08:09:29	rocx	very handy,
2016-02-09 08:09:35	@z3bra	I changed it a lot
2016-02-09 08:09:36	boobah	rocx: YES
2016-02-09 08:09:38	@z3bra	well
2016-02-09 08:09:41	@z3bra	"a lot"
2016-02-09 08:09:57	boobah	rocx: I actually posted a few ideas relating to this on another forum. Lemme see if my post is still online
2016-02-09 08:10:10	@z3bra	aaah no
2016-02-09 08:10:13	@z3bra	that was in pm
2016-02-09 08:10:14	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:10:43	boobah	what do you mean?
2016-02-09 08:11:02	@z3bra	I mmap the file containing the list of files created
2016-02-09 08:11:10	@z3bra	'pm' is my pack manager
2016-02-09 08:12:14	boobah	ohhhh, gotcha. lol, i thought you were saying my post was a (p)rivate (m)essage. :)
2016-02-09 08:13:05	rocx	fffff. wow i really hate java now.
2016-02-09 08:13:19	@xero	ohhhh, gotcha. lol, i thought you were syaing my post as (P)ost (M)eridiem
2016-02-09 08:13:19	@z3bra	why did it took you so long?
2016-02-09 08:13:22	rocx	local class, creating an object of that class, "cannot find symbol" when compiling.
2016-02-09 08:13:50	rocx	yes, the object is compiled too.

2016-02-09 08:22:13	@z3bra	oh greduan 
2016-02-09 08:22:14	greduan	Especially in JS if I want to make it performant.
2016-02-09 08:22:16	boobah	greduan: tell us
2016-02-09 08:22:17	chc4	probably because youre writing it in a shit language
2016-02-09 08:22:22	chc4	just use atom
2016-02-09 08:22:25	@z3bra	btw I saw your question
2016-02-09 08:22:26	greduan	chc4: truly not a language for editors
2016-02-09 08:22:36	greduan	z3bra: cool
2016-02-09 08:22:45	@z3bra	to answer your question
2016-02-09 08:22:49	@z3bra	I think it's possible
2016-02-09 08:22:53	@z3bra	but
2016-02-09 08:22:57	@z3bra	I'm not sure
2016-02-09 08:23:04	greduan	cool
2016-02-09 08:23:08	@z3bra	I don't play wit the config much
2016-02-09 08:23:09	greduan	I'm just waiting for that Lua magic
2016-02-09 08:23:23	@z3bra	I hope this will not happen
2016-02-09 08:23:34	@z3bra	otherwise, this will become a shitty vim clone
2016-02-09 08:23:34	greduan	although if you want a text editor extendable in Lua, check out TextAdept
2016-02-09 08:23:41	@z3bra	with a shitons of plugins
2016-02-09 08:23:45	greduan	z3bra: the author is probably aware
2016-02-09 08:23:56	greduan	I just hope at some point I an define my own operators and motions/text-objects
2016-02-09 08:24:03	greduan	can*
2016-02-09 08:24:04	greduan	anyway
2016-02-09 08:24:20	@z3bra	 { "ap",                 ACTION(TEXT_OBJECT_PARAGRAPH)
2016-02-09 08:24:26	rocx	greduan: ZILE if you want lua.
2016-02-09 08:24:43	greduan	I thought ZILE was too basic to be extended?
2016-02-09 08:24:43	boobah	greduan: i started writing a terminal, shell and unix-like environment in JS. you'd be the guy interested.
2016-02-09 08:24:54	greduan	boobah: how the fuck? lol
2016-02-09 08:24:55	boobah	zile's old as hell, isn't it?
2016-02-09 08:24:56	rocx	i got no clue if it's even still being worked on.
2016-02-09 08:25:02	@z3bra	boobah, no we're not
2016-02-09 08:25:04	@z3bra	maaaan
2016-02-09 08:25:05	@z3bra	honestly
2016-02-09 08:25:06	@z3bra	JS
2016-02-09 08:25:11	greduan	lol
2016-02-09 08:25:14	greduan	My editor is being coded in Node.js, server-side JavaScript as you all probably know. This means it's FUCKING hard to manage memory because in JS I don't get access to that shit.
2016-02-09 08:25:20	rocx	i had to fiddle with JS for a project once and it was awful.
2016-02-09 08:25:24	greduan	You do NOT want to code a terminal in that shit
2016-02-09 08:25:27	greduan	Or a shell
2016-02-09 08:25:27	@xero	greduan thank you for becoming the resident js whipping boy. i dont miss it one bit.
2016-02-09 08:25:34	greduan	xero: lol
2016-02-09 08:25:38	greduan	they asked
2016-02-09 08:25:51	@xero	;D
2016-02-09 08:25:52	 < 	chc4 (chc4@Clk-90E2C44F.nycap.res.rr.com) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2016-02-09 08:25:56	boobah	greduan: i mean, i'm only a few hundred lines in. but it's kinda fun doing everything manually. just a fun project i can run in a browser
2016-02-09 08:26:05	rocx	well crap yet another CLASSPATH problem.
2016-02-09 08:26:07	greduan	Anyway, the concepts for my editor are way clearer now, will probably turn out similar to SAM (?), I need more research on that.
2016-02-09 08:26:13	greduan	boobah: cool
2016-02-09 08:26:14	greduan	got a repo?
2016-02-09 08:26:18	boobah	by manually i mean like using setInterval() to flash the terminal cursor, which itself is a <div> with a background color
2016-02-09 08:26:26	greduan	ah
2016-02-09 08:26:34	boobah	nah, not yet. i'll MSG you if/when
2016-02-09 08:26:35	greduan	so you're not actually doing a shell to the OS?
2016-02-09 08:27:07	@z3bra	./x86_64-spoink-linux-musl-cc hello.c
2016-02-09 08:27:08	@z3bra	eat that
2016-02-09 08:27:11	@z3bra	bithc
2016-02-09 08:27:33	boobah	yeah, i'm completely modularizing everything. jsterm is the terminal component, jsh is the shell, and i'm writing some commands as well as a basic filesystem interface
2016-02-09 08:27:58	greduan	damn son
2016-02-09 08:27:59	boobah	super high-level emulation of decently low-level stuff :)
2016-02-09 08:28:21	boobah	when you make a JSTerm object, you give it a JSH object to interact with
2016-02-09 08:28:33	greduan	ic
2016-02-09 08:28:36	boobah	it's kind of shit but still fun, because i'm not yet skilled to do this in C yet
2016-02-09 08:28:47	rocx	i can't even grasp pointers in c no matter how i try.
2016-02-09 08:28:50	greduan	I assure you if you want to do it right, it's way easier in C
2016-02-09 08:29:05	greduan	why do people have so much trouble with pointers in C? lol
2016-02-09 08:29:12	@z3bra	guys
2016-02-09 08:29:17	@xero	^^
2016-02-09 08:29:17	rocx	greduan: iunno.
2016-02-09 08:29:19	rocx	i just suck.
2016-02-09 08:29:20	greduan	is a pointer not just a reference to some point in memory?
2016-02-09 08:29:23	@z3bra	stop saying that you're not good enough in C
2016-02-09 08:29:26	rocx	yeah but it's mainly when to do them
2016-02-09 08:29:30	@z3bra	and start writing C
2016-02-09 08:29:32	boobah	pointers themselves aren't confusing, but it gets weird trying to visualize multiple layers of pointers in memory in your head
2016-02-09 08:29:33	greduan	^^
2016-02-09 08:29:46	greduan	^^ meant for z3bra 
2016-02-09 08:29:53	boobah	3zbra: i *am* writing things in C, lol. just not a terminal yet
2016-02-09 08:30:09	greduan	boobah: HA! That's what JS objects are like bro.
2016-02-09 08:30:10	rocx	i like lisp too much to go back.
2016-02-09 08:30:11	boobah	because that involves knowledge of the Linux API. I'm reading a book atm
2016-02-09 08:30:30	greduan	you should probably start with a command line command
2016-02-09 08:30:32	@z3bra	cross your fingers for me guys...
2016-02-09 08:30:40	boobah	greduan: true. i feel like JS is really complex but it's also pretty beginner-friendly. because i'm dumb as shit and can still make stuff with it
2016-02-09 08:30:45	@z3bra	trying to pack gcc right now
2016-02-09 08:30:45	*	xero crosses his fingers
2016-02-09 08:30:57	greduan	z3bra: Crossing my fingers in my mind.
2016-02-09 08:31:12	greduan	boobah: JS is stupid as fuck, but it has a couple good concepts which make it cool.
2016-02-09 08:31:32	boobah	greduan, z3bra: i've written simple implementations of things like cat, echo, tee, pwd, and some other custom utilities
2016-02-09 08:31:43	greduan	cool
2016-02-09 08:31:45	@z3bra	doesn't count
2016-02-09 08:31:49	@z3bra	:P
2016-02-09 08:31:51	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:31:56	@xero	kekl
2016-02-09 08:31:57	greduan	read the POSIX implementation to write a shell
2016-02-09 08:31:58	boobah	okay z3bra :D
2016-02-09 08:32:03	greduan	xero: kackle
2016-02-09 08:32:07	greduan	cackle*
2016-02-09 08:32:08	greduan	?
2016-02-09 08:32:14	@xero	yes, but w/ a kek'
2016-02-09 08:32:47	@z3bra	the thing that helped me a lot in C is using a library that's not standard
2016-02-09 08:32:54	@z3bra	typically, inotify for wendy
2016-02-09 08:33:03	greduan	BUT THEN THERE'S NO STACKOVERFLOW
2016-02-09 08:33:05	boobah	yeah, one of the current projects is a simple shell called psh (named after the "pssh" vocal interjection)
2016-02-09 08:33:13	greduan	psh, that's easy
2016-02-09 08:33:15	boobah	z3bra: like musl?
2016-02-09 08:33:15	greduan	:P
2016-02-09 08:33:22	@z3bra	no
2016-02-09 08:33:24	greduan	boobah: musl follows the standard to the T lol
2016-02-09 08:33:28	boobah	oh, non-POSIX?
2016-02-09 08:33:30	@z3bra	musl is a libc
2016-02-09 08:33:35	@z3bra	so it's standard
2016-02-09 08:33:46	boobah	it doesn't follow completely POSIX actually
2016-02-09 08:33:55	boobah	(i've heard)
2016-02-09 08:33:58	@z3bra	I mean using something like libgit, libinotify, libpng or something like that
2016-02-09 08:34:09	greduan	libgit
2016-02-09 08:34:10	greduan	GET TO IT
2016-02-09 08:34:22	@z3bra	something that will force you to get out of the scanf() + if/else + printf()
2016-02-09 08:34:35	boobah	okay. fair enough. most of my library use has been on microcontrollers to do things like send SPI packets. dcat probably has done stuff like this too.
2016-02-09 08:34:54	boobah	z3bra: 2not using direct read() and write() syscalls
2016-02-09 08:35:06	@xero	uughhh

2016-02-09 08:35:36	@xero	it's called quoting

2016-02-09 08:39:12	%adam	oh that reminds me
2016-02-09 08:39:21	boobah	ohh, sorry. just wanted to make sure you would eventually look at my paste. take your time, but i wanna know your opinion on this. just MSG me whenever
2016-02-09 08:39:24	%adam	when i exit the channel is there a message about a hotel
2016-02-09 08:39:32	boobah	yes
2016-02-09 08:39:36	%adam	hell yeah

2016-02-09 08:40:27	%adam	i mean i may have boasted a bit but i enjoy learning about the system
2016-02-09 08:40:31	greduan	Hey do you know the inner workings of SAM?
2016-02-09 08:40:37	%adam	partially
2016-02-09 08:40:39	%adam	theres 2 parts to sam
2016-02-09 08:40:43	greduan	server and client?
2016-02-09 08:40:46	%adam	basically
2016-02-09 08:40:51	@xero	master and slave
2016-02-09 08:40:59	greduan	xero: in terms of processes
2016-02-09 08:41:04	%adam	the server is merely an engine that parses the ed-like commands
2016-02-09 08:41:13	*	xero cracks the whip on greduan 
2016-02-09 08:41:20	%adam	and then the client is "downloaded" into the current term window and thats the actual graphical interface

2016-02-09 08:43:13	boobah	i think that would be a feature of your client?
2016-02-09 08:43:25	greduan	I need to study the server end way more.

2016-02-09 09:11:54	S0lll0s	i know
2016-02-09 09:12:09	@xero	just sharing my opinion man
2016-02-09 09:12:23	S0lll0s	what I find a bit difficult is that a lot of FOSS projects rely completely on github for hosting and representation
2016-02-09 09:12:32	S0lll0s	xero: sorry that came off very wrong
2016-02-09 09:13:15	paul	For smaller FOSS projects, yes
2016-02-09 09:13:40	paul	but larger, more established FOSS projects have their own system
2016-02-09 09:13:43	@xero	imo using any corp to back OS work seems wrong. if you want to be indy be all indy and run your own git server like savannah

2016-02-09 09:54:40	@xero	i'd say the font you're using doesnt provide those sets
2016-02-09 09:54:48	@xero	did you try another font/
2016-02-09 09:54:48	@xero	?
2016-02-09 09:54:49	arc	it happens with every single font i try
2016-02-09 09:54:57	arc	the only one that appears to work is fixed
2016-02-09 09:55:03	arc	i'm using neep
2016-02-09 09:56:47	boobah	rc: neep doesn't have a unicode set, only iso8859 if i remember right
2016-02-09 09:56:51	boobah	arc
2016-02-09 09:57:03	boobah	fixed provides iso10646
2016-02-09 09:57:24	arc	well fuck
2016-02-09 09:57:58	boobah	that's why i stopped using neep about three years ago, but I would think it should still work with thingmenu
2016-02-09 09:58:51	arc	oh well
2016-02-09 09:58:58	arc	i guess it's only a menu for a link opener script
2016-02-09 09:58:58	@xero	you can try 9menu
2016-02-09 09:59:02	arc	doesn't matter much

2016-02-09 10:15:19	greduan	from some Ruby company?
2016-02-09 10:16:27	boobah	wondered what your setup's like. i usually just use the chromium debugger, because the interpretter's pretty nice, but is there something lighter i could be using?
2016-02-09 10:17:09	greduan	I do backend
2016-02-09 10:17:25	greduan	don't often se Chromium
2016-02-09 10:18:02	boobah	so it's all through node, then?
2016-02-09 10:18:16	boobah	how do you debug web-client scripts?
2016-02-09 10:18:29	boobah	such as the /client repo on noedit
2016-02-09 10:20:16	greduan	that's on the CLI
2016-02-09 10:20:20	greduan	but I didn't get too far on the client
2016-02-09 10:22:15	greduan	in fact in code I haven't gotten far at all
2016-02-09 10:22:17	boobah	so you like run `node-something file.js` and see if it spits out errors? curious how this works

2016-02-09 10:26:48	greduan	boobah: pretty much. you usually setup a logger and monitor that if your app is bigger.
2016-02-09 10:27:07	rocx	come to think of it, the current web standards are what's bringing us down.
2016-02-09 10:31:16	boobah	rocx: another thing i've been thinking about. my current idea is to write an awesome interface around the netsurf library. whatdya think?
2016-02-09 10:31:37	boobah	greduan: interesting. node looks cool.
2016-02-09 10:31:45	rocx	oh man i keep forgetting about netsurf.
2016-02-09 10:33:10	rocx	why can't more laptops and keyboards come with the trackpoint thing in the center?
2016-02-09 10:33:25	boobah	it's the only thing i've found that supports even html4
2016-02-09 10:33:38	rocx	html5's the new semantic alternative.
2016-02-09 10:33:39	boobah	which sucks, but i could live with it for a few years
2016-02-09 10:34:05	rocx	frankly, it kind of helps me structure in my head better when the tags are <article> rather than <div id="article">.
2016-02-09 10:34:15	boobah	i think the only laptops that still have it are a few dells and obviously thinkpads
2016-02-09 10:34:42	boobah	i'm with you, but all html5 engines are bloated as shit.

2016-02-09 10:50:03	rocx	it's like you can't get one with a decent processor without getting the biggest hard disk imaginable.
2016-02-09 10:50:08	boobah	just found out about servo 2 days ago. might check it out before it gets bloated too (if it isn't already, which I suspect, although the performance stats look great)

2016-02-09 11:35:44	boobah	i basically did `ls() { ls | blah; }` and then ran `ls`. i'm so dumb.
2016-02-09 11:36:29	boobah	i should have called `ls` as `env ls`
2016-02-09 11:38:03	greduan	!ls
2016-02-09 11:38:07	greduan	that runs the original iirc
2016-02-09 11:44:24	boobah	that runs a history-expansion for the last-run command starting with 'ls', so... might work? i don't wanna try it
2016-02-09 11:44:56	boobah	already killed my friend's irssi instance as well as my own. never again.

2016-02-09 11:46:58	boobah	S0lll0s: any advantage to using `command` instead of `env`
2016-02-09 11:46:59	boobah	?
2016-02-09 11:47:19	boobah	i know `command` is a builtin, that's why i usually avoid it
2016-02-09 11:47:41	boobah	although, it's a shell function so that part hardly matters
2016-02-09 11:48:06	OlaHughson	http://imgur.com/a/oqv5r
2016-02-09 11:48:07	S0lll0s	env also does environment-setting
2016-02-09 11:48:10	S0lll0s	if you want it to
2016-02-09 11:48:24	S0lll0s	"command" is just more basic and builtin i think
2016-02-09 11:48:46	boobah	good to know, forgot about that. and of course running it without any arguments is the same as `printenv`.
2016-02-09 11:48:51	S0lll0s	had to check if it was in bash even, i knew it was in fish
2016-02-09 11:48:56	S0lll0s	but apparently its POSIX
2016-02-09 11:49:11	boobah	it's in dash as well, so seems pretty safe

2016-02-09 13:45:44	chc4	some terminals have vim bindings
2016-02-09 13:45:49	chc4	or just use readline movements

2016-02-09 13:47:15	boobah	chc4: it's weird, i use all the emacs keys for the shell but i use vim keys for my editor. dunno why i like it that way

2016-02-09 13:48:33	boobah	what about it
2016-02-09 13:49:11	boobah	i'm saying i prefer the emacs mode in readline but i use vim... lol
2016-02-09 13:49:43	S0lll0s	well the command line has a very different typing/editing ratio than coding
2016-02-09 13:50:23	S0lll0s	programming is very little writing actually and in the terminal you spend the vast majority of the time just entering commands I'd say
2016-02-09 13:50:37	%adam	programming is just me drinking vodka

2016-02-09 13:51:53	boobah	it's just interesting because you can be pretty much just as fast with either keyset, but for some reason i like to split it up like that

2016-02-09 13:56:09	boobah	super interesting in principle, but there are too many symbolic maths for it to be fun for me
2016-02-09 13:56:17	fullsalvo	yeah, it's pretty abstract
2016-02-09 13:56:33	fullsalvo	plus it's pretty much just a statistics course
2016-02-09 13:56:42	boobah	too much of this for my taste: http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/quantum-mechanics-12908046.jpg

2016-02-09 13:59:29	boobah	i like learning about light and wave properties, but that's just too much non-numerical math
2016-02-09 14:00:05	%vypr	ur a wave property amirite
2016-02-09 14:00:45	fullsalvo	there's still a decent amount of numeric calculation in quantum in my opinion

2016-02-09 14:01:34	boobah	fullsalvo: maybe i just don't like math anymore. i dunno... math hasn't really been fun since Calculus BC in high school

2016-02-09 14:30:15	@rocx	it's just whoever's running this station's an idiot.

2016-02-09 14:33:51	dbcp	while we're on the topic, is there a command-line player that can play from Spotify and does scrobbling to Last.fm?
2016-02-09 14:34:22	dbcp	Because the default spotify player is about to piss me off tbh
2016-02-09 14:34:48	fullsalvo	ncmpcpp can do all of the above, I believe
2016-02-09 14:35:41	fullsalvo	dbcp: what bothers you about the default spotify player, though?
2016-02-09 14:36:41	%vypr	rocx: itunes
2016-02-09 14:37:12	@rocx	chc4: it's just what things call it when it's pushing an update of the playing song to your Last.FM thing.
2016-02-09 14:37:22	@rocx	dbcp: is it the ads?
2016-02-09 14:37:58	@rocx	'cause i noticed using a certain ho-

2016-02-09 14:38:03	@rocx	i don't have it.

2016-02-09 14:39:09	@rocx	http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/
2016-02-09 14:39:16	fullsalvo	mpd + mpdscribble is pretty nice for scrobbling
2016-02-09 14:39:30	@rocx	dbcp: using THIS hosts file (/etc/hosts), i noticed you can skip ads entirely in spotify desktop.
2016-02-09 14:39:32	fullsalvo	unless you're looking for the ability to "love" from the interface
2016-02-09 14:39:38	@rocx	but why do that when spotify is LACKING SONGS.
2016-02-09 14:39:55	boobah	everything lacks songs
2016-02-09 14:40:00	fullsalvo	^
2016-02-09 14:40:03	@rocx	boobah: THE SONGS I LIKE ARE THE ONES IT LACKS.
2016-02-09 14:40:06	fullsalvo	spotify is pretty nice, in my opinion
2016-02-09 14:40:06	@rocx	it never fails.
2016-02-09 14:40:12	fullsalvo	and it's $5 a month. That's nothing.
2016-02-09 14:40:24	@rocx	fullsalvo: well i'm a cheapskate.
2016-02-09 14:40:53	@rocx	but there *are* things on my last.fm that are not available on spoitfy.
2016-02-09 14:42:04	dbcp	Well, every time I update it there's a new issue.  Now, it seems like Ctrl-F no longer works and creating a new playlist causes weird issues.  
2016-02-09 14:42:15	@rocx	:\
2016-02-09 14:42:23	@rocx	to me, all spotify's good for is maybe branching out a bit.
2016-02-09 14:42:54	@rocx	and i swear if this station plays something ac/dc one more time i'mma kick someone in the groin.
2016-02-09 14:43:03	dbcp	I've had my music library as a spotify playlist for a good while now, and I'd hate to have to go back to downloading my music.  :/
2016-02-09 14:44:43	@rocx	acrap
2016-02-09 14:45:50	dbcp	Oh, and on the hosts file, I'm actually using https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
2016-02-09 14:46:24	@rocx	aw snap a consolidated hosts file.
2016-02-09 14:46:25	@rocx	genius.
2016-02-09 14:46:26	dbcp	I wasn't even aware the Spotify desktop app had ads... or at least I'd think it didn't have ads for premium users.  
2016-02-09 14:46:44	@rocx	dbcp: it had ads for free users. using the someonewhocares hosts solved that issue.
2016-02-09 14:48:23	dbcp	Ah, nice.  I guess the amalgamated list covers what someonewhocares covers
2016-02-09 14:49:22	@rocx	...we had a radio station called "The Bone"?
2016-02-09 14:50:42	dbcp	I have a cronjob that runs the script to update my hosts file based on that amalgamated list every day and I've almost forgotten that ads are a thing.  I also have it on my phone.  I recommended an app to my friend a while back and he ended up hating it because of the ads.  I was like "What ads?"  Apparently ads made it unusable.  
2016-02-09 14:53:00	@rocx	how'd you get it on your phone? rooting?
2016-02-09 14:53:10	@rocx	lucky.
2016-02-09 14:56:47	dbcp	Yep.  I just rooted my Nexus 6.  Before that, I had a rooted OnePlus One but it started doing funny shit like randomly rebooting, and it wouldn't work with my local carrier (CSpire), os I had shitty service with ATT on it.  
2016-02-09 14:57:04	@rocx	oh. so with $500+ phones. doesn't that ruin your warranty?
2016-02-09 14:57:56	dbcp	Well, I paid less for both phones lol.  And I got them both on eBay too, so... no real hope for warranty support.  
2016-02-09 14:58:26	@rocx	ah. probably going to see what i can do to root mine at some point.
2016-02-09 14:58:43	@rocx	i really *really* regret turning on the gps that one time.
2016-02-09 14:58:54	@rocx	now all the ads i get on spotify mobile are in spanish.
2016-02-09 15:00:30	@rocx	and firefox is seriously so slow it's pissing me off.
2016-02-09 15:00:40	dbcp	haha, that's hilarious.  Despite my nice hosts file, Amazon shows me shopping suggestions for things that I've reently googled.  Recently Amazon accosted me with suggestiongs that I buy a MLP pillow.  That's the last time I use google to find a video of something cringeworthy
2016-02-09 15:00:57	@rocx	> google
2016-02-09 15:01:00	@rocx	there's yer problem.
2016-02-09 15:01:42	dbcp	yeah, pretty much.  If DuckDuckSlow would actually work a little quicker, they'd have my business.  
2016-02-09 15:01:52	@rocx	never had an issue with speed.
2016-02-09 15:02:48	dbcp	That, and google is just good at search.
2016-02-09 15:03:07	dbcp	They take 2 more seconds than my patience is prepared to handle lol
2016-02-09 15:03:10	@rocx	pff. they suck at it and that's why i left it for bing back in 2009.
2016-02-09 15:03:25	@rocx	...which then started to suck then i switched to ddg in 2013.
2016-02-09 15:03:37	dbcp	I use bing at work because for some reason they have google link-follows blocked
2016-02-09 15:03:52	dbcp	And I get bing credits which is kind of nice
2016-02-09 15:07:05	@rocx	...wow. browser.xml "becoming unresponsive" is rage-inducing.

2016-02-15 23:39:58	sbrg	and I recently went through everything that I could possibly uninstall and removed a good deal

2016-02-16 01:23:45	%vypr	The language is pretty simple to learn and it'll only take a few months before you become decently fluent.

2016-02-16 04:13:31	TheLemonMan	I expected some cool combination of wmutils scripts

2016-02-16 04:13:41	+dcat	I am disappoint

2016-02-16 04:14:25	+dcat	arc: wat
2016-02-16 04:14:27	arc	and as much as you say you can script it, that's something that shouldn't be handled by a shell script
2016-02-16 04:14:34	arc	i mean i use wmutils
2016-02-16 04:15:04	arc	but something like dwm's tiling or a similar implementation would be better handled by a c program

2016-02-16 04:15:39	+dcat	that's why we made libwm
2016-02-16 04:16:38	arc	yeah it's something to look into
2016-02-16 04:16:40	+dcat	that's like holding a hammer and saying "this doesn't build a house"
2016-02-16 04:16:59	arc	but still
2016-02-16 04:17:07	arc	by the time you do fancy tiling with libwm and such
2016-02-16 04:17:12	arc	you're using a wm with libwm and wmutils as the backend
2016-02-16 04:17:46	+dcat	I don't understand what you're even saying
2016-02-16 04:17:57	+dcat	you do understand that wmutils is not a wm, right?
2016-02-16 04:18:01	arc	yes
2016-02-16 04:18:16	arc	but writing a tiling thing with libwm would be a wm
2016-02-16 04:18:22	arc	with wmutils as a backend to said wm
2016-02-16 04:18:39	+dcat	no
2016-02-16 04:18:46	+dcat	xcb would be the backend
2016-02-16 04:18:52	+dcat	wmutils would have nothing to do with it
2016-02-16 04:18:59	arc	now i'm confused
2016-02-16 04:19:15	stark	dcat, any ideas for launching application in specific groups via wmutils ?
2016-02-16 04:19:18	arc	you're saying 'that's why we made libwm' when i bring up 'wmutils doesn't do tiling'
2016-02-16 04:19:19	TheLemonMan	xcb isn't even a backend
2016-02-16 04:19:48	arc	so i assumed that implied libwm was created to add extra functionality to wmutils when that's probably not what it was designed for
2016-02-16 04:20:00	TheLemonMan	(from what I undestand) wmutils use libwm as backend
2016-02-16 04:20:06	arc	not anymore
2016-02-16 04:21:13	stark	also dcat totally forgot about this https://github.com/gstk/urxploitdvt
2016-02-16 04:21:32	stark	Scripting the opcodes
2016-02-16 04:21:34	+dcat	libwm is just wm routines in a library
2016-02-16 04:21:57	+dcat	completely unrelated to wmutils
2016-02-16 04:22:21	arc	it was related previously
2016-02-16 04:22:24	arc	as a dependency
2016-02-16 04:22:42	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:22:48	+dcat	but we removed it to make it more portable

2016-02-16 04:35:13	greduan	just ask yourself "what should this do?" and write a test that asserts that that happens
2016-02-16 04:35:16	greduan	and when it fails
2016-02-16 04:35:23	greduan	then you start writing your code to make that test pass
2016-02-16 04:35:27	greduan	once the test passes
2016-02-16 04:35:37	greduan	you refactor if needed and make sure the tests still pass
2016-02-16 04:35:49	greduan	and boom you know everything there is to know about unit testing. lol
2016-02-16 04:35:56	@rocx	yeah. found a neat project idea to "properly" code.
2016-02-16 04:36:11	@rocx	https://redd.it/45gsov
2016-02-16 04:36:37	@rocx	tl;dr someone failed to make a good enough vending machine.
2016-02-16 04:37:06	thlst	unit test is something rust supports out of the box
2016-02-16 04:37:09	thlst	i know you don't like rust
2016-02-16 04:37:12	thlst	but just saying
2016-02-16 04:37:40	@rocx	thlst: you sound just like chc4.
2016-02-16 04:37:48	@rocx	except i think he's also a hoon guy.
2016-02-16 04:38:04	thlst	i don't know chc4 unfortunately
2016-02-16 04:39:11	thlst	i just like rust because it's "good practice by default"
2016-02-16 04:40:24	greduan	I like languages like Go that just say "FUCK YOU THIS IS THE OFFICIAL CODING STYLE GUIDE AND IF YOU DERAIL FROM THIS YOU'RE A DICK"
2016-02-16 04:40:32	greduan	solves the biggest problem JS has
2016-02-16 04:40:46	greduan	which is that every goddamn Joe has his own lib for solving that one thing. lol
2016-02-16 04:40:55	+dcat	any of you guys good with html?
2016-02-16 04:41:11	+dcat	I'm trying to call a cgi script on click of a button
2016-02-16 04:41:19	+dcat	well, three different buttons
2016-02-16 04:41:35	@rocx	so you need to figure out how to make the script call when the button's clicked?
2016-02-16 04:41:43	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:41:57	+dcat	I know how to do it with a submit button and all of that shit
2016-02-16 04:42:22	+dcat	I just don't understand how to do it <input type=button ...
2016-02-16 04:42:32	greduan	you can do two things
2016-02-16 04:42:34	greduan	either
2016-02-16 04:42:43	greduan	onclick="yourfunc();"
2016-02-16 04:42:45	greduan	or
2016-02-16 04:42:46	@rocx	I think that action needs to be a web link to the script, the method needs to be GET.
2016-02-16 04:42:57	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:43:03	+dcat	but then you need a submit button
2016-02-16 04:43:04	greduan	what rocx said
2016-02-16 04:43:06	greduan	or
2016-02-16 04:43:09	greduan	the proper way
2016-02-16 04:43:10	greduan	which is
2016-02-16 04:43:16	@rocx	eg. "<form action="http://dead.cat/dcat-cgi/hello" method="GET"> ... </form>
2016-02-16 04:43:17	@venam	slowest connection ever atm
2016-02-16 04:43:24	@venam	I've never reached that low before
2016-02-16 04:43:33	@venam	and those are the time you can really appreciate irc
2016-02-16 04:43:40	@venam	it's still super fast
2016-02-16 04:43:47	+dcat	venam: my connection is too slow for irc
2016-02-16 04:43:48	@rocx	venam: pfff. i have a lot of times that i'll even lag out of irc.
2016-02-16 04:43:52	greduan	document.getElementById('yoursubmitbutton').on('click',function (e) { /* your AJAX thingy here */ })
2016-02-16 04:44:06	@rocx	whoa nelly man we don't need to get irrational here, greduan.
2016-02-16 04:44:11	+dcat	I usually type out a sentence before it appears
2016-02-16 04:44:18	greduan	rocx: that's the proper way to do it bro
2016-02-16 04:44:26	greduan	usually you use jQuery though
2016-02-16 04:44:27	@rocx	via jabbascript?
2016-02-16 04:44:30	+dcat	greduan: so I would have to use javascript?
2016-02-16 04:44:39	greduan	so $('yoursubmitbutton').on('click', ...)
2016-02-16 04:44:44	greduan	dcat: yes almost undoubtedly
2016-02-16 04:44:49	@rocx	i'm just going by this: http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/Perl/Cgi/forms.html
2016-02-16 04:44:55	greduan	if you want to do it properly at least and you don't have a form
2016-02-16 04:44:59	@venam	rocx: heresy, you don't know
2016-02-16 04:45:02	greduan	if you have a form then you do it the rocx way
2016-02-16 04:45:24	@venam	what can of form do you want?
2016-02-16 04:45:30	@venam	triangle, square, circles
2016-02-16 04:45:33	@venam	I can do them all

2016-02-16 07:56:02	greduan	I feel like if you want to use Atom but think it's too big and slow you should use Emacs. Which is even BIGGER but it's not slower.
2016-02-16 07:56:34	greduan	Emacs is a fucking kitchen sink. Wish somebody just made a minimal Emacs distribution which removed all the kruft and shit
2016-02-16 07:56:38	greduan	like butterfly-mode

2016-02-16 08:00:16	greduan	right
2016-02-16 08:00:18	@rocx	though don't quote me on this, but i remember something about how minimizing cruft is one of the "planned" things.
2016-02-16 08:00:27	@rocx	because there's ELPA.
2016-02-16 08:01:40	greduan	HA
2016-02-16 08:02:41	@rocx	yeah. "planned" ~~ "never gonna happen" if "planned" also includes my definition.
2016-02-16 08:05:39	greduan	all Emacs needs for me to properly consider switching to it is a proper operator and text-object interface
2016-02-16 08:05:47	greduan	and ofc some sensible navigation

2016-02-16 08:57:48	greduan	I think (map + '(1 2 3)) should work
2016-02-16 08:57:53	greduan	that's what my instinct tells me
2016-02-16 08:58:03	@rocx	nope.
2016-02-16 08:58:47	greduan	'+ ?
2016-02-16 08:58:56	greduan	since you're passing + as a value instead of as a func
2016-02-16 08:59:23	@rocx	well, this is CL and not Elisp, but it needs to know what to return.
2016-02-16 08:59:31	@rocx	so (map 'list '+ '(1 2 3))

2016-02-16 10:50:22	greduan	glhf
2016-02-16 10:50:30	@rocx	oh yeah i remember that.
2016-02-16 10:51:37	@rocx	so basically from what i remember what you said earlier today, one of your complaints is how Emacs handles text objects compared to vi. eh?
2016-02-16 10:52:04	@rocx	or what is considered a text object between motions.
2016-02-16 10:52:52	@rocx	what was the logic for 'C-w ip' deleting a paragraph?
2016-02-16 10:55:51	greduan	C-w is the operator
2016-02-16 10:55:54	greduan	delete
2016-02-16 10:56:29	greduan	ip is a text-object for "inside paragraph", i.e. the text of the paragraph. "ap" would be "around paragraph", i.e. the text and the new lines around it
2016-02-16 10:56:48	greduan	and that's it. lol
2016-02-16 10:57:00	arc	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2016-02-16 10:57:02	greduan	in Emacs you can't separate the operator from the text-object
2016-02-16 10:57:05	greduan	rc
2016-02-16 11:02:27	greduan	rocx: ^
2016-02-16 11:02:51	@rocx	rc?
2016-02-16 11:03:00	greduan	no no the things above
2016-02-16 11:03:12	@rocx	Oh.
2016-02-16 11:03:12	greduan	I was doing a joke with arc saying aaaaa and I said rc for aaaa+rc = arc
2016-02-16 11:03:41	@rocx	yeah. the best i can think of is C-w going into a "mode".
2016-02-16 11:03:57	greduan	right
2016-02-16 11:04:03	greduan	that's what it would do
2016-02-16 11:04:06	greduan	so code that up BOY
2016-02-16 11:04:22	@rocx	and then revert to a "normal" mode once the operation is done?
2016-02-16 11:04:27	greduan	ye

2016-02-17 07:13:22	sol	i made 100€, i wouldve had 800 or sth if i hadnt been to lazy to get verified on mtgox before they shut down
2016-02-17 07:13:50	sol	i paid .11BTC for a $6 pizza at the CCC in berlin because I didnt have any cash
2016-02-17 07:14:05	sol	and I knew that the guy who paid in advance was big on mining so we did that
2016-02-17 07:14:30	sol	so yeah 200€ pizza at worst
2016-02-17 07:14:42	sbrg	xero: yeah, srsly, re digitalization of currency.. If I have kids, which is still a few years away if it happens, they would probably never ever see paper money in my hands.. I literally never have cash. we can pay with our mobile phones in stores, so even if I don't have my card it's not even a biggie. 
2016-02-17 07:15:14	sbrg	in fact, the fact that I have to use actual coins to do my laundry in the basement is an annoyance because I never ever have cash. I make special trips to the atm so I can change to coins to do my laundry lol

2016-02-17 07:18:48	sbrg	if my apartment was broken into in the middle of the night and they wanted to take the dishwasher, I would offer up my own body and my girlfriend's life to keep it. i fucking hate doing dishes.

2016-02-17 07:55:43	@rocx	this digital tv movement was a stupid idea.
2016-02-17 07:56:03	@rocx	if your signal was fuzzy on analogue, barely anything was affected.
2016-02-17 07:56:37	@rocx	whereas with digital, no matter how you move the antennas, if your signal's remotely fuzzy, you can expect that weird corruption effect and audio entirely cuts out.
2016-02-17 07:59:10	@rocx	tv's practically pointless at that point.

2016-02-17 08:07:02	@rocx	no. you just have to use a specialized box to convert the signal.
2016-02-17 08:07:17	seth	I know but broadcast TV? Can't you just watch online?
2016-02-17 08:07:24	@rocx	it's an overall pain in the rumpus when you can't get your antennas right.

2016-02-17 15:05:39	@fro	regardless of brand
2016-02-17 15:05:41	ubr47k	unintentionally
2016-02-17 15:05:48	@fro	not sure what you guys are doing to these drives
2016-02-17 15:05:55	ubr47k	24/7 ?
2016-02-17 15:06:20	ubr47k	desktop load not some crazy whacko megafile transfers between disks

2016-02-17 15:07:34	ubr47k	am facing somewhat of a dilemma here
2016-02-17 15:08:40	ubr47k	RAID-1 or backups
2016-02-17 15:09:02	ubr47k	I understand backups are important but do people backup their multimedia n stuff
2016-02-17 15:09:09	ubr47k	movies, music, etc.
2016-02-17 15:09:30	@fro	yes
2016-02-17 15:09:38	@rocx	yeah.
2016-02-17 15:09:43	ubr47k	a 2+ TB backup file?
2016-02-17 15:09:53	@rocx	maybe ~2G.
2016-02-17 15:09:56	ubr47k	keeping snapshots of that size?
2016-02-17 15:10:06	@rocx	just individual files.
2016-02-17 15:10:09	sol	incremental backups?
2016-02-17 15:10:19	sol	i dont backup anything.... have yet to learn my lesson
2016-02-17 15:10:27	sol	though a few drives died on my already
2016-02-17 15:11:00	ubr47k	do bits in a HDD corrupt? much like bitflips in RAM?
2016-02-17 15:12:05	ubr47k	that could be a problem for LUKS+dmcrypt or just file integrity
2016-02-17 15:12:05		[15:12]
2016-02-17 15:12:15	ubr47k	though I suspect it does not happen
2016-02-17 15:12:29	sol	if you are as smart as I am you move your laptop too much and the r/w heads scratch the platters
2016-02-17 15:13:09	ubr47k	sol: my friend would smash the laptop more less around where the touchpad was
2016-02-17 15:13:24	ubr47k	his laptop drive died 3~ times I recall
2016-02-17 15:13:38	ubr47k	turns out the HDD was just below the touchpad
2016-02-17 15:13:52	sol	ubr47k: i strategically didnt suspend my laptop when carrying it around
2016-02-17 15:14:03	sol	turns out the HDD is INSIDE THE LAPTOP
2016-02-17 15:14:28	sol	which apparently gets a few shocks when you set down your laptop in the subway for example
2016-02-17 15:14:54	ubr47k	solid state ftw
2016-02-17 15:15:04	sol	same thing happened with my static iMac too though
2016-02-17 15:15:06	sol	>seagate
2016-02-17 15:15:43	ubr47k	I heard they're getting a lawsuit for the reliabilty problem
2016-02-17 15:19:05	ubr47k	welp, I learned my lesson, another brand
2016-02-17 15:20:05	sol	what happened to yours?
2016-02-17 15:20:30	sol	mine never really broke instantly 
2016-02-17 15:20:46	sol	i just needed to make like 40 boot attempts and then it would just work
2016-02-17 15:20:59	sol	and nothing would break until I turned it off again
2016-02-17 15:24:52	ubr47k	the first drive: windows would report bizarre filesizes for a few files (such as 2e-10323245), refusing to boot at some times
2016-02-17 15:25:27	ubr47k	booting to linux was 50/50 chance it would retrieve meaningful data
2016-02-17 15:25:58	ubr47k	the second drive: not detected in any computer, tried other cables, nada
2016-02-17 15:26:46	ubr47k	the latest one would either take very long times to retrieve a folder, access a file, "not responding" to file explorer, not recognizable by the OS
2016-02-17 15:26:56	ubr47k	etc etc
2016-02-17 15:27:24	ubr47k	they happen with no warning (well, I dont keep an eye on SMART)
2016-02-17 15:27:24		[15:27]
2016-02-17 15:29:58	ubr47k	the latest failure is not as frustrating as the other ones
2016-02-17 15:30:32	ubr47k	it was just a drive to store steam games so meh, nothing of value was lost
2016-02-17 15:31:02	ubr47k	except maybe it will take around 1 week to redownload at the current amazing 1.1MB/s internet DL speed

2016-02-18 09:52:17	@xero	but i agree w/ rocx

2016-02-18 09:59:20	@xero	maybe take a look at a project that spesifically does that
2016-02-18 09:59:23	@xero	like https://github.com/NickStrupat/Aligned
2016-02-18 10:00:20	@rocx	C++ is really confusing to read. it's verbose AND cryptic.
2016-02-18 10:00:29	@xero	fyr: see if whoever "nick strupat" is, was running his own gitserver i would have not found it in 0.5 seconds
2016-02-18 10:00:38	@xero	that's part of what i like about a big site like gh
2016-02-18 10:00:49	@xero	rocx: i agree.
2016-02-18 10:00:57	kirby	As in I don't think I get the theory because that readme isn't making a huge deal of sense (though I am quite tired tbh), thanks anyway though.
2016-02-18 10:00:58	@rocx	is that it's almost the status quo for software hosting now?
2016-02-18 10:01:11	kirby	And C++ isn't that bad, templates are a bit weird to read though.

2016-02-18 12:51:26	sol	it takes over port 80 and 443 by default
2016-02-18 12:51:27	%vypr	you don't have to, nor are required
2016-02-18 12:51:37	%vypr	that's because the average user doesn't use port 80 or 443

2016-02-18 18:31:11	@z3bra	plain-mode ?
2016-02-18 18:31:32	boobah	just the all-black stuff that i've seen in all your recent stuff
2016-02-18 18:32:02	boobah	'plain-mode' looks like an emacs mode :P
2016-02-18 18:32:02		[18:32]
2016-02-18 18:32:24	@z3bra	that's the default version of software
2016-02-18 18:32:52	@z3bra	the thing is
2016-02-18 18:32:54	boobah	still though..
2016-02-18 18:33:17	@z3bra	when you start "ricing" you never stop
2016-02-18 18:33:37	boobah	you stopped. others have stagnated as well, including myself.
2016-02-18 18:34:02	@z3bra	I could have kept my last setup, but at some I'd be like "ok, maybe I could just change this or that"
2016-02-18 18:34:09	@z3bra	and I'll start ricing again
2016-02-18 18:34:14	@z3bra	I don't want that
2016-02-18 18:34:16	boobah	oh
2016-02-18 18:34:22	boobah	work to do, right? :)
2016-02-18 18:34:34	@z3bra	well yeah kinda
2016-02-18 18:35:04	@z3bra	I decided that "sane default" is better than "fully customized" :)
2016-02-18 18:35:20	@z3bra	so from now on, I'll only customized what I need
2016-02-18 18:35:25	boobah	pretty hardcore, but i guess i see where you're coming from
2016-02-18 18:35:43	@z3bra	it's not that hardcode to be fair
2016-02-18 18:36:07	boobah	it is if you're using *all* defaults
2016-02-18 18:36:24	boobah	also tbh, sometimes it's just nice to have something pretty to look at.
2016-02-18 18:36:34	boobah	i'm sure you know that
2016-02-18 18:36:37	@z3bra	not it's not
2016-02-18 18:36:49	@z3bra	you'd be surprised how efficient softwares are by default
2016-02-18 18:37:21	@z3bra	and yeah, even if it's nice to look at, you get usedto terse looks
2016-02-18 18:37:58	boobah	ehhh... to a certain extent. for example, having to type out ':tabe' is objectively worse than hitting, say <C-t> that you mapped
2016-02-18 18:38:23	@z3bra	you don't need tabedit :)
2016-02-18 18:38:33	boobah	just an example bruh
2016-02-18 18:38:47	@z3bra	sure
2016-02-18 18:38:49	boobah	replace with whatever buffer manipulation commands
2016-02-18 18:39:24	boobah	i guess you still use wmutils, so that's cool
2016-02-18 18:39:28	@z3bra	sorry but I've been using the default vi keybinds for monthes without problem
2016-02-18 18:39:39	@z3bra	sure I do
2016-02-18 18:39:46	@z3bra	I wrote it for me in the first place :P
2016-02-18 18:39:53	boobah	yup, i remember :P
2016-02-18 18:40:30	boobah	it's not there's a *problem* with default keybinds, but the possibility for more efficient customizations is significant
2016-02-18 18:41:00	@z3bra	yeah
2016-02-18 18:41:00	boobah	i used traditional vi(1) for the entire year of 2014 pretty much
2016-02-18 18:41:14	boobah	but i work a lot faster now, even after i had gotten used to the plain stuff
2016-02-18 18:41:19	@z3bra	but if you go down this route, you'll start adding more and more keybinds
2016-02-18 18:41:34	boobah	sometimes visual-block is 10x faster than typing out a regex
2016-02-18 18:41:34	@z3bra	and end up spending more time customizing your vimrc than actually using it
2016-02-18 18:41:44	@z3bra	that's why I stopped using vim
2016-02-18 18:42:02	boobah	all that's needed is a bit of self control. here, lemme run a stat(1) on my vimrc to see the last time i touched it
2016-02-18 18:42:41	boobah	2 months? and i switched back to vim 3 months ago. so that's really not bad at all.
2016-02-18 18:43:51	@z3bra	if you can control yourself, that's cool
2016-02-18 18:43:56	@z3bra	I can't myself
2016-02-18 18:43:58	boobah	:)
2016-02-18 18:44:03	boobah	if you say so
2016-02-18 18:44:04	@z3bra	so default it is!
2016-02-18 18:44:29	boobah	what editor are you using now? last time we talked you were saying how it was hard to keep up with vis commits
2016-02-18 18:44:37	@z3bra	and I'm pretty happy
2016-02-18 18:44:42	@z3bra	I'm using it though
2016-02-18 18:44:59	boobah	lol, as long as you're happy, man!
2016-02-18 18:45:06	@z3bra	the hard thing was that every commit was breaking the config.h compatibility
2016-02-18 18:45:20	boobah	that's actually a lot more important than being 100% efficient or whatever
2016-02-18 18:45:21	@z3bra	so I decided to use the default one
2016-02-18 18:45:36	@z3bra	and now I'm 100% efficient :P
2016-02-18 18:45:45	boobah	nice :D
2016-02-18 18:46:58	boobah	still using crux, maintaining ports?
2016-02-18 18:47:02	@z3bra	yup
2016-02-18 18:47:02		[18:47]
2016-02-18 18:47:08	@z3bra	not maintaining ports much though
2016-02-18 18:47:15	boobah	that sounds like such a time sink, dunno how you guys do it
2016-02-18 18:47:18	@z3bra	too busy with the distro
2016-02-18 18:47:34	@z3bra	well, updating git-based ports is as easy as
2016-02-18 18:47:42	@z3bra	upthemall
2016-02-18 18:47:44	@z3bra	:P
2016-02-18 18:47:57	@z3bra	then git add/commit/push
2016-02-18 18:48:10	@z3bra	for the others, ell, I update them as neded
2016-02-18 18:48:13	@z3bra	needed
2016-02-18 18:48:18	boobah	can't wait to see how that all goes. i want to experiment with some of that stuff myself, but i don't have the time currently
2016-02-18 18:48:39	@z3bra	I finally got gcc static packed and working :)
2016-02-18 18:48:50	@z3bra	so I'll soon be able to bootstrap my distro
2016-02-18 18:48:55	@z3bra	that'll be neat
2016-02-18 18:48:58	@z3bra	(I hope)
2016-02-18 18:49:01	boobah	whoa, mind running a `du -k` on it for me?
2016-02-18 18:49:13	boobah	curious how big a static gcc is
2016-02-18 18:49:36	@z3bra	3.4M    /ns/pm/rootfs/bin/gcc
2016-02-18 18:49:55	boobah	not bad! of course, you'd need the libs to compile useful stuff, but that's awesome!
2016-02-18 18:50:11	@z3bra	it only supports C though
2016-02-18 18:50:23	boobah	who needs c++ :P
2016-02-18 18:50:26	@z3bra	389M    /ns/pm/rootfs/
2016-02-18 18:50:29	boobah	`/ns` == "network share"?
2016-02-18 18:50:32	@z3bra	that's the whole distro
2016-02-18 18:50:36	@z3bra	namespace
2016-02-18 18:50:41	boobah	oh
2016-02-18 18:50:49	boobah	ie. the chroot
2016-02-18 18:51:16	@z3bra	yeah
2016-02-18 18:51:20	@z3bra	going to work
2016-02-18 18:51:23	@z3bra	maybe later :)
2016-02-18 18:51:25	@z3bra	cheers
2016-02-18 18:51:30	boobah	seeya :)

2016-02-19 03:32:37	asdf	when you say pure, it's really pure, like, everything is a function

2016-02-19 03:35:12	@xero	JavaScript, Lua[46] and Python had first class functions from their inception
2016-02-19 03:35:13	@rocx	i mean would it be a valuable skill to have since there's no sign of the JVM going away.

2016-02-19 03:35:36	@xero	but you have to write your code with 1st class functions
2016-02-19 03:35:37	%adam	i did
2016-02-19 03:35:42	@xero	it's how the language is designed
2016-02-19 03:35:49	@xero	so by definition, it's a functional language

2016-02-19 03:37:16	@xero	correct
2016-02-19 03:37:30	@xero	purescript is a port of js that makes it more so
2016-02-19 03:37:34	jona	nobody gives a shit if its pure or not. i love the process-oriented paradigm in erlang
2016-02-19 03:37:48	jona	multi-paradigm languages are the best

2016-02-19 04:59:24	@rocx	basically it's just a different origin point. whereas graphics normally have origin at the top-left, cartesian coordinates tend to be bottom-left or center.

2016-02-19 05:00:09	@z3bra	that would require complex tools

2016-02-19 05:19:50	@z3bra	thlst, so you don't have "exec 2bwm" at the bottom
2016-02-19 05:20:15	thlst	dcat: hsetroot
2016-02-19 05:20:21	thlst	it's a generated script
2016-02-19 05:22:19	thlst	funny, it worked
2016-02-19 05:22:23	thlst	(exec 2bwm)
2016-02-19 05:22:27	thlst	that's fucking weird
2016-02-19 05:23:35	dcat	how odd
2016-02-19 05:24:18	@z3bra	lol, that's not fuccny
2016-02-19 05:24:20	@z3bra	funny
2016-02-19 05:24:28	@z3bra	that's how it is supposed to behave :)
2016-02-19 05:24:36	@z3bra	maybe you wrote something like
2016-02-19 05:24:39	@z3bra	exec 2bwm &
2016-02-19 05:24:54	thlst	i don't remember
2016-02-19 05:25:18	dcat	brotip for all of you that have missed this in xinitrc
2016-02-19 05:25:18		[05:25]
2016-02-19 05:25:39	dcat	you wanna start your wm /before/ running some of the programs in xinitrc
2016-02-19 05:25:47	dcat	my_wm &
2016-02-19 05:25:50	dcat	[...]
2016-02-19 05:25:52	dcat	wait %1
2016-02-19 05:26:16	@xero	i always start my daemons like mpd before the wm
2016-02-19 05:26:20	@xero	any reason why not to?
2016-02-19 05:26:30	dcat	no
2016-02-19 05:26:44	dcat	mpd has nothing to do with X, so you're safe
2016-02-19 05:28:20	dcat	there's so many overlooked shell functions
2016-02-19 05:28:34	dcat	I mostly use a single term for programming
2016-02-19 05:28:41	dcat	vi pgm.c

2016-02-19 05:29:56	@rocx	f?
2016-02-19 05:29:59	dcat	oh yeah
2016-02-19 05:30:03	dcat	I alias f=fg
2016-02-19 05:30:09	dcat	cause I'm lazy as fuuuuuu
2016-02-19 05:30:14	@rocx	ah.
2016-02-19 05:30:22	@xero	i use a lot of watchers for my code, (and most web stuff is not compiled) so when i :w it just sends the update ping to my app runners and everything reloads w/o closing vim
2016-02-19 05:30:55	@rocx	kind of not too fond of jekyll right now.
2016-02-19 05:31:07	dcat	I used to use vim-dispatch
2016-02-19 05:31:15	dcat	but my fucking god is that a shitty solution
2016-02-19 05:31:24	@xero	grunt watch
2016-02-19 05:31:25	@rocx	it just feels like a lot of tracing through templates and heck, the jekyll site doesn't quite have a link to the Liquid templating.
2016-02-19 05:31:45	@rocx	dcat: you use vis or nvi now, right?
2016-02-19 05:32:00	dcat	nvi
2016-02-19 05:32:06	@rocx	ah. still. just curious.
2016-02-19 05:32:16	@xero	he uses the gui neovim
2016-02-19 05:32:17	dcat	or vim when I'm lazy and want colors
2016-02-19 05:32:19	@xero	dont let him lie to you

2016-02-19 05:33:18	dcat	right now I'm using vim
2016-02-19 05:33:26	dcat	cause without syntax highlighting I'd be lost as fuck
2016-02-19 05:33:38	@xero	<3333
2016-02-19 05:33:48	dcat	also
2016-02-19 05:33:55	@z3bra	honestly, it's not *that* bad without syntax hl
2016-02-19 05:33:57	dcat	that suckless or cat-v thing about syntax highlighting
2016-02-19 05:34:03	@rocx	aiju.
2016-02-19 05:34:12	dcat	oh yeah
2016-02-19 05:34:20	@rocx	it's a constraint thing as well as the 80char rule in code though.
2016-02-19 05:34:31	@z3bra	indeed
2016-02-19 05:34:33	@rocx	if your code's too hard too read without colors, it's probably too jumbled.
2016-02-19 05:34:43	@z3bra	that's a good point
2016-02-19 05:35:05	@rocx	i just use a few tints of white. darkened comments help.
2016-02-19 05:35:11	dcat	nah
2016-02-19 05:35:14	dcat	its just cocoa
2016-02-19 05:35:26	%adam	i use ms word
2016-02-19 05:35:29	@xero	u can read json (for instance) but it's WAY easier w/ highlighting
2016-02-19 05:35:38	@rocx	YAML > JSON.
2016-02-19 05:35:41	@rocx	jus' sayin'.
2016-02-19 05:35:50	@xero	rocx: i dont get to pick at work
2016-02-19 05:35:51	dcat	isn't json stricter?
2016-02-19 05:36:12	@xero	sometimes you have to do what "the boss" says if you want to get paid
2016-02-19 05:36:31	%adam	The Man.
2016-02-19 05:36:32	@xero	json is super strict. but with linters it's easy]

2016-02-19 05:43:46	dcat	how is it different from `at`?
2016-02-19 05:45:40	@xero	nq != at
2016-02-19 05:45:59	dcat	I can't be bothered to read the README
2016-02-19 05:46:04	dcat	can you give me a tl;dr?
2016-02-19 05:48:03	@z3bra	you "enqueue" commands
2016-02-19 05:48:08	@z3bra	as in, stack them
2016-02-19 05:48:15	@z3bra	and then pop them out
2016-02-19 05:48:31	dcat	so job ctl?
2016-02-19 05:48:45	@z3bra	more like
2016-02-19 05:48:54	@z3bra	cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3
2016-02-19 05:49:00	@z3bra	could be rewritten as

2016-02-19 05:49:03	@z3bra	nq cmd2

2016-02-19 05:49:07	@z3bra	fq
2016-02-19 05:49:17	@z3bra	it seems
2016-02-19 05:49:22	dcat	ah
2016-02-19 05:49:25	@rocx	nacquound and forequound
2016-02-19 05:49:41	@z3bra	nq == enqueue (when pronounced)
2016-02-19 05:49:43	dcat	guys
2016-02-19 05:49:46	dcat	I just had a memory
2016-02-19 05:49:53	thlst	http://i.imgur.com/Iuq50k2.png
2016-02-19 05:49:54	dcat	I remember when I was in high school
2016-02-19 05:50:04	dcat	I was so afraid whenever I put on my headset
2016-02-19 05:50:24	dcat	that I would make a whistle sound when I was breathing
2016-02-19 05:50:25	%adam	thlst: looks good
2016-02-19 05:50:39	dcat	so I took off one ear of my headset at all times
2016-02-19 05:51:00	thlst	adam: ty
2016-02-19 05:51:02	@xero	thlst++
2016-02-19 05:51:03	dcat	so I could notice if I was whistling
2016-02-19 05:51:13	@xero	dcat: where you ever?
2016-02-19 05:51:20	dcat	I don't know
2016-02-19 05:51:22	dcat	I think so
2016-02-19 05:51:47	dcat	I just remembered cause it's making that sound now
2016-02-19 05:51:56	dcat	which is really weird
2016-02-19 05:51:56	@rocx	these headphones are sound-unproofed that you could hear the floor creaking down the stairs.
2016-02-19 05:51:57	@xero	thlst: some of those colors are pretty kark though. you're wall is way lighter and it kinda offset my eyes a bit
2016-02-19 05:52:08	dcat	cause I was never worried about being embarrased
2016-02-19 05:52:26	dcat	I would pull my dick out in front of the teacher and do the helicopter
2016-02-19 05:52:29	dcat	no shame
2016-02-19 05:52:38	kirby	Whoah there
2016-02-19 05:52:39	@xero	dcat: was it more fear of something wrong them maybe?
2016-02-19 05:52:42	dcat	but god forbid I ever made a whistling sound with my nose
2016-02-19 05:52:50	thlst	xero: when it's day (sun light) i keep wallpapers lighty
2016-02-19 05:52:58	dcat	no idea
2016-02-19 05:53:16	@rocx	yeah i definitely need a wallpaper with time-of-day themes.
2016-02-19 05:53:29	@rocx	or just a cron job to change them based on the day.
2016-02-19 05:53:39	@rocx	a timepaper.
2016-02-19 05:53:42	%adam	theres a nice 8-bit landscape pack
2016-02-19 05:53:43	@xero	i wrote a script a while ago that basically did that
2016-02-19 05:53:45	%adam	somewhere
2016-02-19 05:53:48	@xero	but with solid colors
2016-02-19 05:54:02	@xero	hourly cron that darkended it
2016-02-19 05:54:12	@xero	hrm... i wonder if i still have it
2016-02-19 05:54:18	@rocx	adam: 8-bit == full color but every square's 3-4px large and resolution might change.
2016-02-19 05:55:45	thlst	when night, i set a dark tiling wallpaper
2016-02-19 05:56:02	dcat	anyone familiar with gdb/lldb?
2016-02-19 05:57:41	paul	what's the problem officer?
2016-02-19 05:59:31	greduan	paul: you say "what seems to be the problem, officer?"
2016-02-19 05:59:31		[05:59]
2016-02-19 05:59:45	greduan	that way you separate yourself even more from the scene
2016-02-19 06:00:01	%adam	what seems to be the officer, problem?
2016-02-19 06:00:09	@rocx	 we have a problem officer?
2016-02-19 06:00:20	@rocx	i vote someone for our official officer of problems.
2016-02-19 06:00:38	thlst	xero: what is 'kark'?
2016-02-19 06:00:45	@rocx	also, screw it, i'm giving Racket a look.

2016-02-19 06:12:15	dcat	I guess I only need to invert the Y axis

2016-02-19 06:13:19	dcat	but aqua doesn't report anything

2016-02-19 06:23:08	@z3bra	dcat, yep, X axis only
2016-02-19 06:23:35	@z3bra	depending on how windows coordinates are set, perhaps substract the height too

2016-02-20 01:26:34	arc	yes

2016-02-20 01:26:44	arc	xquartz
2016-02-20 01:26:44	dcat	yes
2016-02-20 01:26:54	dcat	you don't need xquartz

2016-02-20 01:27:46	storm	I don't really care about the looks
2016-02-20 01:27:57	storm	all that much functionaliy matters more tbqh
2016-02-20 01:28:16	dcat	then osx is for you
2016-02-20 01:28:55	arc	question of the day
2016-02-20 01:29:02	arc	should i install openbsd
2016-02-20 01:29:13	kirby	Everyone is going to say yes.
2016-02-20 01:29:15	dcat	on what?
2016-02-20 01:29:16	storm	dcat: but I heard brew is missing a lot of libraries and packages
2016-02-20 01:29:21	arc	my laptop
2016-02-20 01:29:25	kirby	I'm going to say check hardware compatability at least first.
2016-02-20 01:29:33	dcat	what hardware does your laptop have?
2016-02-20 01:29:33	arc	it's compatible

2016-02-20 01:30:51	storm	dcat: What can I use that would be similar to wmutils? on osx
2016-02-20 01:31:04	arc	probably something like hammerspoon maybe
2016-02-20 01:31:15	dcat	storm: osx comes with applescript
2016-02-20 01:31:30	dcat	which lets you control GUI through commandline
2016-02-20 01:32:04	storm	ooohhh sounds nice
2016-02-20 01:32:08	dcat	arc: I would install openbsd or netbsd
2016-02-20 01:32:20	storm	arc: why did you post your mac address ;_;

2016-02-20 02:20:11	%adam	heres the verbose scale
2016-02-20 02:20:11	chc4	point me at some ugly code in gallium

2016-02-20 02:21:18	%adam	that took me longer to notice than id like to admit
2016-02-20 02:21:19	chc4	it is
2016-02-20 02:21:21	chc4	this is true
2016-02-20 02:22:14	chc4	rust is nice though. it's like C that holds you hand so you can't fuck up and write exploitable code and make computers terrible
2016-02-20 02:22:25	thlst	i'm using more c++ (because specialization) though, but rust really made me a better programmer
2016-02-20 02:22:31	%vypr	the only thing rust has going is memory-safety

2016-02-20 02:22:49	%adam	look man
2016-02-20 02:22:52	%adam	when were talkin about rust
2016-02-20 02:22:52	%vypr	thlst: does rust have fp?
2016-02-20 02:22:54	%adam	nothing is serious
2016-02-20 02:23:01	%vypr	thlst: *shrug*

2016-02-20 02:26:16	seth	xero that's great
2016-02-20 02:26:34	thlst	also, the way rust separates data from functions, that is really good
2016-02-20 02:26:56	thlst	i mean, there is no oop like classes, inheritance etc
2016-02-20 02:27:02	@xero	i agree that it has a lot of great features to help devs not fall into classic pitfalls
2016-02-20 02:27:17	@xero	but it's obsurd to say any technology protects you 100% and is future proof
2016-02-20 02:27:27	%vypr	i would use C an assload more if it had oop normally implemented
2016-02-20 02:27:33	%vypr	i don't mean going as far as C++ would with oop
2016-02-20 02:27:35	thlst	what? no, rust doesn't protect you from shooting your foot
2016-02-20 02:27:41	%vypr	but just classes with polymorphism
2016-02-20 02:27:42	%vypr	and i'd be fine
2016-02-20 02:27:49	@z3bra	C doesn't have oop implemented at all

2016-02-20 02:42:42	fyr	does it have a url grabber patch?
2016-02-20 02:42:43	arc	it's a nice terminal
2016-02-20 02:42:44	@z3bra	so the xurls script should extract URLs from this "term dump"

2016-02-20 10:38:15	%vypr	also very few distros have secure boot support

2016-02-20 10:45:46	greduan	cya
2016-02-20 10:46:03	greduan	man all he really needs to know is how to sit still doing nothing for 3 hours straight and he goes off and reads shit
2016-02-20 10:46:15	greduan	just *BE* there comfortably
2016-02-20 10:46:20	greduan	that's ALL meditation is
2016-02-20 10:46:23	greduan	or should be IMO
2016-02-20 10:46:33	t0b1nux	Don't get me wrong, they are excellent IRC clients out there, but I would like to see SSL by default for such a mature protocol
2016-02-20 10:46:43	greduan	I can meditate for 3 hours straight, no problem, I can take you any day, fite me
2016-02-20 10:46:55	%vypr	greduan: i don't think you get it mate
2016-02-20 10:47:27	%vypr	its not as black and white as it seems
2016-02-20 10:47:28	greduan	I get it more than you :P

2016-02-20 10:47:34	greduan	no but seriously
2016-02-20 10:47:35	greduan	sorry
2016-02-20 10:47:38	greduan	but seriously
2016-02-20 10:47:41	greduan	what do you do when you meditate?
2016-02-20 10:47:47	%vypr	focus on breath
2016-02-20 10:47:49	%vypr	anapanasati
2016-02-20 10:48:01	%vypr	(trans. 'mindfulness of breath')
2016-02-20 10:48:16	%vypr	as well as vipassana
2016-02-20 10:48:20	%vypr	which is insight meditation
2016-02-20 10:48:30	greduan	ic
2016-02-20 10:48:41	%vypr	the final one i do is metta meditation
2016-02-20 10:48:59	%vypr	which involves cultivating compassion and all that jazz
2016-02-20 10:49:06	greduan	see the meditation I do is way simpler. it's literally just sit there comfortably. you don't need to think about anything or be mindful of anything, just sit there.
2016-02-20 10:49:19	%vypr	...right.
2016-02-20 10:49:24	%vypr	i don't think that's meditation
2016-02-20 10:49:31	%vypr	that sounds like sitting
2016-02-20 10:49:37	greduan	sitting yeah, it's great
2016-02-20 10:49:43	%vypr	go home
2016-02-20 10:50:41	%adam	question
2016-02-20 10:50:44	%vypr	adam: sup
2016-02-20 10:50:52	ygstr	What's a good tech movie
2016-02-20 10:50:58	%adam	should i buy adamdrinkstoomuch.vodka or adamdrinkstoomuch.beer
2016-02-20 10:50:58		[10:50]
2016-02-20 10:51:06	%vypr	adam: beer
2016-02-20 10:51:15	%adam	see i was thinkin beer too cause its easier to drin
2016-02-20 10:51:23	%adam	but in reality i do drink a lot of vodka
2016-02-20 10:51:49	%adam	i may go with beer since its like
2016-02-20 10:51:56	%adam	the coca cola of alcoholic beverages
2016-02-20 10:52:35	%vypr	greduan: btw buddhism is much more than meditation
2016-02-20 10:52:39	tm512	vodka is the water of alcoholic beverages. boring.
2016-02-20 10:52:52	%adam	bro vodka gets me way more outta it
2016-02-20 10:54:21	tm512	still a boring thing to drink. beer has flavor and complexity
2016-02-20 10:54:27	tm512	well, good beer anyway
2016-02-20 10:55:02	greduan	vypr: I imagine.
2016-02-20 10:55:16	greduan	BTW vypr you're not the only weird one. I'm a Scientologist. :P
2016-02-20 10:55:28	%adam	whats up, tom cruise
2016-02-20 10:55:49	greduan	nah nah nah
2016-02-20 10:55:59	greduan	Tom Cruise is in the Church of Scientology.
2016-02-20 10:56:12	greduan	Scientology is just a label they put on themselves, they don't teach or apply Scientology
2016-02-20 10:56:33	%adam	my close minded american mind is incapable of understanding
2016-02-20 10:56:46	%adam	wait while i consume more cheeseburgers to contemplat
2016-02-20 10:56:49	%adam	okay
2016-02-20 10:56:51	%adam	i swear
2016-02-20 10:56:56	%adam	i my keyboard is not broken
2016-02-20 10:57:03	%adam	i just forget to hit the last letter in a sentence
2016-02-20 10:57:16	greduan	last time I visited a Church of Scientology was in... 207
2016-02-20 10:57:18	greduan	2007*
2016-02-20 10:57:52	greduan	wasn't hard to get out since I wasn't paying them millions for them to fuck me over as a being
2016-02-20 10:58:01	greduan	lol
2016-02-20 10:58:31	greduan	Afterwards I've just been out in the Ron's Org, which is part of the freezone, i.e. Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology.
2016-02-20 10:58:37	greduan	and that concludes my religious background
2016-02-20 10:58:47	%adam	thats cool
2016-02-20 10:58:50	%adam	mines kinda like
2016-02-20 10:59:07	%adam	i was raised catholic and firmly believed in my faith until i started drinking
2016-02-20 10:59:15	tm512	lol
2016-02-20 10:59:45	tm512	I was raised in a way that allowed me to come to my own conclusions about reality
2016-02-20 10:59:53	greduan	^^
2016-02-20 11:00:09	tm512	so I guess I feel lucky in that respect, since it seems like you guys didn't get that
2016-02-20 11:00:29	greduan	I did, they just told me some stuff and as I grew up I checked it out for myself
2016-02-20 11:00:43	%adam	i never did but
2016-02-20 11:01:01	%adam	i never cared much to figure it out myself until i got outta my hometown
2016-02-20 11:01:12	greduan	One thing that in the Church they don't properly apply, but is taken very seriously in the Ron's Org, is that "if it's real for you, it's real for you, if it's not real for you, it's not real for you"
2016-02-20 11:01:19	arc	hello i have a cellphone in my mouth
2016-02-20 11:01:26	greduan	arc: how are you typing?
2016-02-20 11:01:29	greduan	theory debunked
2016-02-20 11:01:32	arc	my computer
2016-02-20 11:01:37	greduan	fuck
2016-02-20 11:02:00	tm512	just from an early age I realized how much religion and spirituality conflicted with science, logic, and reality
2016-02-20 11:02:12	greduan	anyway that's the whole thing about Scientology, if something is real for you it's real for you, if it isn't it isn't, and that's that. they won't try to convince you or anything.
2016-02-20 11:02:41	greduan	tm512: Spirituality doesn't conflict with science, logic and reality IMO. Since for me spirituality IS reality.
2016-02-20 11:02:47	greduan	like
2016-02-20 11:02:53	greduan	yeah you've a body, who doesn't
2016-02-20 11:03:00	tm512	and I think you're delusional believing that
2016-02-20 11:03:05	tm512	no offense, just honesty
2016-02-20 11:03:36	greduan	for me it just seems like evolution, as it is presented, is a fucking way too intelligent machine for it to not have some sort of intelligent force behind it.
2016-02-20 11:03:42	greduan	intelligence only exists in life.
2016-02-20 11:03:51	greduan	like
2016-02-20 11:03:53	greduan	OK the heard
2016-02-20 11:03:55	greduan	heart*
2016-02-20 11:03:59	greduan	have you seen how that shit works?
2016-02-20 11:04:16	greduan	that is WAAAAAAY too complex for something with virtually no intelligence, like evolution, to EVER figure out
2016-02-20 11:04:25	ygstr	greduan: looking for a good laptop now
2016-02-20 11:04:27	tm512	evolution has been working on life for billions of years
2016-02-20 11:04:41	tm512	this complexity arose gradually
2016-02-20 11:04:43	greduan	ygstr: cool
2016-02-20 11:05:00	tm512	over a scale of time that our brains are really really bad at comprehending
2016-02-20 11:05:05	greduan	tm512: it's still WAAY to random and dumb for me to believe that there wasn't an intelligent force behind it.
2016-02-20 11:05:12	tm512	it's not random
2016-02-20 11:05:21	tm512	it's chemistry
2016-02-20 11:05:28	greduan	evolution is random
2016-02-20 11:05:29	tm512	and biology
2016-02-20 11:05:34	tm512	no, it's not random
2016-02-20 11:05:38	%adam	it does actually make a lot of sense, scientifically
2016-02-20 11:05:42	%adam	how we came about
2016-02-20 11:05:46	greduan	evolution is literally "whoever didn't die, gets to reproduce and adapt further"
2016-02-20 11:05:59	tm512	that is the opposite of random greduan 
2016-02-20 11:05:59		[11:05]
2016-02-20 11:06:18	greduan	tm512: I'm talking about way before that, I'm talking about before a thing like a "heart" ever came about
2016-02-20 11:06:20	tm512	the only traits that get passed on are positive or neutral in terms of impact on reproduction
2016-02-20 11:06:23	greduan	a heart is a fucking complex machine.
2016-02-20 11:06:29	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:06:35	tm512	and a billion years is a really fucking long time
2016-02-20 11:06:49	greduan	you know what's longer? trillions. :P
2016-02-20 11:07:04	tm512	your point?
2016-02-20 11:07:11	greduan	none, hence the :P
2016-02-20 11:07:17	tm512	so why bother saying it
2016-02-20 11:07:24	greduan	cause it came to my mind. lol
2016-02-20 11:07:37	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:07:48	greduan	I'm not saying science is wrong
2016-02-20 11:07:53	tm512	you are
2016-02-20 11:07:55	greduan	I find fascinating the stuff people find
2016-02-20 11:08:15	greduan	people = scientists
2016-02-20 11:08:31	tm512	rejecting evolution means you only accept science when it doesn't conflict with your preexisting belief system
2016-02-20 11:08:47	greduan	I just think they are somewhat blinded by the fact they've completely taken spirituality out of the whole equation of this universe. Even though shit tons of stuff would make sense if you include it.
2016-02-20 11:08:55	tm512	so have fun with your cognitive dissonance
2016-02-20 11:09:36	tm512	there is no evidence that spirits exist, so science has no business considering it
2016-02-20 11:10:20	greduan	BTW I'm not OK with evolution as it is presented. I did not say we did not evolve. I just believe, and this is my own belief, that evolution was engineered. I.e. somebody decided "all right this planet looks good, hey guys start working on those humanoid things, but first put some bacteria in there, get some oxygen in there"
2016-02-20 11:10:44	greduan	I.e. aliens.
2016-02-20 11:10:48	tm512	and where did that "somebody" come from?
2016-02-20 11:10:53	greduan	But hey aliens haven't been proven either right?
2016-02-20 11:10:55	tm512	you're just pushing the problem back further
2016-02-20 11:11:31	greduan	This universe is way way way way way way way way way fucking WAAAAAY too fucking WAAAY older than scientists believe it to be. lol
2016-02-20 11:11:41	tm512	where is your evidence?
2016-02-20 11:11:43	greduan	if you look at it that way, very likely that we were put here.
2016-02-20 11:11:57	greduan	my recollections on the matter?
2016-02-20 11:12:04	tm512	that's not evidence
2016-02-20 11:12:08	greduan	it is for me son
2016-02-20 11:12:12	%adam	HEYO
2016-02-20 11:12:30	greduan	if you suddenly recall that you were a viking at some point, it sure as hell is real for you that you were a viking, no?
2016-02-20 11:12:31	tm512	you don't get to define what evidence is for everyone else
2016-02-20 11:12:31	%adam	BADA BING WIT A PIPE
2016-02-20 11:12:58	greduan	adam: don't worry this argument is fun for me. Cause I ain't trying to change his opinion and I ain't changing mine. I'm just stating my opinion.
2016-02-20 11:13:03	tm512	greduan: no, I'd probably go to get my head checked
2016-02-20 11:13:15	greduan	tm512: and get drugged and shit and die? sad life bro. lol
2016-02-20 11:13:16	%adam	greduan: vodka
2016-02-20 11:13:50	greduan	but hey you'll get another shot at it whenever you feel like it so death ain't that bad, but it sure is bad when it happens. lol
2016-02-20 11:14:16	tm512	well, my death is inevitable
2016-02-20 11:14:24	greduan	as is my body's
2016-02-20 11:14:28	tm512	and if I was having delusions that were bothering me, I'd probably accept the drugs
2016-02-20 11:14:53	greduan	oh I've no delusions bothering me atm
2016-02-20 11:15:02	greduan	or ever really
2016-02-20 11:15:17	greduan	if the "delusion" happened, it happened I accept it and move on. lol
2016-02-20 11:15:26	tm512	right, you're accepting of your delusions
2016-02-20 11:15:49	greduan	what other thing is there to do?
2016-02-20 11:15:51	greduan	reject them?
2016-02-20 11:16:06	tm512	if you care about logic and reason, yes
2016-02-20 11:16:46	greduan	a delusion is just that, a delusion. they happen. it's like when you think your SO is cheating on you, that's a delusion until proven (hard hard proof), yet we accept that as logic. lol
2016-02-20 11:17:40	tm512	a delusion is not just a suspicion
2016-02-20 11:17:59	greduan	many times people go ape shit over a suspicion. lol

2016-02-20 11:19:11	tm512	too bad for you
2016-02-20 11:19:29	tm512	the only thing I'm confused about is how you've arrived at what you believe in
2016-02-20 11:19:51	greduan	what part of it? most of it was through coming to my own conclussions after being given data.
2016-02-20 11:20:20	greduan	like for example
2016-02-20 11:20:44	greduan	the thing that I am a spiritual being, what in Scn we call a "thetan", that was taught to me as a child and I accepted it, seemed only logical to me at the time.
2016-02-20 11:20:46	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:31	greduan	I learnt other stuff, like past lives and how you're not your body, you're just stuck to it, those things. I accepted those on the basis that I am a thetan so that only makes sense.
2016-02-20 11:21:31		[11:21]
2016-02-20 11:21:33	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:38	ygstr	o lord
2016-02-20 11:21:44	ygstr	what have I missed
2016-02-20 11:21:46	greduan	let me finish lol
2016-02-20 11:21:55	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:58	tm512	except the soul is just a construct of our own minds
2016-02-20 11:22:04	greduan	shuuuush, let me finish
2016-02-20 11:22:05	tm512	not a fact of reality
2016-02-20 11:22:06	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:23:58	tm512	this concept of an "I" that "inhabits" a body is just an illusion. fact is that the brain/nervous system is as much a part of the body as anything else and when the body dies so does the concept of "I" that the brain constructs
2016-02-20 11:24:21	tm512	dualism is complete bullshit
2016-02-20 11:24:44	greduan	then I got audited a bit, and I say audited, they didn't do mind control or any of what you guys probably consider auditing. I literally just sat in front of an auditor, and that auditor told me "give me that hand", and I gave him my hand, he says "thank you" and then he puts it back on my lap. Then you move on and you do another drill, where you put your hands against his and he moves them and
2016-02-20 11:24:45	greduan	you follow them, simple, then he does where he moves a book and you gotta replicate those movements
2016-02-20 11:25:21	tm512	you think you've arrived at these conclusions on your own but the fact is that everyone you were around was influencing your beliefs
2016-02-20 11:25:24	greduan	in one of those, I just completely closed my eyes, but I could somehow see him grab the book and move it. and I did it, and at certain points I opened my eyes and yep his hand was where I thought it was.
2016-02-20 11:25:25	tm512	and they've stuck
2016-02-20 11:26:03	fyr	greduan, do you realise how crazy you sound right now?
2016-02-20 11:26:07	greduan	fyr: I do
2016-02-20 11:26:19	fyr	that doesn't reassure me
2016-02-20 11:26:32	tm512	takes someone truly crazy to realize how crazy they are, but still continue believing it anyway
2016-02-20 11:27:05	greduan	there's one thing "sounding crazy" and "being crazy". People that thought the world was a sphere and not flat "sounded crazy", but were they? :)
2016-02-20 11:27:16	greduan	anyway I'm just telling you guys my experience
2016-02-20 11:27:17	tm512	there really isn't a point to this argument. I used to argue an awful lot about religion, primarily with christians, and the shit you're spewing is almost exactly the same
2016-02-20 11:27:30	greduan	except Christians try to convert you. lol
2016-02-20 11:27:44	tm512	so I have no reason to believe that this argument is any more worthwhile than any of the arguments I've had in the past
2016-02-20 11:28:04	greduan	I don't give a shit if you believe me or not, I'm just stating my point of view, and it'll probably end as soon as you just say "OK" and make me understand that you understood me, whether you agree with me or not that's something different though.
2016-02-20 11:28:26	fyr	I'd rather keep this place 'faith free' thanks
2016-02-20 11:28:37	greduan	why did this even come up?
2016-02-20 11:28:43	fyr	that way no one gets upset
2016-02-20 11:28:46	greduan	oh right vypr and buddhism and shit got out of control on my end
2016-02-20 11:28:58	greduan	man I just realized my language has been very aggressive, sorry
2016-02-20 11:29:10	greduan	I'm calm as can be but I realize now you guys can only see my text
2016-02-20 11:29:12	greduan	not my face
2016-02-20 11:29:44	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:30:01	greduan	I'm a Scientologist, you all don't need to believe me on anything, just stating my view. End of conversation.
2016-02-20 11:30:28	tm512	that's all arguments end up being
2016-02-20 11:30:34	tm512	just stating viewpoints
2016-02-20 11:30:36	greduan	arguments?
2016-02-20 11:30:38	tm512	and getting frustrated
2016-02-20 11:30:54	greduan	yeee
2016-02-20 11:30:58	fyr	greduan, WHAT
2016-02-20 11:31:03	greduan	fyr: ?
2016-02-20 11:31:12	fyr	you realise you are part of a cult right?
2016-02-20 11:31:19	greduan	oh you weren't here at the beginning
2016-02-20 11:31:27	greduan	scroll up where the subject came up
2016-02-20 11:31:35	fyr	I don't need to
2016-02-20 11:31:45	greduan	fuck it I'll state it again
2016-02-20 11:31:51	greduan	I am not part of the Church of Scientology
2016-02-20 11:31:59	tm512	really being part of any religious group is basically being a part of a cult
2016-02-20 11:32:05	greduan	Church of Scientology has virtually nothing to do with Scientology.
2016-02-20 11:32:08	greduan	tm512: +1
2016-02-20 11:32:09	fyr	it's still very culty
2016-02-20 11:32:19	tm512	cult and religious practice are almost synonyms
2016-02-20 11:32:24	greduan	yup
2016-02-20 11:32:51	tm512	it seems like greduan does not really practice religion, but rather just believes it, so I wouldn't say he's part of a cult
2016-02-20 11:32:58	greduan	lol
2016-02-20 11:33:16	tm512	unless I'm missing something
2016-02-20 11:33:48	greduan	nah you're right
2016-02-20 11:34:02	greduan	I just study it and practice some of it
2016-02-20 11:34:05	greduan	as in practice

2016-02-20 23:09:25	@z3bra	obviously
2016-02-20 23:11:21	@z3bra	just compiled it btw
2016-02-20 23:11:28	@z3bra	do you have "pango" installed?
2016-02-20 23:14:10	arc	yes
2016-02-20 23:16:19	@z3bra	then it should work

2016-02-21 04:03:51	stark	hup ?
2016-02-21 04:04:47	boobah	stark: do you know what rendering engine that html-to-pdf thing uses?
2016-02-21 04:06:20	stark	boobah, qtwebkit
2016-02-21 04:06:27	boobah	ah, thanks
2016-02-21 04:07:27	boobah	i was thinking of using it for a weather script. the script generates a html forecast view, sends it off to wkhtmltopdf and then prints the resulting pdf
2016-02-21 04:07:52	boobah	for my parent's house; they like having a print-out copy of the weather :P
2016-02-21 04:08:01	stark	lel 
2016-02-21 04:08:08	stark	I was about to ask why
2016-02-21 04:08:41	boobah	point being, i could use a qtwebkit browser for debugging and the output should look the same
2016-02-21 04:08:51	stark	i thought to myself  "wouldn't that be overkill for a status bar ..."
2016-02-21 04:09:06	boobah	haha, totally would
2016-02-21 04:10:30	stark	I have never printed under any *nix but there should be a command line utility that you can pipe the text to
2016-02-21 04:11:04	boobah	lp or lpr, part of CUPS
2016-02-21 04:11:22	boobah	iirc you can send pdfs directly. done it before.
2016-02-21 04:12:18	stark	but then again, in your case, your parents may prefer the fancy output ;D
2016-02-21 04:12:46	stark	Classic GUI vs TUI
2016-02-21 04:13:21	boobah	whaddya mean?
2016-02-21 04:13:46	boobah	this would all be automated for them, on a cron job. they would just collect the printed page from the printer each week.
2016-02-21 04:13:47	stark	"Where's the sun ?" "Come on Dad, can't you see this beautiful ASCII art of the sun ? ..."
2016-02-21 04:14:00	boobah	lol
2016-02-21 04:14:16	boobah	no, but that's the whole point of the HTML. i can make it look nice with images and fancy graphics and stuff.
2016-02-21 04:14:51	boobah	otherwise, sure, i could just print a .txt file. that's what i was thinking of doing before you pointed out the converter :)
2016-02-21 04:15:33	stark	Sure, whatever pleases :)

2016-02-21 04:51:50	fyr	hmm I wonder if there is a way to set a line of space between the status of tmux and the process
2016-02-21 04:55:31	boobah	fyr: `set force-height <single_window_height - 1>`
2016-02-21 04:55:36	boobah	but that's pretty hacky
2016-02-21 04:55:50	boobah	probably not what you want
2016-02-21 04:57:08	fyr	kinda...
2016-02-21 04:57:51	fyr	also <single_window_height - 1> bit isn't working
2016-02-21 04:58:16	boobah	you'd have to set it manually, it doesn't expand
2016-02-21 04:58:27	boobah	sucks, but it's the only thing coming up on google
2016-02-21 04:58:38	boobah	run tmux inside tmux :)
2016-02-21 04:58:50	fyr	!!
2016-02-21 04:59:18	boobah	\/
2016-02-21 04:59:31	boobah	yeah, that'd be awful
2016-02-21 05:01:17	arc	i run dtach inside tmux

2016-02-21 05:08:27	greduan	yo rocx I'm playing around with Emacs today
2016-02-21 05:10:06	arc	boobah: because it's useful
2016-02-21 05:10:28	arc	dtach detaches invididual applications, not sessions
2016-02-21 05:11:35	boobah	i see. i use dtach for my irc client. so you could still use tmux independently for multiplexing

2016-02-21 08:11:55	boobah	it was stated explicitl in the docs
2016-02-21 08:12:04	dcat	ah well
2016-02-21 08:12:16	dcat	command >output is POSIX
2016-02-21 08:12:53	boobah	to be fair, it wasn't advertising Bourne or POSIX complience. But I think we can all agree `> output command` takes a toll on legibility.
2016-02-21 08:13:23	dcat	which shell was it?
2016-02-21 08:13:29	boobah	"> out" or ">out" is personal preference. I prefer the former because I find it easier to read and, like I said, it works on the most platforms.
2016-02-21 08:13:37	boobah	hmmm...
2016-02-21 08:13:45	boobah	i don't remember tbh

2016-02-21 08:15:38	boobah	dcat: what's bs about it?
2016-02-21 08:16:04	@rocx	probably something about how bsd users are better at *nix things than GNU/Linux users.
2016-02-21 08:16:08	boobah	rocx: haha, didn't realize they renamed mirbsd
2016-02-21 08:16:19	@rocx	boobah: no clue, i've seen it used interchanged.
2016-02-21 08:16:23	dcat	I'm saying it sounds like bs

2016-02-21 08:17:40	boobah	Okay, well I'll say this

2016-02-21 08:18:14	%vypr	(in regards to the name of it)
2016-02-21 08:18:21	boobah	vypr: When did they change the name from MirBSD?
2016-02-21 08:18:28	boobah	dcat: It was an experimental shell, but the name is escaping me now. It had additional syntax features
2016-02-21 08:18:42	%vypr	they never did
2016-02-21 08:18:47	boobah	dcat: that allowed it to do special operations on stream redirection
2016-02-21 08:18:47	%vypr	they just used both
2016-02-21 08:19:03	%vypr	but the full official name is MirOS BSD

2016-02-21 08:19:26	dcat	I'm just pointing out that that story definitely sounds like bs
2016-02-21 08:19:48	@fro	what story
2016-02-21 08:19:53	@fro	i didn't read any of this shit
2016-02-21 08:19:58	dcat	rocx: what was the font that I liked so much
2016-02-21 08:20:16	boobah	dcat: so in order to make the parsing easy, they simply disallowed ">output", because the operators were to the tune of ">a output" for append, etc. You can see where they're coming from.
2016-02-21 08:20:41	boobah	fro: shell features that i'm currently talking about :P
2016-02-21 08:20:46	dcat	>">a output" for append
2016-02-21 08:21:02	@fro	so
2016-02-21 08:21:09	@fro	wouldn't this be documented somewhere?
2016-02-21 08:21:30	boobah	yeah, you can try googling if you like, but it was something kind of obscure.
2016-02-21 08:21:54	dcat	okay
2016-02-21 08:22:09	dcat	now I'm definitely going with the "gf in canada" thing
2016-02-21 08:22:37	boobah	I don't know what's so hard to believe about a one-man shell that uses ">a" for output appending
2016-02-21 08:22:43	@fro	unlike the gf in canada thing tho
2016-02-21 08:22:51	@fro	this would be mentioned somewhere

2016-02-21 08:32:02	@rocx	eh. the only advantage i could think of is the backlog idea. just scroll back a bit.

2016-02-21 08:43:24	@rocx	character, script, codepoints, instructions to input it, font, character code properties, and most importantly, the face property.
2016-02-21 08:44:22	@rocx	so if i ever need to figure out what a thing i need to change is called, run that on a region, and change its face.
2016-02-21 08:44:33	@rocx	eg. i do it over the "ERC>" text.
2016-02-21 08:45:10	@rocx	it's an erc-prompt, its face is "erc-prompt-face", it's a field, front-sticky, read-only, rear-nonsticky, and start-open... whatever those mean.

2016-02-22 09:50:14	@fro	did some guy break up with adam?
2016-02-22 09:50:20	@fro	or turn down his advances?
2016-02-22 09:50:22	fsociety	he can suck big vainy js dick
2016-02-22 09:50:37	josm	no, some idiot saying he's an idiot for not using js
2016-02-22 09:50:45	@fro	oh
2016-02-22 09:50:53	@fro	guess i'm an idiot too
2016-02-22 09:50:57	josm	I use node, but I don't got around saying "you idiot, use node"
2016-02-22 09:50:58	@fro	because i don't use js
2016-02-22 09:51:26	josm	according to that guy, yeah
2016-02-22 09:51:32	%vypr	josm: that's how _everything_ should be
2016-02-22 09:51:41	josm	vypr: indeed
2016-02-22 09:51:49	%vypr	i'm a buddhist, but i don't go around being cringey saying "CHRISTIANITY SUX"
2016-02-22 09:51:56	josm	exactly
2016-02-22 09:53:14	@fro	well it does suck
2016-02-22 09:53:30	%vypr	sure, but it's not my choice to choose what people believe
2016-02-22 09:53:44	%vypr	if they truly believe in it and they are happy with it, then who am i to judge
2016-02-22 09:53:48	greduan2	yall use ledger?
2016-02-22 09:53:54	@fro	if you're criticizing christianity itself then it shouldn't matter
2016-02-22 09:53:54	%vypr	greduan2: not since heath
2016-02-22 09:54:10	josm	vypr: savage
2016-02-22 09:54:17	greduan2	wut?
2016-02-22 09:54:26	%vypr	greduan2: you need to go outside more
2016-02-22 09:54:48	@fro	greduan doesn't wear deodorant
2016-02-22 09:54:55	@fro	he can't be trusted
2016-02-22 10:00:00		[09:54]
2016-02-22 10:05:56	@rocx	fro: criticizing christianity was how we have christianity as we know it today.
2016-02-22 10:11:00		[10:05]
2016-02-22 10:11:22	@fro	ok?
2016-02-22 10:12:02	@rocx	kay then.
2016-02-22 10:12:15	@rocx	holy crap i need to organize my ~/tmp.
2016-02-22 10:17:23	tm512	"criticizing christianity was how we have christianity as we know it today" << this doesn't make much sense
2016-02-22 10:17:39	%vypr	tm512: well
2016-02-22 10:17:45	%vypr	its accurate in a sense
2016-02-22 10:17:47	%vypr	not entirely, of course
2016-02-22 10:17:48	tm512	unless you're referring to how it's less popular than ever really
2016-02-22 10:18:02	@rocx	tm512: no. criticism is how we have the different branches.
2016-02-22 10:18:04	%vypr	criticism has shaped christianity throughout the years
2016-02-22 10:18:07	@rocx	like the 99 theses, for example.
2016-02-22 10:18:27	@rocx	granted that was more of criticism of the church, but that was still criticizing the very way of life.
2016-02-22 10:18:35	tm512	disagreement is how there are so many different branches of christianity
2016-02-22 10:18:55	@rocx	i'm also talking out of my rumpus so take these words with an atom of salt.
2016-02-22 10:19:23	@rocx	s/atom/molecule.
2016-02-22 10:21:07	fsociety	rocx: how was the party on saturday night
2016-02-22 10:21:13	@rocx	awesome.
2016-02-22 10:21:14	fsociety	was it sufficiently evil
2016-02-22 10:21:29	@rocx	yep. even the emperor's ghost showed up.
2016-02-22 10:22:39	fsociety	damn
2016-02-22 10:22:55	fsociety	i was so depressed i burnt the inside of my throat with pizza
2016-02-22 10:22:56	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 10:23:04	fsociety	actually that is what happened minus the depression
2016-02-22 10:23:45	%vypr	what did you do?
2016-02-22 10:23:54	%vypr	like eat the pizza immediately after it came out of the oven?
2016-02-22 10:24:16	fsociety	no, a bit of a pizza got stuck in my throat.. got lodged and it was burning the inside of my throat
2016-02-22 10:24:22	fsociety	quite painful
2016-02-22 10:24:24	%vypr	that's... not fun
2016-02-22 10:24:30	fsociety	yeah it isn't
2016-02-22 10:25:16	greduan2	just like how you have hot noodles/pasta and your slurping them and then they touch your chin and they're piping hot while for your mouth they're just hot
2016-02-22 10:25:17	greduan2	that sucks
2016-02-22 10:25:23	greduan2	not "just like"
2016-02-22 10:25:26	greduan2	but it's not fun either
2016-02-22 10:25:43	greduan2	rait guys?

2016-02-22 10:51:08	fyr	this argument on r/linux about ls output is hillarious
2016-02-22 10:51:33	@rocx	can programs tell when they're supposed to be piping?
2016-02-22 10:51:41	fyr	yes
2016-02-22 10:51:59	@rocx	if so, then having a pipable output when in a pipe is fine while having a more detailed/pretty output when solo.
2016-02-22 10:52:32	fyr	which is what this change is doing essentially

2016-02-22 11:21:23	@rocx	i don't see what the problem is.
2016-02-22 11:21:47	@rocx	certainly a lot more simpler to read in a listing 'testing one' than testing\ one
2016-02-22 11:22:13	@rocx	and it's not even there if you aren't a twit that puts spaces in your file names like a moron.
2016-02-22 11:22:42	@rocx	this is just people getting buttmad over a change.
2016-02-22 11:24:58	fyr	aye
2016-02-22 11:25:03	fyr	anyway
2016-02-22 11:25:03		[11:25]
2016-02-22 11:25:16	fyr	got lemonbar to print the command I want to execute to stdout
2016-02-22 11:25:27	%kirby	I thought one of the sacred rules was "don't parse ls"
2016-02-22 11:25:48	fyr	but how the hell do I get that string into /bin/sh
2016-02-22 11:25:50	fyr	grrrr
2016-02-22 11:25:55	%kirby	I don't like it because I don't see why it needs changing now when it's been fine for all these years
2016-02-22 11:26:09	%kirby	But there's never any need to parse ls

2016-02-22 11:29:26	@rocx	solution: don't use spaces in your file names.
2016-02-22 11:30:09	fsociety	which reminds me i'm going to write a notify-send python script using lemonbar.. thanks for reminding me
2016-02-22 11:30:12	fsociety	gonna do that tonight

2016-02-22 11:56:12	boobah	why
2016-02-22 11:56:35	fyr	I need a way to define var1, var2, var3 etc.. in a for loop
2016-02-22 11:56:44	fyr	on a single line
2016-02-22 11:56:54	fsociety	limitations of sh
2016-02-22 11:56:54		[11:56]
2016-02-22 11:56:56	boobah	you can see why bash has arrays and associative arrays :)
2016-02-22 11:57:07	boobah	just use a string with a delimiter
2016-02-22 11:57:29	boobah	and then just append with `var="${var} appended content"`
2016-02-22 11:57:31	fyr	let me send want I have currently

2016-02-22 11:59:12	boobah	fyr: yeah, you can't do that
2016-02-22 12:00:53	boobah	also watch out; your groupNum will only work if you have less than 10 groups, excluding 0
2016-02-22 12:00:54	fyr	boobah, that's the bit I need to work though :)

2016-02-22 12:01:45	boobah	fyr: i'd say use a space (' ') or whatever-delimited list and use `cut`
2016-02-22 12:02:09	fyr	yeah you're probably right
2016-02-22 12:02:41	fyr	hmm I'd rather use something other than a space though
2016-02-22 12:02:51	fyr	I hopefully want those preserved
2016-02-22 12:03:03	fyr	does cut work with tabs?
2016-02-22 12:03:06	boobah	yeah
2016-02-22 12:03:17	boobah	as long as it's a single character, it will work with cut.
2016-02-22 12:03:40	boobah	keep in mind it won't interpret '\t' for you, so set the delimiter literally
2016-02-22 12:03:57	boobah	i'll be back in a while; making dinner
2016-02-22 12:04:02	fyr	yeah cut -d\t -f ? right?

2016-02-22 13:27:47	skrzyp	just found notion wm, looks very good except a bit oldschool keybindings
2016-02-22 13:29:00	fyr	looked alittle inflexible for my liking
2016-02-22 13:30:22	skrzyp	I like the idea of manual tiling a lot
2016-02-22 13:36:00		[13:30]
2016-02-22 13:36:33	skrzyp	tfw I can barely read russian so I'm reading some russian bloga about notion wm which looks very popular there
2016-02-22 13:38:08	fsociety	i remember looking at notion
2016-02-22 13:38:16	fsociety	i'll never move from bspwm unfortunately
2016-02-22 13:41:59	fyr	!!!
2016-02-22 13:42:06	fyr	traitor to the wmutils
2016-02-22 13:42:25	josm	I should get around to using wmutils
2016-02-22 13:42:27	fsociety	you make it binary partition tile and i'll use it
2016-02-22 13:42:35	fyr	:(
2016-02-22 13:42:48	boobah	fyr: glad you're getting somewhere
2016-02-22 13:42:55	fyr	it's gotta just be done in C
2016-02-22 13:43:04	fsociety	does it really hav to be done in C
2016-02-22 13:43:09	fsociety	or can it be done in any language
2016-02-22 13:43:16	fyr	for it not to be horribly slow?
2016-02-22 13:43:16	boobah	if you're doing it in c, might as well just write a wm with libwm
2016-02-22 13:43:32	boobah	no point hacking together with wmutils unless it's gonna be scripts
2016-02-22 13:43:41	fyr	I still don't know the algoritm for it either
2016-02-22 13:44:00	boobah	isn't binary partitioning just being able to split tiles in half?
2016-02-22 13:44:05	fsociety	correct
2016-02-22 13:44:08	fyr	essentially
2016-02-22 13:44:33	boobah	i guess it's not so straightforward... ask baskerville :)
2016-02-22 13:44:42	fsociety	that is what i was gonna say
2016-02-22 13:44:45	fsociety	baskerville is the man to ask
2016-02-22 13:44:53	skrzyp	I like binary partitioning
2016-02-22 13:44:54	fyr	i'll probably end up at looking at the source code for bspwm anyway
2016-02-22 13:45:04	skrzyp	when it means splitting empty frames
2016-02-22 13:45:07	boobah	it's really a shame there are so few manual tilers/hybrid out there
2016-02-22 13:45:15	skrzyp	where I can drop my future windows
2016-02-22 13:45:25	boobah	like herbstluft
2016-02-22 13:45:31	skrzyp	and notion
2016-02-22 13:45:37	fyr	yeah if we got a script working well with wmutils it really would be the best of both worlds
2016-02-22 13:45:38	skrzyp	but herbstluftwm had some issues
2016-02-22 13:45:48	boobah	yeah i ended up ditching it too
2016-02-22 13:45:52	skrzyp	and I want to check out something else
2016-02-22 13:46:01	fsociety	i mean wmutils is still on my work machine, but when i get tons of windows happening, it starts to become a bit of nightmare
2016-02-22 13:46:21	boobah	what i also realized is that i never have more than 4 windows in a single desktop anyway
2016-02-22 13:46:33	fyr	yeah it really is designed for you to be managing it with groups effectively
2016-02-22 13:46:33	boobah	at a certain point, the windows are too small to be usable
2016-02-22 13:46:50	fsociety	fyr: oh i was using groups
2016-02-22 13:46:56	fsociety	still became a bit of a nightmare
2016-02-22 13:46:56	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 13:46:59	boobah	hehe, i should get into grouping/tagging
2016-02-22 13:47:13	boobah	still on the ancient virtual desktop paradigm
2016-02-22 13:47:17	fyr	fsociety, yeah because you have to remember where a window is ...
2016-02-22 13:47:29	fyr	and then position it effectively
2016-02-22 13:48:23	boobah	another thing, is that once you have more than a few windows on-screen, it becomes tiresome to ADDRESS the windows. Either hitting mod-tab or mod-j/k a bunch of times
2016-02-22 13:49:39	fyr	that too
2016-02-22 13:49:57	fyr	but I think that is very true of ANY keyboard driven wm
2016-02-22 13:50:11	fsociety	see using it my work machine is great because its a really old machine.
2016-02-22 13:50:32	fsociety	the only thing i use the mouse these days is just moving it to manually focus a window
2016-02-22 13:50:32	boobah	fyr: yeah, it is. just felt like saying it :)
2016-02-22 13:50:32	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 13:50:42	fyr	yeah, no resources to use wmutils at all...
2016-02-22 13:50:54	fyr	boobah, I see ^^
2016-02-22 13:51:13	boobah	fsociety: i only use mine for the webbrowser. hints don't work properly half the time.
2016-02-22 13:51:13		[13:51]
2016-02-22 13:51:53	fyr	boobah, what are you using?
2016-02-22 13:54:06	fyr	http://pub.iotek.org/p/EpuLJYU
2016-02-22 13:54:10	boobah	monsterwm-xcb :P
2016-02-22 13:55:02	fyr	well I was more refering to the plugin :D
2016-02-22 13:55:07	fsociety	what is that link
2016-02-22 13:55:14	fyr	a webm
2016-02-22 13:55:25	fsociety	ahh.. came up as a bin in firefox
2016-02-22 13:55:36	boobah	nice, glad it's working. also +1 for mosh.
2016-02-22 13:55:36	fyr	fuck firefox
2016-02-22 13:55:42	josm	man fyr why you gotta make me jealous
2016-02-22 13:55:49	boobah	fyr: oh, sorry. an ancient commit of jumanji.
2016-02-22 13:55:51	josm	nice setup
2016-02-22 13:55:52	fyr	josm, sorry :(
2016-02-22 13:56:11	fyr	bar is somewhat lacking to say the least right now
2016-02-22 13:57:04	fyr	want a way to assign windows to a group now
2016-02-22 13:57:14	fyr	but that is probably enough for tonight I sense
2016-02-22 13:57:27	fsociety	you are tiling again fyr 
2016-02-22 13:57:39	fyr	fsociety, nope, that's just how I 'snap' my windows
2016-02-22 13:57:43	fyr	sec
2016-02-22 13:58:04	boobah	fyr: what's your streaming music player? pms?
2016-02-22 13:58:13	fsociety	but thats a great little webm
2016-02-22 13:58:25	fyr	boobah, mps-youtube
2016-02-22 13:58:32	fyr	fsociety, http://pub.iotek.org/p/mLm9633
2016-02-22 13:58:34	fsociety	my lastest desktop screenie is /r/unixporn from the other day
2016-02-22 13:58:41	fsociety	is on /r/unixporn*
2016-02-22 13:58:55	fyr	it 'snaps' to the grid in the sense
2016-02-22 13:58:59	fsociety	but it aint wmutils
2016-02-22 13:59:05	fyr	yeah :(
2016-02-22 13:59:10	fsociety	fyr = wmutils 4 lyfe
2016-02-22 13:59:14	fyr	nice screenie though
2016-02-22 13:59:29	fsociety	i do like what you have done though
2016-02-22 13:59:34	fyr	i swear people only upvote you for the massive monitors :D
2016-02-22 13:59:36	fsociety	i need to get a copy of your tmux config
2016-02-22 13:59:42	fsociety	fyr: probably
2016-02-22 13:59:58	fsociety	i always wondered why people always upvote me so much
2016-02-22 14:00:00	fsociety	i just don't get it
2016-02-22 14:00:08	fsociety	even deviantart people do the same thing
2016-02-22 14:00:11	fyr	all terminals, nice colors clean bar
2016-02-22 14:00:53	fsociety	trust my little linux meet up in melbourne with a few people, im always the butt of a joke. you have 32gb of ram and you run that
2016-02-22 14:01:05	fsociety	trust me* 
2016-02-22 14:01:06	fyr	lol
2016-02-22 14:01:23	fsociety	i guess the other dimms of ram are feeling lonely
2016-02-22 14:01:34	boobah	fsociety: is that 2x u3415 or something? jesus
2016-02-22 14:01:43	fyr	I could run my config on 2gb's only
2016-02-22 14:01:55	fyr	even less probably
2016-02-22 14:02:27	boobah	back when i used wmutils i was on a machine with 512 MB
2016-02-22 14:02:29	fyr	I am only using 2 gigs even with chrome and 20+ tabs open
2016-02-22 14:02:54	fsociety	boobah: http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/monitor-printer/monitor/curved-monitor/LS34E790CNS/XY
2016-02-22 14:03:01	fsociety	thats what i use
2016-02-22 14:03:23	fsociety	so have that tiny font fyr uses from artwiz is impossible on this monitor
2016-02-22 14:03:26	fsociety	i wish i could use it
2016-02-22 14:03:36	fyr	yeah :/
2016-02-22 14:03:45	fyr	I'm scaried when I do get a new monitor
2016-02-22 14:03:58	fyr	my font *might* be unreadable
2016-02-22 14:04:11	fsociety	if its any higher than 1080p it becomes a bit too small
2016-02-22 14:04:18	fyr	I bet
2016-02-22 14:04:33	boobah	i fear this also. when the time comes for me to go high-dpi, i'll probably just remake all my fonts into larger, more detailed versions
2016-02-22 14:04:35	fyr	although it's more to do with pixel density than resoloution
2016-02-22 14:04:41	boobah	i mean, i use my own fonts already
2016-02-22 14:04:51	fsociety	boobah: can i see these fonts
2016-02-22 14:05:34	boobah	let me find a picture, hang on
2016-02-22 14:06:05	fyr	mhm I should get writing my windows.sh script
2016-02-22 14:06:15	fyr	it's been sitting there as a shell for far too long
2016-02-22 14:06:15		[14:06]
2016-02-22 14:06:25	fyr	and I need features wgroups doesn't really provide
2016-02-22 14:09:28	fsociety	you should include a panel as part of your wm suite :)
2016-02-22 14:09:32	boobah	fsociety: http://pub.iotek.org/p/v2HOYEC.png
2016-02-22 14:09:57	fyr	holy
2016-02-22 14:10:07	fyr	people complain about lemon being unreadable lol
2016-02-22 14:10:19	@rocx	they're both unreadable. let's solve that argument.
2016-02-22 14:10:24	boobah	it's quite readable, actually. it's just small.
2016-02-22 14:10:27	josm	lemon best font
2016-02-22 14:10:33	fsociety	i use a modified terminus font called terminus12
2016-02-22 14:10:39	josm	uushi is..more readable I suppose
2016-02-22 14:10:46	boobah	wanna see my 3x5 font?
2016-02-22 14:10:49	josm	I use envypn for my terminals
2016-02-22 14:10:51	fsociety	sure
2016-02-22 14:10:54	boobah	you guys will shit your pants
2016-02-22 14:11:07	fyr	uushi is too wide
2016-02-22 14:11:22	josm	true
2016-02-22 14:11:27	josm	I wanted to use creep
2016-02-22 14:11:51	@fro	hrm
2016-02-22 14:11:57	josm	envypn will do though
2016-02-22 14:11:58	boobah	I actually used this full-time for a week, but then my eyes hurt and I went back to the other one: http://pub.iotek.org/p/ScCBDaJ.png
2016-02-22 14:12:03	@fro	is creep the one with the weird f
2016-02-22 14:12:11	josm	wtf boobah
2016-02-22 14:12:16	josm	that IS unreadable
2016-02-22 14:12:19	fyr	omg
2016-02-22 14:12:20	@fro	how the fuck can you see that
2016-02-22 14:12:21	@fro	haha
2016-02-22 14:12:35	boobah	on a 100 PPI monitor it's not too bad
2016-02-22 14:12:37	fyr	talk about trying to maximise space
2016-02-22 14:12:51	@fro	jesus
2016-02-22 14:12:55	boobah	yeah it was ridiculous. i had so much terminal space.
2016-02-22 14:12:57	josm	fyr: https://github.com/romeovs/creep
2016-02-22 14:13:00	josm	that's creep
2016-02-22 14:13:11	@fro	yeah see
2016-02-22 14:13:18	@fro	creep is perfect except for that f
2016-02-22 14:13:22	@fro	that f irritates me
2016-02-22 14:13:28	boobah	change it
2016-02-22 14:13:33	@fro	pass
2016-02-22 14:13:38	josm	I kinda like it tbh
2016-02-22 14:13:43	%vypr	oob
2016-02-22 14:13:47	fyr	yeah creep is too small for me personally
2016-02-22 14:13:50	fsociety	i actually like the look of creep
2016-02-22 14:14:00	fsociety	though i dare say putting it on a 2k monitor would be hell
2016-02-22 14:14:26	fsociety	though this could be good for netbook
2016-02-22 14:14:49	boobah	i started with lemon, then modded it and called it "lumen", then just recreated it from scratch and called it "bitterm", which is the first link I posted above.
2016-02-22 14:14:57	@fro	my screen is only 12.5"
2016-02-22 14:15:10	@fro	and low res
2016-02-22 14:15:13	josm	my monitors are 22" so it's fine for me
2016-02-22 14:15:22	@fro	i could use a smaller font
2016-02-22 14:15:22	josm	but as I said, I use envypn in my terms
2016-02-22 14:15:26	@fro	but i dunno
2016-02-22 14:15:41	fsociety	any recommendations on a distro for a netbook - fyr: will say crux
2016-02-22 14:15:50	boobah	not crux for fuck's sake
2016-02-22 14:15:55	@fro	openbsd
2016-02-22 14:15:58	fyr	crux!
2016-02-22 14:16:00	josm	alpine? void?
2016-02-22 14:16:02	fsociety	hahahaha
2016-02-22 14:16:08	fyr	honestly though
2016-02-22 14:16:10	boobah	void, if you don't mind gnu.
2016-02-22 14:16:19	fyr	void, or openbsd
2016-02-22 14:16:29	fyr	debian if you want super stable
2016-02-22 14:16:33	fsociety	i think i might the go the bsd route for something different
2016-02-22 14:16:53	josm	good idea
2016-02-22 14:16:58	boobah	just make sure it's not source-based. compiling huge packages on an Intel Atom or whatever is going to be hell.
2016-02-22 14:17:09	josm	I still need to try any bsd for myself
2016-02-22 14:17:20	fsociety	yeah i know, i was considering gentoo then though it would take a month of compiling
2016-02-22 14:17:26	fsociety	bsd os recommendations?
2016-02-22 14:17:33	fyr	boobah, not if you make packages on a more powerful machine then export them :)
2016-02-22 14:18:18	boobah	fyr: yeah, i guess so. does crux have a native binary packaging system?
2016-02-22 14:19:28	fyr	well it makes a 'pkg.tar.gz' which you can then install using pkgadd
2016-02-22 14:19:45	fyr	as long as you used portable make flags ofc
2016-02-22 14:20:04	 < 	kirby (alex@7338E425.FAA08BA3.9A5EAAF5.IP) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2016-02-22 14:20:48	boobah	fyr: so it puts all the binaries in the tarball?
2016-02-22 14:21:04	boobah	all the binaries for that specific package, i mean obviously
2016-02-22 14:21:46	fyr	yeah
2016-02-22 14:21:46		[14:21]
2016-02-22 14:22:06	fyr	you just specify the DESTDIR in the pkgfile itself
2016-02-22 14:22:21	fyr	usually 'make DESTDIR=$PKG install'
2016-02-22 14:22:59	boobah	thats cool
2016-02-22 14:23:59	fsociety	*cough*
2016-02-22 14:24:02	fsociety	bsd recommendations
2016-02-22 14:24:11	fsociety	maybe i should go one of those extremely suckless linux distros
2016-02-22 14:24:12	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-22 14:25:33	boobah	does openbsd have problems with laptop battery life, or just performance in general?
2016-02-22 14:26:06	fyr	fsociety, if you come to crux we can be crux buddies!!
2016-02-22 14:26:16	fsociety	are you willing to help me install it
2016-02-22 14:26:20	fyr	sure
2016-02-22 14:26:30	fsociety	alright.. i'll download the iso then
2016-02-22 14:26:44	fyr	sweet
2016-02-22 14:26:48	fyr	grab the torrent
2016-02-22 14:26:57	fsociety	it will be my task for this evening when i get home from work.. but i'll download it remotely now

2016-02-22 14:29:20	fsociety	if i find it worthy i may put it on my i7
2016-02-22 14:29:31	fsociety	but im enjoying gentoo atm
2016-02-22 14:29:45	fyr	gentoo too complicated for a source distro
2016-02-22 14:29:58	fyr	you eventually just want to get on with your life
2016-02-22 14:30:16	fsociety	but isn't crux more difficult to install?
2016-02-22 14:30:35	boobah	gentoo has better documentation, i'd say
2016-02-22 14:30:37	fyr	I've never done the gentoo install so I can't compare directly
2016-02-22 14:30:55	thlst	i want to use crux, but i love pacman :c
2016-02-22 14:30:57	fyr	the bulk of crux install is compiling the kernel
2016-02-22 14:30:59	fsociety	yeah it does.. crux for me was like "so where is the doco? oh thats the doco.. oh god"
2016-02-22 14:31:05	boobah	thlst: put pacman on crux
2016-02-22 14:31:08	fyr	if you already have an image it's a cakewalk
2016-02-22 14:31:23	boobah	i did gentoo once just to say i did it. i wasn't particularly interested in portage or anything, so i never used it
2016-02-22 14:31:36	fyr	gentoo's docs are pretty good
2016-02-22 14:31:50	fyr	I wish the crux wiki was on a more modern wiki system..
2016-02-22 14:32:01	fyr	it's so ancient and unfriendly to edit
2016-02-22 14:32:04	boobah	gentoo has/had a larger userbase of course
2016-02-22 14:32:06	fsociety	i think if crux had a more modern wiki it would be utilised more
2016-02-22 14:32:32	fsociety	or you could go funtoo with a much smaller userbase, and its designed to make gentoo much simplier
2016-02-22 14:33:15	boobah	still though, portage is a giant python script
2016-02-22 14:33:26	fsociety	that it is
2016-02-22 14:34:05	boobah	not meaning to bash it though, funtoo's been on my "to try" list
2016-02-22 14:34:22	fsociety	i used it for a while
2016-02-22 14:34:31	fsociety	has a really small tight nit community to it
2016-02-22 14:35:02	fsociety	unfortunately i kept grabbing ebuilds from gentoo's git and putting them in mine, cause i was impatient getting certain releases
2016-02-22 14:35:09	fsociety	so i just ended up installing gentoo
2016-02-22 14:35:25	boobah	neat. i'm still kind of bummed we have to share a kernel with all the ubuntu/mint normies
2016-02-22 14:35:39	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-22 14:35:48	boobah	i feel like an asshole, but i keep wanting to move away from linux for this reason
2016-02-22 14:35:53	fsociety	those *buntu hipsters
2016-02-22 14:36:10	boobah	but then... linux does almost everything better so i stay
2016-02-22 14:36:58	fsociety	the main reason i moved to linux back in 2007 was i wanted to know what my computer was doing. i was getting tired of microsoft obfuscating everything
2016-02-22 14:36:58		[14:36]
2016-02-22 14:37:22	boobah	that is also why i moved
2016-02-22 14:37:24	fsociety	also i came from the niche computer era days where you had to type code listings to play video games. so linux appealed to me purely because of that
2016-02-22 14:37:27	fyr	that's exactly why I moved just over 3 months ago

2016-02-22 14:39:52	fsociety	a lot of the listing would have a lot of asm code you would inject into the basic code listings

2016-02-22 15:09:03	skrzyp	and after soldering, I can recommend you to fix it with epoxy glue
2016-02-22 15:09:11	boobah	hehe, yeah. i might have to get creative and solder wires into the battery compartment bed-of-nails pads :)
2016-02-22 15:09:17	@rocx	"Service ABS System" comes up a lot in it.
2016-02-22 15:09:25	boobah	rocx: lol
2016-02-22 15:09:29	skrzyp	but the problem with n900 is that its keyboard is not so good, and there's no space for altgr there
2016-02-22 15:09:31	@rocx	first time this happened, we got it checked and the ABS was good.
2016-02-22 15:09:36	fsociety	fyr: i never had any issues with pacman
2016-02-22 15:09:41	@rocx	second time, it was determined it was a light and it was said it was fixed.
2016-02-22 15:09:45	fyr	fsociety, lucky
2016-02-22 15:09:49	@rocx	now i don't trust "Service ABS System" lights.
2016-02-22 15:10:26	fsociety	i used arch for years, but bored because i wanted to know how linux actually worked which is why i installed gentoo
2016-02-22 15:10:31	boobah	rocx: i'm buying a car at the beginning of the summer, and i CAN'T WAIT.
2016-02-22 15:10:49	@rocx	get a car, not a van.
2016-02-22 15:10:54	boobah	of course :)
2016-02-22 15:11:00	@rocx	a van/truck are one of those things that you'll never need until you need one.
2016-02-22 15:11:09	fsociety	i need one cause i play drums
2016-02-22 15:11:10	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 15:11:25	fsociety	drums + van = mandatory
2016-02-22 15:11:26	@rocx	fsociety: coworker back at my old job managed to carry their drums around in a geo metro.
2016-02-22 15:11:28	boobah	i feel you. i think a hatchback or small wagon is best for me considering what i haul around.
2016-02-22 15:11:42	fsociety	i can fit my kit in a suzuki alto
2016-02-22 15:11:42	@rocx	they're apparently roomier than they appear.

2016-02-22 15:19:57	fsociety	here is a question, what browsers do you recommend
2016-02-22 15:20:13	fsociety	i tried qutebrowser and vimb, but webkit just likes to segfault occasionally
2016-02-22 15:20:15	boobah	absolutely none at all.
2016-02-22 15:20:24	fsociety	boobah: do you telnet? ;)
2016-02-22 15:20:27	fsociety	are you doing an rms
2016-02-22 15:20:41	boobah	hehe, no i don't read my email with wget
2016-02-22 15:21:04	boobah	but seriously every browser in current existence is terrible in one way or another
2016-02-22 15:21:11	fsociety	yeah i know
2016-02-22 15:21:17	fsociety	it's painful
2016-02-22 15:21:58	boobah	i wish i was skilled enough to write a web rendering engine
2016-02-22 15:22:10	boobah	then i could end the suffering, for nixers at least
2016-02-22 15:22:27	fsociety	i tried palemoon, but vimperator and pendactyl don't work properly in it
2016-02-22 15:22:27		[15:22]
2016-02-22 15:23:28	boobah	there are webkit browsers with decent interfaces, but webkit itself sucks ass
2016-02-22 15:23:37	fsociety	yeah i know
2016-02-22 15:23:46	fsociety	its slow, painful and takes 3 years to compile
2016-02-22 15:23:54	boobah	yep!
2016-02-22 15:24:31	boobah	too bad the web evolved. making a gopher client is easy.
2016-02-22 15:24:39	@rocx	yeah. i still need to make my own.
2016-02-22 15:24:54	boobah	rocx: your own gopher client?
2016-02-22 15:24:56	@rocx	yeah.
2016-02-22 15:25:15	boobah	you could, but there are some decent ones out there
2016-02-22 15:25:21	@rocx	i already got the downloading tidbit down pat. now comes the issue to make it interactive.

2016-02-22 15:25:41	@rocx	yeah. it's a project as i learn how to make an interactive major mode.
2016-02-22 15:25:45	@rocx	Elisp.
2016-02-22 15:25:56	boobah	oh, wow. good for you man!
2016-02-22 15:26:38	@rocx	but for now, i'm working on Çefrai.
2016-02-22 15:27:29	boobah	that came up for me as '?efrai'. what?
2016-02-22 15:27:49	@rocx	that means you should be using a proper font.
2016-02-22 15:28:01	tm512	or proper encoding
2016-02-22 15:28:10	@rocx	either way...
2016-02-22 15:28:11	@rocx	it was a C with a cedilla.
2016-02-22 15:28:12	boobah	it's not the font. it's something to do with my ssh connection and locale
2016-02-22 15:28:24	boobah	or character encoding
2016-02-22 15:28:58	boobah	rocx: what is that?
2016-02-22 15:29:01	@rocx	just making my own language for an artistic purpose.
2016-02-22 15:29:31	boobah	cool. i drafted a replacement C-language syntax a few months ago
2016-02-22 15:29:40	boobah	just to be artsy i guess

2016-02-22 15:31:13	@rocx	yeah. got several in the works for that comic.
2016-02-22 15:31:36	@rocx	this one i think is heading in the direction of the Portuguese language after finding out about it.
2016-02-22 15:31:36	boobah	neat. you taking linguistics or anything?
2016-02-22 15:31:42	@rocx	no. self-teaching this.

2016-02-22 15:31:57	@rocx	then there's the japanese-like Yakuwa.
2016-02-22 15:32:31	fsociety	i just tried this creep font
2016-02-22 15:32:34	fsociety	so hard to read
2016-02-22 15:32:56	boobah	fsociety: i can imagine it's pretty small on your displays
2016-02-22 15:33:05	fsociety	im trying it on my work machine
2016-02-22 15:33:09	fsociety	which is a 21" 1080p monitor
2016-02-22 15:33:21	@rocx	but besides that, there was "Komon", aka English, for the old RP sessions that we did but throw whatever alternative alphabets we could.
2016-02-22 15:33:21	@rocx	Hellenistic used Deseret, F'z used Elian, Elven used Tengwar, etc.
2016-02-22 15:33:56	boobah	fsociety: i know "fsociety" is a mr. robot reference, but i haven't watched the show. does it mean "fuck society" or what?
2016-02-22 15:34:10	fsociety	it can mean two things
2016-02-22 15:34:14	fsociety	fuck society or free society
2016-02-22 15:34:28	boobah	oh cool
2016-02-22 15:34:28	@rocx	or it could just be "fsociety", like "fnord".

2016-02-22 15:44:45	fsociety	i read a book about the multimedia department of microsoft in the mid 90s.  so many contract programmers deliberately put bugs in their code because they hated how they were treated
2016-02-22 15:44:47	@rocx	if i worked at MS, i'd be trying to get high to pass the day away.
2016-02-22 15:44:54	boobah	rocx: hah, me too
2016-02-22 15:45:19	boobah	fsociety: woowww. yeah i'm really glad i ditched using microsoft products years ago.

2016-02-22 15:46:34	fsociety	i remember in this book, i have to find it again.  so many programmers but crippling bugs in microsoft encarta that they delayed the release
2016-02-22 15:46:34	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 15:46:51	fsociety	naaa.. one programmer put in easter eggs about how shit microsoft was

2016-02-22 16:04:21	Lola	I intended to write a simple cronjob that backs up my homedir every night, I'm now halfway through recompiling acpi and I have no idea why
2016-02-22 16:04:57	Lola	I mean books count as documentation don't they? So most programmers would be terrible at them
2016-02-22 16:07:43	fsociety	haha.. the moment when your boss goes "can you document that please?" and they run screaming
2016-02-22 16:10:31	Lola	it's not as bad as when you need to use someone else's code that isn't documented

2016-02-23 04:10:12	fyr	well want it to be done automatically
2016-02-23 04:10:18	fyr	using set-titles-string so far
2016-02-23 04:10:21	fyr	that works fine

2016-02-23 04:28:25	fsociety	morning
2016-02-23 04:28:35	fsociety	seems qutebrowser has become a lot more stabler recently
2016-02-23 04:28:36	fsociety	excellent
2016-02-23 04:29:31	fsociety	oo. and supports wayland thats interesting
2016-02-23 04:30:45	greduan2	based on webkit right?
2016-02-23 04:30:55	fsociety	unfortunately, but its the most stable of the lot that use it
2016-02-23 04:30:57	@rocx	what isn't these days?
2016-02-23 04:31:05	greduan2	that's why I didn't use it, cause I tried it out on a source-based distro.
2016-02-23 04:31:10	greduan2	and webkit takes *ages* to compile
2016-02-23 04:31:15	fyr	this
2016-02-23 04:31:17	greduan2	I gave it 5 hours, didn't finish compiling
2016-02-23 04:31:24	greduan2	Firefox compiles in 1, tops
2016-02-23 04:31:28	fyr	you thought compiling firefox was bad!
2016-02-23 04:31:28	greduan2	for me
2016-02-23 04:31:36	greduan2	with my super old computer from 2007
2016-02-23 04:32:10	greduan2	witha  modern computer Firefox would probs take me 30 mins to compile
2016-02-23 04:32:18	greduan2	webkit would probably still take me more than 5 hours
2016-02-23 04:32:27	greduan2	I feel bad for those people that have to compile that shit daily lol
2016-02-23 04:32:43	@rocx	they probably distribute-compile it.
2016-02-23 04:33:52	@rocx	holy crap i hate this government class.
2016-02-23 04:34:06	greduan2	is that a citizen class or a school class
2016-02-23 04:34:07	greduan2	?
2016-02-23 04:34:10	@rocx	school class.
2016-02-23 04:34:28	@rocx	we never cover anything in class because "it encourages us to read".
2016-02-23 04:34:33	greduan2	government class : pompous know-nothings bout internet
2016-02-23 04:34:40	@rocx	heck, random questions of GA gov. on these quizzes.

2016-02-23 04:37:05	greduan2	listening to Panic! At The Disco, can't see what all the rage is all about, except for one cool song. lol
2016-02-23 04:38:23	fyr	dcat, z3bra: how are window id's generated, or where do you get them from?
2016-02-23 04:38:26	fsociety	i've been stuck listening to the band Textures for the past few weeks
2016-02-23 04:38:35	fsociety	new album was released, and well its on heavy rotation
2016-02-23 04:38:37	@xero	fyr: for tmux title try: printf '\033k┐(T_T)┌\033\'
2016-02-23 04:40:04	fyr	xero, I've got a somewhat cleaner solution
2016-02-23 04:40:12	greduan2	http://cute-jumper.github.io/emacs/2016/02/22/my-simple-setup-to-avoid-rsi-in-emacs
2016-02-23 04:40:30	fyr	just do set-titles-string "tmux: #T"
2016-02-23 04:40:40	fyr	#T refering to the window title
2016-02-23 04:40:53	fyr	so individual programs can still set the title and send their data that way
2016-02-23 04:40:58	@rocx	greduan2: C-g kind of became embedded in memory.
2016-02-23 04:42:41	greduan2	Yeah IKR
2016-02-23 04:42:41		[04:42]
2016-02-23 04:42:51	greduan2	I sometimes use than in Vim after a couple days of Emacs
2016-02-23 04:43:01	greduan2	in Emacs I tend to use ESC after months of using Vim. lol
2016-02-23 04:43:22	@rocx	ESC-ESC-ESC gets you out of other things too if you're bent on escape.
2016-02-23 04:43:31	greduan2	esc esc esc, oh wait this is Emacs, C-g (esc C-g is no a valid bind), C-g boom
2016-02-23 04:43:47	@rocx	C-g C-g
2016-02-23 04:43:57	@rocx	simple as tapping `g' twice.
2016-02-23 04:44:26	@rocx	oh okay then they talk about hydra.
2016-02-23 04:44:36	@rocx	still not 100% sure what hydra is.
2016-02-23 04:44:42	@xero	HAIL HYDRA!
2016-02-23 04:45:54	greduan2	Hydra is like a prefix bind afaict
2016-02-23 04:46:09	greduan2	I.e. C-z and you can set that up so it's a hydra bind
2016-02-23 04:46:27	@rocx	huh. so kind of like all these leader things for vim/evil?
2016-02-23 04:46:30	greduan2	which means you press C-z a a a a a and that's like pressing C-z C-a C-z C-a etc. etc., for example
2016-02-23 04:46:42	@rocx	oh.
2016-02-23 04:46:45	greduan2	which means you can setup movement binds very effectively with that
2016-02-23 04:46:55	greduan2	afaict iirc
2016-02-23 04:47:05	greduan2	I never implemented it in my own setup properly
2016-02-23 04:47:25	greduan2	but I want to implement a minimal vim mode (for movement) with hydra
2016-02-23 04:48:06	sbrg	yeah, that's pretty accurate. 
2016-02-23 04:48:28	sbrg	you go into a 'mode' after running a hydra so that you can hit the keys repeatedly until you hit a key that is not part of the 'hydra', then it exits
2016-02-23 04:48:33	sbrg	I use it for resizing windows and stuff. 
2016-02-23 04:49:23	greduan2	yeah so it's to enter specific flows
2016-02-23 04:49:32	greduan2	manipulation very repetetive stuff for example
2016-02-23 04:49:57	greduan2	repetitive or repetetive?
2016-02-23 04:50:03	greduan2	both look wrong
2016-02-23 04:51:33	sbrg	repetitive. 
2016-02-23 04:51:46	greduan2	oooooooh, dick move Panic! At The Disco. You used a Chicago opening in your song

2016-02-23 05:34:09	fsociety	haha
2016-02-23 05:34:13	dcat	:<
2016-02-23 05:34:22	dcat	it's only worthy of shit hardware
2016-02-23 05:34:26	dcat	evn moar cri
2016-02-23 05:34:47	fsociety	so i guess i use bspwm/wmutils
2016-02-23 05:34:50	fsociety	depending on the box :)
2016-02-23 05:34:54	dcat	lel
2016-02-23 05:34:57	dcat	which OS?
2016-02-23 05:35:02	dcat	and kernel
2016-02-23 05:35:11	fsociety	arch on work pc, gentoo on this one.. both are running 4.4.2
2016-02-23 05:35:50	dcat	ah cool
2016-02-23 05:36:14	fsociety	wmutils doesn't lend itself to large monitors
2016-02-23 05:36:15	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-23 05:36:30	dcat	how so?
2016-02-23 05:36:56	fsociety	for me personally had issues with fullscreening occasionally
2016-02-23 05:37:14	fsociety	mostly firefox
2016-02-23 05:37:21	fsociety	but thats probably a scripting thing
2016-02-23 05:38:25	dcat	hrm
2016-02-23 05:40:20	greduan2	I'd love multiple monitor support from wmutils :>
2016-02-23 05:40:29	greduan2	iirc it didn't have it,r ight?
2016-02-23 05:41:13	fsociety	dylan112 figured it out if you like at his gits, might have to back a month or so in commits to find it
2016-02-23 05:41:36	dcat	I don't really see how it doesn't work with multiple monitors
2016-02-23 05:41:43	fsociety	https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles
2016-02-23 05:45:36	dcat	fsociety: what would you want to change?
2016-02-23 05:45:42	@xero	i kinda like how laserwald is doing things: https://github.com/laserswald/backflip
2016-02-23 05:46:17	@xero	see: geo_disp.sh, current_disp.sh, and geo_disp.sh
2016-02-23 05:46:57	@xero	his fullscreen script only maximized the currently focused screen: https://github.com/laserswald/backflip/blob/master/fullscreen_disp.sh
2016-02-23 05:46:57		[05:46]
2016-02-23 05:47:00	fsociety	does anyone know how to solve this hinting issue with github
2016-02-23 05:47:01	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/SQdLD.png
2016-02-23 05:47:17	josm	maybe it's qutebrowser?
2016-02-23 05:47:25	josm	I don't get that with chromium
2016-02-23 05:47:28	fsociety	its every webkit browser
2016-02-23 05:47:33	josm	huh
2016-02-23 05:47:40	dcat	fsociety: where are you and dylan from?
2016-02-23 05:47:50	fsociety	firefox is fine, but if i use vimb, qutebrowser or any other non major browser it happens
2016-02-23 05:47:57	josm	fsociety: yeah I definitely don't get that
2016-02-23 05:48:09	greduan2	hinting, you mean the fonts? I haven't had that even in Webkit browsers
2016-02-23 05:48:15	greduan2	I had some fontconfig thingy iirc
2016-02-23 05:48:35	fsociety	yeah im wondering if its due to some font misconfiguration, but its default infinality under gentoo
2016-02-23 05:48:52	greduan2	https://gitlab.com/Greduan/dotfiles/raw/master/linux/fonts.conf
2016-02-23 05:49:04	greduan2	that goes in ~/.fonts.conf iirc
2016-02-23 05:49:12	greduan2	of course get rid of the default font definition
2016-02-23 05:50:02	greduan2	I used that to enable the smoothing without installing any special packages or anything like that on Arch and CRUX
2016-02-23 05:51:33	fsociety	brb just restarting X to see if this works

2016-02-23 11:06:43	+fyr	the -r option is the 'target' framerate you want to encode in
2016-02-23 11:06:52	+fyr	you never specify the source framerate
2016-02-23 11:07:15	+fyr	doing -framerate 60 then -r 30 seems to be giving me better results

2016-02-23 12:42:02	+fyr	you can use cat << EOF \n 'stuff to write to stdout' \nEOF
2016-02-23 12:42:05	@rocx	but people try "programming" in a shell.
2016-02-23 12:42:07	paul	insightful, no?
2016-02-23 12:42:16	paul	rocx: it's kinda want glues things together
2016-02-23 12:42:18	+fyr	instead of using echo mulitple times in a row
2016-02-23 12:42:19	paul	what*
2016-02-23 12:42:32	@rocx	paul: it's a glue. not a programming language to try the biggest trick shots with.
2016-02-23 12:43:08	paul	I mean, hell, I'll write up that script in C and port it to allll the *nix's and what not

2016-02-23 12:45:36	@rocx	a scripting environment can either be a DSL (domain-specific language) or a batch job execution tool (like a shell batch syntax).
2016-02-23 12:46:29	paul	right. Kinda didn't pay attention to the latter, they're all the same as long as it's turing complete IMO

2016-02-23 12:46:58	@rocx	in a sense, i'd classify a shell's batch syntax as a DSL of its own rather than general purpose.
2016-02-23 12:47:18	@rocx	its domain being in automation and execution of jobs.
2016-02-23 12:47:45	paul	mmm.

2016-02-23 21:57:06	mort_	were I to implement a linked list outside of uni, I wouldn't have made it only work with things extending Comparable, and wouldn't have a method to remove the smallest, as that should kind of be done outside of the list class
2016-02-23 21:57:47	mort_	also, for some reason, that Iterator just return an object, not something of type E

2016-02-23 22:15:52	mort_	though a linked list limited to things extending comparable is a bit more debatable

2016-02-23 23:23:08	sbrg	mort_: well, if you want to find things in your list you need to be able to compare them. sounds pretty logical to me.
2016-02-23 23:24:19	mort_	ye, but couldn't you have something outside of the list do the comparing?
2016-02-23 23:27:03	sbrg	I guess. I think there's a "comparator" class and a pattern that you use by implementing that for your type and then pass that
2016-02-23 23:27:08	sbrg	i think we did something like that anyway
2016-02-23 23:27:17	sbrg	but OOP is not my forté and definitely not in java so..

2016-02-23 23:55:24	mort_	well, Comparable is a class which many classes inherit from, letting you compare things regardless of their type
2016-02-23 23:55:26	mort_	isn't that hard
2016-02-23 23:55:36	@rocx	it just seems complex.
2016-02-23 23:55:45	mort_	not sure why it's not an interface
2016-02-23 23:56:14	@rocx	is an interface just a list of functions basically that each class can overload?
2016-02-23 23:56:19	@rocx	more or less?
2016-02-23 23:56:42	mort_	basically, ya
2016-02-23 23:57:00	mort_	and you can extend multiple interfaces, while you can only subclass one class
2016-02-23 23:57:05	@rocx	making sure i remember some things from the other java classes i had to take.
2016-02-23 23:59:52	mort_	what're you writing these days?

2016-02-24 08:41:04	+fyr	if I record it at the same time I have to split the video track and audio track tho :/
2016-02-24 08:41:57	+fyr	lossless file is good apart from the frameskips though
2016-02-24 08:42:09	+fyr	dunno if the audio is causing that or what

2016-02-24 08:48:48	+fyr	ah okay ffmpeg recommends just using the -framerate flag and not -r flag
2016-02-24 08:48:59	+fyr	that might be why it dropped frames
2016-02-24 08:50:25	fsociety	i tried encoding x265 4k on my i7 4770k the other day

2016-02-24 08:50:46	fsociety	yeah wasn't pretty
2016-02-24 08:51:30	+fyr	well the trick is to just record the lossless file then do the bulk of encoding later
2016-02-24 08:51:42	fsociety	i used to be in the scene doing tv encoding so its not like i'm some encoding noob either

2016-02-24 08:53:42	fsociety	first rule of scene, dont open source your tools. hahahaha

2016-02-24 08:53:56	@xero	smoothing filters and such

2016-02-24 09:08:13	fsociety	yeah i did scene stuff for a while, took too much of my time racing against other groups
2016-02-24 09:08:15	@xero	glad someonge got it
2016-02-24 09:08:17	fsociety	eventually i just left
2016-02-24 09:08:30	fsociety	the group is still going but a lot less activity
2016-02-24 09:08:32	@xero	gotta get that "scene cred"
2016-02-24 09:08:39	fsociety	their tags were -BWB and -RTA
2016-02-24 09:08:56	fsociety	its all epenis, and its full of very volatile people
2016-02-24 09:09:08	fsociety	98% windows users as well, which i found surprising
2016-02-24 09:15:00		[09:09]
2016-02-24 09:17:43	+fyr	huh okay recording audio and video at the same time caused the audio to skip
2016-02-24 09:17:58	+fyr	and it drops all the frames
2016-02-24 09:18:04	+fyr	in the time it skips
2016-02-24 09:18:14	+fyr	(i think..)
2016-02-24 09:19:36	fsociety	what are you trying to do fyr 
2016-02-24 09:19:52	+fyr	I've been writing some scripts for screencasting
2016-02-24 09:21:17	fsociety	using ffmpeg i'd imagine
2016-02-24 09:21:37	fsociety	i wonder if it makes any difference if you are using plain alsa backend or pulse
2016-02-24 09:23:51	+fyr	well pulse just uses alsa as it's backend sooooooo
2016-02-24 09:24:12	greduan	fuck yeah my refactor reduced the loading time by 80%
2016-02-24 09:24:19	greduan	i.e. it takes 80% of the time less, now
2016-02-24 09:24:29	fsociety	fyr: maybe so, but the way it interprets the audio is vastly different
2016-02-24 09:24:53	fsociety	tbh to get really good audio, you'd want to be using a low-latency configured kernel
2016-02-24 09:25:06	fsociety	less latency = less drop outs
2016-02-24 09:26:10	@xero	is that the rt-kernel?
2016-02-24 09:26:22	+fyr	fsociety, perhaps you're right but it only happens when I'm recording video at the same time.. :?
2016-02-24 09:26:27	@xero	i think that's what avlinux and kxstudio use iirc
2016-02-24 09:26:40	fsociety	xero: correct
2016-02-24 09:27:15	fsociety	fyr: the only thing i could suggest, is making when you are encoding its not hitting full 100% load.  i've had sound issues when it gest that far up
2016-02-24 09:27:30	fsociety	maybe try and adjust how much load the process can take and see if that helps
2016-02-24 09:27:40	fsociety	had multiple issues with kodi, audio and CPU load
2016-02-24 09:27:53	+fyr	well I am already using the ultrafast preset
2016-02-24 09:27:57	+fyr	:/
2016-02-24 09:28:05	fsociety	even so, change the affinity on the process
2016-02-24 09:28:09	@xero	kodi always runs like butter for me. even streaming 1080p over wifi
2016-02-24 09:28:16	fsociety	give it something like 75% of overall usage and see how it goes
2016-02-24 09:28:24	+fyr	using nice?
2016-02-24 09:28:28	fsociety	correct
2016-02-24 09:28:43	+fyr	higher number is less load right?
2016-02-24 09:29:14	fsociety	correct
2016-02-24 09:30:30	@xero	 interesting. i have never really read about rt was about until now.
2016-02-24 09:30:30		[09:30]
2016-02-24 09:30:42	@xero	it replaces most kernel spinlocks with mutexes that support priority inheritance
2016-02-24 09:30:49	@rocx	multimedia's a really screwy field.
2016-02-24 09:30:58	@rocx	a complex, patent-encumbered field.
2016-02-24 09:30:58	fsociety	i do a lot of audio prodution stuff in my spare time, latency is a bitch but improved dramatically in linux
2016-02-24 09:31:11	fsociety	actually thats one huge benefit of pulse, it makes jack easy to use also. but thats about it
2016-02-24 09:31:21	fsociety	too much lennart on my system is a bad thing ;)
2016-02-24 09:31:38	@rocx	iisn't any lennart too much lennart?
2016-02-24 09:32:18	fsociety	exactly
2016-02-24 09:32:43	fsociety	rocx: regarding patents, yeah especially when it comes to video compression patents
2016-02-24 09:32:56	fsociety	even vp8/vp9 and ogg are grey in some areas
2016-02-24 09:32:57	@rocx	can't wait for daala.
2016-02-24 09:33:11	fsociety	what's daala, new video codec?

2016-02-24 09:37:09	+fyr	hmm seems be alittle better when I run it with nice -n 19
2016-02-24 09:37:11	@rocx	xiph.
2016-02-24 09:37:12	@rocx	whatever.
2016-02-24 09:37:20	@rocx	it's not done yet though.
2016-02-24 09:37:30	fsociety	fyr: still having issues though
2016-02-24 09:37:31	+fyr	but the game itself is quite cpu heavy and it's still skipping slightly
2016-02-24 09:37:36	fsociety	ill check it out rocx 
2016-02-24 09:38:53	fsociety	have you tried using simple screen caster
2016-02-24 09:39:09	+fyr	no
2016-02-24 09:39:11	fsociety	thats the only screencasting software i've used on linux that does a really good job, even links into opengl calls
2016-02-24 09:39:18	+fyr	hmm
2016-02-24 09:39:21	+fyr	but ffmpeg
2016-02-24 09:39:24	+fyr	lossless
2016-02-24 09:39:37	fsociety	it uses ffmpeg, maybe you could rape the source code.. haha
2016-02-24 09:39:38	@xero	fyr wants to do things himself
2016-02-24 09:39:49	fsociety	not sure what it is written in though

2016-02-24 09:42:53	+fyr	okay again alittle bit improved
2016-02-24 09:42:59	fsociety	rocx: nice, they are putting patents on it to stop corps from infringing it, and will license it out freely 
2016-02-24 09:43:06	+fyr	it's weird though it's the audio that cuts out
2016-02-24 09:43:07	josm	evenin'
2016-02-24 09:43:14	@xero	o/ josm 
2016-02-24 09:43:15	+fyr	then ffmpeg drops frames
2016-02-24 09:43:17	fsociety	fyr: usually due to a buffer overrun
2016-02-24 09:43:29	+fyr	yeah I read that somewhere
2016-02-24 09:43:34	@xero	is you ram/cpu pegging?
2016-02-24 09:44:08	+fyr	I guess the cpu is
2016-02-24 09:44:21	+fyr	the game itself is running in wine which is probably what the problem is
2016-02-24 09:44:29	+fyr	it eats up a bunch of cpu too
2016-02-24 09:44:40	@fro	heh
2016-02-24 09:45:01	fsociety	ahh.. the game is probably pushing one core terribly
2016-02-24 09:45:15	fsociety	thats probably why you are getting the weird audio glitches
2016-02-24 09:45:24	fsociety	i don't think wine does multi-threading very well
2016-02-24 09:45:40	fsociety	you could try using wine-staging and see how that goes
2016-02-24 09:45:40		[09:45]
2016-02-24 09:45:45	+fyr	yeah I think the game is single core even on windows
2016-02-24 09:45:50	@rocx	wait, what voojoo jaem?
2016-02-24 09:46:09	fsociety	if thats the case, use nice on wine

2016-02-24 09:46:28	+fyr	hasn't made a difference sadly
2016-02-24 09:46:37	fsociety	do you have more than one soundcard in your pc at all
2016-02-24 09:46:55	fsociety	does your graphics card have an audiochip on it, most recent nvidia cards do
2016-02-24 09:46:58	@rocx	fsociety: the better question is how many of us use a soundcard as opposed to whatever integrated solution
2016-02-24 09:47:01	fsociety	you could route the audio from that
2016-02-24 09:47:12	@rocx	*whatever integrated chip deals with it.
2016-02-24 09:47:42	fsociety	i usually end up using the audio chip on one of my nvidia cards rather than the integrated audio. seperates the chain a little better
2016-02-24 09:48:01	+fyr	fsociety, yes but it's actually audio from my microphone.
2016-02-24 09:48:20	fsociety	so you are speaking over the top
2016-02-24 09:48:27	+fyr	indeeeeeeed
2016-02-24 09:48:50	+fyr	I haven't got loopback audio quite working yet :'(
2016-02-24 09:50:08	fsociety	is it a microphone that acts like its own soundcard?
2016-02-24 09:51:03	+fyr	nah just goes into the input mic
2016-02-24 09:52:31	fsociety	ahh.. i guess thats the other option by a cheapy headset mic or something that has a usb sound chip in it - only if you can't get past the issue
2016-02-24 09:53:45	+fyr	hmm

2016-02-24 10:36:12	mort_	is kind of sad, butu it seems to be the most sane way - I kind of want it to work for people on OS X or slightly old linux distros
2016-02-24 10:39:50	greduan	Python3
2016-02-24 10:40:14	greduan	Using Python2.7 is like using the first version of JS to make sure it works on old browsers
2016-02-24 10:40:46	mort_	nope
2016-02-24 10:41:21	mort_	using python 2.7 is like using the first version of JS because lots of peolpe actually use browsers which only support that, and a lot of systems come preinstalled with only browsers which are that old
2016-02-24 10:41:26	mort_	which would be pretty sane
2016-02-24 10:41:40	greduan	tell me, what version of Linux doesn't support Python3?
2016-02-24 10:41:43	@fro	lots of things still use python 2.7
2016-02-24 10:41:52	greduan	What version of OS X doesn't support Python3?
2016-02-24 10:41:56	greduan	fro: not saying that not
2016-02-24 10:42:08	greduan	but Python2 is frozen at 2.7 for eternity.
2016-02-24 10:42:14	mort_	debian jessie still comes with only python 2, OS X El Capitan still comes with only python 2
2016-02-24 10:42:22	greduan	mort_: can you install Python3?

2016-02-24 10:42:27	greduan	then you're not limited to Python2
2016-02-24 10:42:28	@fro	just saying
2016-02-24 10:42:56	mort_	using a language which comes with the user's computer will always be better than using one for which the user has to install an interpreter though
2016-02-24 10:43:46	greduan	nah
2016-02-24 10:43:54	mort_	is why you probably write ES5, or at least compile to ES5, instead of asking people to update to the very newest versions of chrome/FF and go to the browser's settings and enable experimental JS features
2016-02-24 10:44:04	greduan	oh I still use ES5
2016-02-24 10:44:08	greduan	cause I don't like ES6 lol
2016-02-24 10:44:14	greduan	it fucked up a lot of things iMO

2016-02-24 10:44:46	mort_	could definitely be another interesting discussion, but unrelated to this one
2016-02-24 10:44:53	greduan	which I understand is the reason that Python2 is still the standard, tons of devs dev in it cause they didn't like the changes Python3, but they've been like thie for fucking  years
2016-02-24 10:46:08	mort_	I don't like python 3 because writing code which supports python 2 and 3 at the same time is sane enough to be a good option, yet annoying
2016-02-24 10:47:21	greduan	IMO you support one or the other. Thankfully ES6 is backwards compatible so I don't actually have to write ES6
2016-02-24 10:47:21		[10:47]
2016-02-24 10:47:57	mort_	I would write python 2 if OS X let you do #!/usr/bin/env python2, but afaik, it only has python
2016-02-24 10:48:08	mort_	while #!/usr/bin/env python on my machine is python 3
