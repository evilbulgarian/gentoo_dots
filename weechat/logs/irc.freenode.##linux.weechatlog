2016-02-19 01:41:01	sigdk	lost_soul, that's what exactly I have. there is a watchdog script kicking in every 15 mins and checks if everything runs OK... but: 1) from time to time the guy who's nearby and sees it's being completely stuck all he can do is unplug the device. 2) since yesterday I'm doing experiments with "shutdown -r now" in a script. I've seen corrupted SD card after lets say 100 restarts... that shouldn't happen I guess

2016-02-19 02:12:27	oiaohm	sigdk: cpu and ram and other parts used in the pi are highly tolerant this is why it gets away with weak power protection.   Different SDcards have different spike tollerences.

I mean I've got these tmux sessions... they'd just look cooler if they were a bit more dynamic though... they're mostly just bits of code and man pages, and me slowly debugging stuff... obviously there's process stuff like htop, but apart from that, anything else...??

2016-02-19 02:30:19	darknight87	so, it depends on the client, and not the server
2016-02-19 02:30:54	Psi-Jack	Well as I said, most sane clients would refuse to accept it without the proper full chain, because they fully verify everything.
2016-02-19 02:30:54		[02:30]
2016-02-19 02:30:54	peetaur2	it's best if the browser has all the same settings, like the production dns name too, in case the app is stupid and redirects you to some absolute url, but having it on another url works most of the time

2016-02-19 03:16:01	aricz	Hi, I've installed a linux distro on a new partition.. how do I add that partition to the bootmanager?
2016-02-19 03:16:01		[03:16]
2016-02-19 03:16:09	Psi-Jack	So, what you might see from a kexec then, is, a failure to reap the zombie processes, and it would still be running, however the address space being remapped and available for use again which would eventually corrupt the process which may later cause "strange things to happen"(tm)(r) down the road, with kexec, versus just simply rebooting which guarantees full clean.

2016-02-19 04:00:01	soLucien	hello guys ! I've been trying to use systemd in order to run a boot script that interacts with NetworkManager. Unfortunately i have spent too much time with no success so i am trying another approach
2016-02-19 04:00:16	soLucien	is there some way that NetworkManager can be configured to run a scrip
2016-02-19 04:00:19	soLucien	when it initializes ?

2016-02-19 04:00:49	soLucien	it seems that NetworkManager's client nmclient is not available on boot, so it probably starts later

Anyone would try to help me find out what could possibly make VAST changes to my free disk space values (hopping between 150 G free, trickling to 100 G free in a few seconds, then back to 150 G and the cycle repeats) even though no process seen by iotop displays anything even remotely similar?

So.. where exactly is my theme folder or I can make it in ~/.local/share/themes and the new theme will appear in appearance menu?

I have a 23" monitor up on my rack in my office, and i want it to display facebook info, instagram, twitter... weather, time of day and so on... as a place to glance and see what is going on for the day. I found something called pygame http://goo.gl/9Ccdj2 but looking for something with a bit more info to display. I'm down to do this manually, or if

2016-02-19 16:39:21	timotheusb	ubuntu went slightly uphill but mostly downhill under cannocal i think
2016-02-19 16:39:42	storge	i thought canonical existed pretty much from the beginning?

2016-02-19 16:40:15	timotheusb	im pretty sure they only took over a few (like 8) years ago

2016-02-19 16:45:13	timotheusb	its pretty cool the way the system works everything is on an overlay so its pretty hard to break, and you just just reset it if need be and telnet into it
2016-02-19 16:45:31	storge	and keep it bugfixed/updated

2016-02-20 01:35:23	kamikazeattacks	mub, about the maximum amount
2016-02-20 01:35:25	diegoviola	how can I find my network chip main rev and sub rev, etc?

2016-02-20 01:35:56	jim	kamikazeattacks, with lvm you're not actually creating partitions, but a different entity called a logical volume... partitions are used with lvm to supply free space for these volumes

2016-02-20 09:59:29	tannercollin	the operating system GNU came first as an alternative to unix, but was missing a kernel. Then when Linus Torvalds applied a free license to Linux, it was used as the kernel for GNU and formed GNU/Linux. now you have a bunch of distros that take GNU/Linux, and throw a bunch of other software into the mix like a desktop environment, GUI apps, etc, etc and you end up with what people refer to as distros

2016-02-20 16:11:48	ilyanov	i have obtained a typescript file from a bash session.   It includes lots of escape-code colors in it.  Is there a program that can render these correctly (and possibly convert to a window/office  .doc file) ??
2016-02-20 16:11:50	shneh	they don't support linux at all. The client just runs on both windows and linux, and it works fine on windows.

2016-02-20 22:08:58	Jackneill	Tipping_Fedora, i have written kernel modules but this is for my father
2016-02-20 22:09:07	Tipping_Fedora	there is gentoo, but its only what you put there

2016-02-20 22:09:24	Tipping_Fedora	with that ram it might take a few days to install
2016-02-20 22:09:26	hexnewbie	Jackneill: If your father keeps it to one tab, the browser is 32 bit, and perhaps one or two other things are in order, 512 MB RAM may well be enough
2016-02-20 22:09:49	Tipping_Fedora	and with gentoo there wont be anything extra running taking ram

2016-02-20 22:32:01	Jackneill	jim, yeahm hence im looking for something  where i dont need to support, eg where the distro has an gui update bundled like linux mint's or ubuntu's synaptic so with 1 click everything is up to date

2016-02-20 23:29:07	phre4k	I recently read about an alternative site to twitter, I think based on GNUSocial, where people streamed to once twitter was down and/or sorted tweets differently. The article was about the newbies posting Kawaii pics because they're anime lovers and the resident users being offended because they're programmers. Ring any bells?

2016-02-20 23:57:37	Psi-Jack	TotalOblivion: Fedora.
2016-02-20 23:57:44	Psi-Jack	Too easy. :)
2016-02-20 23:57:44	timotheusbooth	dpends what you want TotalOblivion
2016-02-20 23:58:02	timotheusbooth	every man and his dog will have there own suggestions
2016-02-20 23:58:02	phre4k	I have a mysql dump of a whole DB, is there some easy GUI/TUI tool to split it into separate files?
2016-02-20 23:58:13	timotheusbooth	the dog will probably choose puppy...
2016-02-20 23:58:16	phre4k	I could just split at "USE" but that'd be hacky :D
2016-02-20 23:58:17	pingfloyd	TotalOblivion: use on that is a stable and dependable and get to know it well
2016-02-20 23:58:18	Psi-Jack	Well, I have 2 dogs, and both will suggest Fedora too. :)
2016-02-20 23:58:23	timotheusbooth	but it depends what you want
2016-02-20 23:58:35	kadiro	Psi-Jack,  yeah but the funny thing when i used a normal arch ( chrooting blah blah ) all works until i installed vdr and boom black screen, ask many times in arch channel without a response, and someday someone tell me about antergos that is a rolling release, i said i will just test it, and until now it work normally witch i can't understand why
2016-02-20 23:58:36	pingfloyd	otherwise you'll be distro hopping and chasing unicorns forevers
2016-02-20 23:58:37	TotalOblivion	timotheusbooth, learn linyx, be comfortable there, get as far away form windows logic as possible and learn to use terminal. but i'm a n00b so no gentoo for me XD

2016-02-21 02:18:37	dramforever	If you want execute, add the containing directory to your PATH. Appending a line like 'PATH=$PATH:/myfolder/' (without quotes) to your ~/.profile and re-login should do the job. (More coming)
2016-02-21 02:18:53	deadFox	G3nka1: you can edit the name as such /path/file_name/env sh
2016-02-21 02:19:00	jim	m451, one thing, if you have a bash script that is supposed to run as root, it makes sense to use the fully qualified paths for all the executables you use in it... in so doing, you (1) will be able to run it without worrying about PATH, and (2) won't have to worry about someone spoofing the executable... it could also solve the problem you have at hand

2016-02-21 04:38:00	gr8	hi. I want to re-attach an encrypted LUKS device. Context: I had a process running on an external USB disk and had to go. I suspended the process (Ctrl-z), tried to unmount (didn't work), then I pulled out the USB cable. Now when I try to re-mount it using the same name, cryptsetup tells me "device XY already exists". When I try to remove it with dmsetup, it says "Device or resource busy". My question is, now do I re-attach the disk so I can resume the process?

2016-02-21 09:31:47	hexnewbie	Backup should be a regular procedure, not just before you do something risky. Hardware fails more often than you think, and you do risky things when you don't realise it. :)

2016-02-21 09:32:12	jamesl	How to have a command output an incrementing file name? Ie if I run it once, it produces file001, then close and run the shell script again, file002 and so on. I can't use a for loop as the shell script is not running all the time, so I need to check for the highest number nad increment it by 1 automatically. What commands to do this?
2016-02-21 09:32:14	jim	probably fits on many dvds, not sure how many
2016-02-21 09:32:18	Loshki	gparted is one of the few GUIs that really is superior to the cli, and reduces formerly common mistakes like getting the arguments to commands backwards etc.

2016-02-21 12:14:37	jim	some people like old, it's what they're used to... others don't (I still use ifconfig with all its flaws because I'm not used to ip, while folks like psi-jack and FBI say it's old and it sucks... they have a point in saying that. Me, I have people use ifconfig if I'm helping, mostly because I can depend on it being there even though it's about 15 years old

2016-02-21 12:47:13	jdahm	I changed the passphrase of a PGP key in seahorse (GNOME application) and it seems to have correctly changed the passphrase because CLI pass (from zx2c4) seems to require the new passphrase to show passwords. But, when I encrypt a file on the command line with gpg -e -r "Password Storage Key" ~/file. To unlock the file with gpg ~/file.gpg it wants the old passphrase. Anyone know what might be going on?

2016-02-21 18:02:30	ayecee	this conversation is drifting rapidly towards full retard.
2016-02-21 18:02:31	MotoMac	ayecee this use to be a bug in ver 1.14.... hm
2016-02-21 18:02:34	rumpel	CoJaBo, who does understand security and never gets hacked?
2016-02-21 18:02:37	MotoMac	ayecee lol

2016-02-21 18:05:30	boingolov	CoJaBo: as a checksum, md5 is useful in some cases.  less expensive than a sha-2, good enough for a hash in most cases
2016-02-21 18:05:43	ayecee	MotoMac: i'd probably skip the - thing entirely and wget to a file
2016-02-21 18:05:55	rumpel	the md5 isn't the problem afaik
2016-02-21 18:06:09	boodllebat	ayecee: you did not answer my question i want to know what should i do i want output of a shell script in fixed intervel of time , what would be good , should i invoke a notifying signal from my shell script or i should create a notifying process which should run shell script and verify its output the notify to main process or i should use a seperate thread which should notify main by executing shell script and verifying its output

2016-02-21 18:12:11	ayecee	boodllebat: ok, inotify is definitely the better way to do that. you can't guarantee that the writes will be atomic, and you don't want to end up reading incomplete data.
2016-02-21 18:12:15	boingolov	are there any other distros running usl?

2016-02-21 18:12:46	boodllebat	ayecee: so inotify can get content of shell-file bye executing it ?
2016-02-21 18:13:24	ayecee	boodllebat: no, inotify can tell you that a shell file has finished writing to a file and closed it.

2016-02-21 18:15:31	DicePower	When I plug the external hard drive in when in Windows, I get a message "Do you want to scan and fix [drive name]"?  It says there might be a problem with some files on this device or disk.  This can happen if you remove the device or disc before all files have been written to it.  I assume this is just because Windows doesn't know how to read the stuff that was generated by the other program?
2016-02-21 18:15:41	boodllebat	ayecee: :D you got that

2016-02-21 20:41:14	hexnewbie	OK, that's weird. I am replacing both of my RAID drives. The root RAID gave mismatch_cnt on a repair ran right after the rebuild (oops I guess?) None of the other RAIDs do. That leaves me with many interesting choices for the future.

2016-02-21 20:54:15	pingfloyd	say that happened to debian.  Users that check their copies, would see right away there is concern.

2016-02-21 20:54:17	Someguy123	and even with GPG, the attacker can modify the GPG instructions, especially if you're new and haven't had the previously good key trusted in your client

2016-02-21 20:56:36	hexnewbie	You can verify the ISO outside of a hash after you verify the GPG signature of the hash or the ISO. The trouble is - who gets ISOs other than new users? If I know the GPG code of Debian, I don't download ISOs of Debian, because I already have it installed, and I just use debootstrap to install new ones.

2016-02-22 11:14:24	Loshki	diegoviola: be realistic, it's a intermittent bug, possibly a race condition. Those aren't the easiest to debug. And you've stubbornly refused to do to the easy, cheap workaround. And so far, no else has reported experiencing it. But you want some device driver developer to fix it for you, for free, right now.
2016-02-22 11:14:25	diegoviola	Cymage: that's an ugly hack

2016-02-22 15:20:32	ackpacket	I installed a printer a while ago, and after resetting the router I think the printer changed IP and now my system can't find it.  I'd like to solve this by moving my printer back to the IP my system is expecting it to be at, and reserving it there forever, but first I need to know: What IP is my system looking for the printer on?  Near as I can tell, there is a local CUPS running, apps talk to CUPS, and CUPS talks to the printer

2016-02-23 02:13:54	rkeene	But, more the point -- dnsmasq isn't authortiatve, it simply holds the authoritative configuration -- most people just set a static IP consecutively "near" the gateway IP address for that subnet

2016-02-23 02:14:56	rkeene	jim, Right, but the DHCPD has to be up and running on an interface with an IP address before it can do that
2016-02-23 02:14:59	jim	right, you can just configure the interface static too
2016-02-23 02:15:05	soLucien	then when dnsmasq starts, it reads the IP address of eth1 and starts the DHCP beacon on it
2016-02-23 02:15:07	rkeene	(Since DHCP is an IP-based protocol)

2016-02-23 02:15:35	arlion	blind: thank you, I used sed -i 's_/ubuntu/_/mirrors/ubuntu-trusty/mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/_g' /etc/apt/sources.list and was a lot easier to read and much easier to write.
2016-02-23 02:15:41	Blendphys	Hi. I redirect windows from an old SUN box to an Ubuntu 14.04 box, via "setenv DISPLAY IPaddress". The colors are strange and some text cannot be seen because all is black. How to change colors?
2016-02-23 02:15:50	Tentacled	I... seem to have found the culprit after all, using some lsof digging. My httpd's logfile grew to 50 GB, and the filesystem apparently tried to reserve twice as much with every log write. I truncated it (screw statistics) and no more df fluctuations!

2016-02-23 02:41:50	TotalOblivion	triceratux, from what i've read gnome is simplicity itself. though so much that it kidna gets non-functinal after some point. and from what i've seen kde is very windows like (and read that due to very customizability hight chances for crushing). hence me checking enlightnemtn. i think xfce and lxde ned a proper investigation as well at some point on my side.

2016-02-23 04:51:28	Psi-Jack	1194 has always been the default, though with sslh, a little package-inspecting wrapper daemon, you can in fact combine OpenVPN, SSH, and HTTPS all on one port 443 with the sslh daemon.

2016-02-23 04:54:34	Psi-Jack	1194 is the default port OpenVPN uses unless specifically configured to use something else. For tcp and udp traffic.
2016-02-23 04:54:55	rattking	people send all sorts of stuff over 443 because they worry about firewalls blocking other ports.

2016-02-23 12:32:47	jim	you should make sure you're not using this old technology called a telnetd server... also, you should make sure you don't need plain ftp, and get rid of your ftpd server...

2016-02-23 21:39:58	Pantsu	you could argue that having a process that multiple users can access having rwx access to yout $HOME is a security fail
2016-02-23 21:40:08	Pantsu	JyZyXEL: you can set default permissions with acl

2016-02-23 22:17:10	Pantsu	it is possible to use sip securely without vpn too though
2016-02-23 22:17:38	hiya	peetaur2, Pantsu I just asking all this because I host an OVPN server for community and I help a lot of people to host their own server for their own friends and fam, so people do exist who try to keep no logs possible, sure my provider's ISP might be logging as per the law but it is really good for people to an extend
2016-02-23 22:17:47	Pantsu	peetaur2: well it needs the ip to set up the p2p comm

2016-02-23 22:18:07	peetaur2	I found that most things do it wrong, and once you encrypt it, nf_conntrack and such can't work around the stupid broken protocol (private ips in the request are actually used, and you have to nat them or it won't work) ... so I'd never put the effort into making sip work as is

2016-02-23 22:19:49	hiya	Pantsu, peetaur2 why do providers like Mullvad claim to make you anonymous? some even make you 100% anonymoous lol Also don't they already know about it?

2016-02-23 22:37:34	peetaur2	Stameni: most likely yes... you could even move it to a virtual machine, or totally different hardware, and it will likely work fine.

2016-02-23 22:38:18	peetaur2	one example of failure is bare metal centos moving to a kvm virtual machine with virtio disks... the initramfs doesn't have the virtio driver, so it fails. So you can either add it first for when you use mkinitrd next, or you boot ide first and fix, then reboot with virtio.

2016-02-23 22:41:33	Stameni	peetaur2: except that I don't need to do anything special after upgrading CPU unit
2016-02-23 22:41:36	Walex	peetaur2: the discussion started because some "miguided souls" (euphemism alert!) want to remove the '/' directories and leave only '/usr'.
2016-02-23 22:41:45	peetaur2	Stameni: when configuring a custom kernel (or the distro configuring it), there are options like that.... y means yes, which means the kernel has the driver built in, so grub loads it once it loads the kernel. But with =m, it is a separate file on the disk, so for grub to use it, it has to load it from an archive file called the "init ram fs" or "init ram disk", and so you have to rebuild those with the module if they are not built in.
2016-02-23 22:41:56	Walex	peetaur2: my argument was that they should remove GRUB and initramfs and use '/' instead
2016-02-23 22:42:00	Qwertie	Is there any way to use a wildcard in bash and have it pick files numerically? so I would get 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf instead of 100.pdf 11.pdf 139.pdf?
2016-02-23 22:42:06	peetaur2	Stameni: and I was saying that in Ubuntu and some other distros, they set =y, but in centos, it's =m
2016-02-23 22:42:09	Walex	peetaur2: my argument was that they should remove GRUB and /boot and initramfs and use '/' instead

2016-02-23 23:03:16	Pantsu	also how old is that kernel?

It seems to only be keeping backups for some months. Do I need to make my default longer so that a month of data is available for the monthly backup?

2016-02-24 07:36:56	Psi-Jack	MacWinner: There are reasons, mostly mild performance increases. noatime forces the mount to not alter the filesystem everytime a file is accessed, that is including read, statted, etc. The downfall is, anything looking at that atime inode information will get inaccurate information obviously.

2016-02-24 07:40:48	Psi-Jack	Anything that needs to know when a file has been read since it was last modified, which is why relatime is a better mount option to use, because relatime only updates atime when atime is older than mtime or ctime.

2016-02-24 08:19:32	CrazyH	I'm currently Googling, reading and trying to think of a good way to make postfix encrypt all in coming mail. It is sent to the server in plain text, but as soon as it hits the server I'd like to encrypt it and store in the mailbox in it's encrypted form. Is there an easy way to do that? I'm hoping to find a way to have postfix pipe incoming through a command or script. That would solve it.

2016-02-24 08:43:57	Alina-malina	Psi-Jack, i tried to format from linux, but it didnt pass, so i dont understand what is going on with this flash drive, when i plug it in it shows 2 partitions, 1) full not possible format/delete anything and 2) normal partition, so i want to just remove that full one and make this flash drive 1 normal partition
2016-02-24 08:44:17	Psi-Jack	Alina-malina: Did you remove all the partitions?

2016-02-24 09:37:02	peetaur	Bromo: if it's the kind of machine where you get annoyed if you broke it and have to look up docs to fix it, maybe not arch. If it's really a hobby, then arch sounds fine.

2016-02-24 10:30:43	dieg0_	So here is the problem. When I connect my phone to the usb, it is not found, but through my windows virtual machine is found. however when i try to do stuff with it, i get an error that the usb is used by the host (even though ive disconnected it through vmware) and gives me somethind about cdc_acm. From what I understood, the solution would be using qemu kvm i can block the usb port from the host OS and use it only for the virtual machine. Howeve
2016-02-24 10:30:44	dieg0_	r idk how. could anyone help please?

2016-02-24 11:33:47	mrrhq	I can secure NFS though hopefully with encryption, so maybe I don't need SSh tunneling after all.

2016-02-24 11:34:14	outofsorts	mrrhq: If your using ssh, then look at sshfs as a way to remote mount a filesystem.

2016-02-24 12:14:35	reisio	yeah, honestly don't need more than a window up at once most of the time
2016-02-24 12:14:42	reisio	and when I do, usually just two or three is enough
2016-02-24 12:14:56	reisio	workspaces are a pretty great solution most of the time, and even then not so frequently required

2016-02-24 12:18:14	reisio	I mean it's nice to have a monitor dedicated to a single app you rarely but nevertheless regularly refer to
2016-02-24 12:18:18	reisio	but pretty unnecessary, too, IMO

2016-02-24 12:18:48	reisio	the best argument I've heard for multiple monitors is that humans weren't designed to stare at a fixed point all day, and simply giving your body an excuse to move at all is better than not
2016-02-24 12:19:00	reisio	but that's soft of a half measure :p
2016-02-24 12:19:13	pingfloyd	I pretty much run all my windows maximized, except when I need a reference window and then it's pretty much just 2 windows at once which basic tiling of xfce works nice for.

2016-02-24 12:19:33	mrrhq	reisio: cwm is part of OpenBSD. On Debian, you run the executable as openbsd-cwm.
2016-02-24 12:19:35	reisio	although it seems Xfce is more and more relying on dconf (I didn't bring this up here yet, did I?)
2016-02-24 12:19:42	reisio	which is a non starter for me
2016-02-24 12:19:50	mrrhq	Probably is in Arch as well.
2016-02-24 12:19:51	reisio	probably have to replace Xfce
2016-02-24 12:20:03	reisio	mrrhq: yeah, but that's not a homepage
2016-02-24 12:20:09	pingfloyd	I hope they don't drastically change xfce down the road, it's almost perfect now
2016-02-24 12:20:19	reisio	I think they already did, it just hasn't trickled down yet
2016-02-24 12:20:29	reisio	I noticed last week that it seems to depend heavily on dconf now

2016-02-24 12:22:59	pingfloyd	that's what I like about xfce, it keeps it basic with just features I really care about.
2016-02-24 12:23:24	reisio	gconf/dconf is where I have drawn the line, for a decade
2016-02-24 12:23:28	mrrhq	I also like XFCE, but since I'm also trying to migrate from X11 to Wayland altogether, a lightweight WM works best for me until something comes over to Wayland.
2016-02-24 12:23:29	reisio	I will not use that software
2016-02-24 12:23:38	reisio	if Xfce deps on it, I doubt I'll use Xfce
2016-02-24 12:23:46	mrrhq	I still think XWayland compatability is not good enough, especially wiht my Web browser.
2016-02-24 12:23:46	soLucien	what could i do in order to schedule something after a reboot ?
2016-02-24 12:23:50	reisio	yeah
2016-02-24 12:23:57	pingfloyd	what worries me, if they're going to integrate dconf, is that it will open the door for feature creep

2016-02-24 12:24:07	reisio	I think I'll give lxde a brief audit, but I'll probably end up making my own makeshift xfce/lxde workalike out of spare parts :/ :p
2016-02-24 12:24:17	reisio	pingfloyd: yeah, I mean it is feature creep
2016-02-24 12:24:21	soLucien	no system-D , i spent 2 days making a simple piece of bash , and i ended up using sleep and grep anyways

2016-02-24 12:24:26	soLucien	so it is totally unreliable
2016-02-24 12:24:36	pingfloyd	I guess if it comes to do that, hopefully someone will start a fork that stays with traditional xfce

2016-02-24 12:28:34	reisio	I think Debian splits upstream packages into "lib" and "nonlib", so you probably do have it
2016-02-24 12:29:01	reisio	it seems GTK+-3 apps use dconf for y'know, prefs
2016-02-24 12:29:02	mrrhq	Yeah, Debian prefers dynamically linked libraries over statically compiled.
2016-02-24 12:29:08	mrrhq	So that's pretty cool.

2016-02-24 12:30:50	triceratux	reisio: canonical wrote a dconf editor that is becoming pretty common in the distros. its true in xfce mousepad moved its settings to dconf. i dont notice cause i have my own compiled mousepad. the rest of xfce is still config files
2016-02-24 12:31:00	mrrhq	gconf is easier to avoid (in general) if you don't use Gnome apps.
2016-02-24 12:31:02	triceratux	i also draw the line at dconf/gconf
2016-02-24 12:31:07	pingfloyd	that's a problem, but I'd rather they address it without biting the bullet

2016-02-24 14:21:24	mrrhq	The big problem with sigkill, and maybe sigterm does this too, is that, unless you trap the signal, any parent processes will be left running, and if it's still doing something or writing to disk, that can cause issues like zombie processes or otherwise unkillable. I guess it's just cleaner.

2016-02-24 14:30:51	LambdaComplex	plorph: well, let's start by figuring out what you mean by "windows mbr"
2016-02-24 14:31:09	LambdaComplex	plorph: do you mean the windows boot manager that gets put in the mbr by windows when you install it?
2016-02-24 14:31:10	noobstrap	Hi. Quick question. Why do some packages like weechat put curses after the program name, like weechat-curses?
2016-02-24 14:31:37	mrrhq	I wonder if plorph is trying to dual-boot.
2016-02-24 14:31:47	plorph	LambdaComplex: well perhaps that terminoligy doesn't make sense. I just mean restoring 1 partition with windows and get rid of grub
2016-02-24 14:31:48	LambdaComplex	noobstrap: well, first, it's the developer of your distribution that names packages

2016-02-24 18:41:59	survietamine	CrazyH: more than that
2016-02-24 18:42:14	SporkWitch	CrazyH: everything you've proposed has the same requirements as PGP itself, you're just talking about automating it.  Set your mail client to automatically encrypt everything if it has a public key for the recipient; it's supported in basically every PGP-enabled mail client (or if not the client itself, then the plugin the client uses)

2016-02-24 19:00:48	jim	SporkWitch, do you realize I hate doing that? you're all smart and you all need to take a breath (you should do so volintarily

2016-02-24 19:00:53	ayecee	SporkWitch: it's a solution to a problem no one asked.
2016-02-24 19:00:58	mrrhq	ayecee: Well, depends. You always have to decrypt a file to read it.

2016-02-24 19:01:18	mrrhq	But the decrypted file should stay in RAM, hopefully.

2016-02-24 19:01:55	ayecee	mrrhq: CrazyH had an unusual solution of having a separate machine do the decryption. i don't know how useful that is in practice, but it's novel at least.
2016-02-24 19:02:04	mrrhq	At least people don't have to decrypt files to know what it is, because hashes, checksums and signatures.

2016-02-24 19:02:56	SporkWitch	mrrhq: not on the server, which was the thing he was concerned about.  the solution CrazyH was hypothesizing would automatically encrypt things using public keys based on recipients.  So,, ignoring the fact that it is unencrypted on arrival pending encryption and storage for delivery to the user, you still need the recipient's public key.
2016-02-24 19:03:02	mrrhq	ayecee: Maybe it was what he could only do so far.
2016-02-24 19:03:05	ayecee	pingfloyd: nah, i do non-sequiturs on alternate days.
2016-02-24 19:03:39	kadiro	O_o
2016-02-24 19:03:41	SporkWitch	mrrhq: it complicates it unnecessarily, doesn't actually offer any security (since it's unencrypted during transit and in memory on arrival, and you have to assume that the server isn't compromised to prevent using the right public key for local storage)

2016-02-24 19:03:52	mrrhq	Well it's not like you have to give identifying information on your public key.

2016-02-24 19:04:01	mrrhq	You can make an anonymous public key.
2016-02-24 19:04:16	SporkWitch	mrrhq: the actual solution is to just use PGP and tell your mates to as well, just like back in the 90's.  This way the only issues are on the clients, which are the issues you can never perfectly eliminate.
2016-02-24 19:04:18	mrrhq	But yeah, nobody likes to make a whole bunch of key pairs.
