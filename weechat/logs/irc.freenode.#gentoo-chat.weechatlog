2016-01-21 00:27:53	+zlg	wpa_supplicant --help has a bit more information
2016-01-21 00:28:32	+zlg	If you're using a net.* script, then I'm somewhat confused since wpa_supplicant should be handling your net for you.

2016-01-21 00:46:18	+wiktor_b	that's because you forgot to run `lilo` after updating kernel

2016-01-21 01:26:17	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: DP 1.3 maxes out at 32.4gbps (25.92 if you remove digital overhead)
2016-01-21 01:26:20	catpiggest	SpaceToast, he meant that 1080p60 uncompressed doesnt fit in 1gbps. needs about 3gbit
2016-01-21 01:26:27	SpaceToast	well, I'd imagine so
2016-01-21 01:26:32	SpaceToast	but why would you use hdmi for that?
2016-01-21 01:26:33	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Yah all those solutions work if you're close to your gear.
2016-01-21 01:26:58	+FrostFeline	What do news studios do with their oodles of video feeds that they have to transmit across their giant building?
2016-01-21 01:27:06	+FrostFeline	Compress it all and use ethernet?
2016-01-21 01:27:18	SpaceToast	probably sneakernet :^)
2016-01-21 01:27:19	catpiggest	FrostFeline, i'm sure there are occasionally situations where it makes sense to spend 1200$ on a 60m monitor cable. i just dont think they're very common ;)
2016-01-21 01:27:31	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Sure
2016-01-21 01:27:48	+UberPinguin	iamben: http://sabhaile.uberpinguin.com/emerge_err.txt   not entirely sure what I'm missing here. I think my installed ncurses should satisfy all the deps listed, but it's still trying to pull in an '-r4' which of course is <= '-r101'
2016-01-21 01:27:54	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I was just curious about how $1000+ networking equipment would ever be useful
2016-01-21 01:27:58	catpiggest	ofc the technology is new (thunderbolt was only introduced 5 years ago, but with USB3 it seems to be a stillbirth)
2016-01-21 01:28:22	+iamben	UberPinguin: you were on unstable ncurses and now it wants to downgrade to stable, any idea why?
2016-01-21 01:28:25	+FrostFeline	USB-C is supposed to be able to carry thunderbolt on the macbook
2016-01-21 01:28:41	+UberPinguin	iamben: no
2016-01-21 01:28:45	+mvaenskae	hm, yubico needs to update their yubikeys
2016-01-21 01:28:45	+UberPinguin	no changes in keywords
2016-01-21 01:28:46	+FrostFeline	Seems tb will just get priced out by "good enough" usb 3.1
2016-01-21 01:28:52	+iamben	UberPinguin: are you on full stable, supposedly?
2016-01-21 01:28:52	catpiggest	not full current thunderbird as usb3.1 only does ~10gbit
2016-01-21 01:28:56	catpiggest	yep
2016-01-21 01:29:02	stintel	mvaenskae: which ones ?
2016-01-21 01:29:10	catpiggest	its a good idea in theory, but its not its time yet
2016-01-21 01:29:15	+mvaenskae	stintel: i want a yubikey4 with nfc support
2016-01-21 01:29:24	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Sneakernet? :P
2016-01-21 01:29:38	+UberPinguin	iamben: I should be on full ~, ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="amd64 ~amd64" in make.conf
2016-01-21 01:29:42	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: So 3000 floppies per second using interns?
2016-01-21 01:29:51	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: you take a small PC with a massive SSD with you to record, then you take out the massive SSD and plug it in somewhere else
2016-01-21 01:30:03	+UberPinguin	iamben: the thing is, at least according to eix, there is no 5.9-r4 in the tree
2016-01-21 01:30:03	SpaceToast	more like one M.2 or PCIe 4TB SSD
2016-01-21 01:30:10	+UberPinguin	so I'm not sure why portage has it in the depgraph
2016-01-21 01:30:12	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Yeah, that's not going to help with live video ;)
2016-01-21 01:30:14	catpiggest	SpaceToast, if thats the only alternative to the 1200$ cable, the cable is cheaper ;)
2016-01-21 01:30:32	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: I did ask about news studios, specifically
2016-01-21 01:30:33	+iamben	UberPinguin: uh yes there
2016-01-21 01:30:35	+iamben	is
2016-01-21 01:30:45	stintel	mvaenskae: I see. I only have 2 U2F from the github offer
2016-01-21 01:30:50	+UberPinguin	I see it on disk, for some reason eix isn't showing it. doing an eix-update now.
2016-01-21 01:30:57	+FrostFeline	I'm curious to what hardware they use to transmit their video all over their large studio buildings (and mix it in real time)
2016-01-21 01:31:06	catpiggest	oh, ethernet one would imagine
2016-01-21 01:31:07	+UberPinguin	but that still doesn't answer the blocker issue
2016-01-21 01:31:14	+mvaenskae	stintel: i would like to use the yubikey as a all-in-one solution preferably
2016-01-21 01:31:16	+iamben	UberPinguin: did you get part of the way through a full upgrade, and it failed, so that some of your pkgs are built for ncurses-5 and some are build for ncurses-6?
2016-01-21 01:31:26	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Compressed or uncompressed?
2016-01-21 01:31:28	+UberPinguin	iamben: not afaik
2016-01-21 01:31:41	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: You lose detail when you compress video, naturally.
2016-01-21 01:31:44	+UberPinguin	5.9-r4 is ~amd64
2016-01-21 01:31:44	catpiggest	FrostFeline, varies, i would imagine.
2016-01-21 01:31:54	catpiggest	there is lossless compression, too, they might be using that
2016-01-21 01:31:57	+mvaenskae	stintel: i am using right now a gpg smartcard and that is quite nice knowing noone can access my keys without some advanced RE of the physical card
2016-01-21 01:32:13	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Which brings to mind, why doesn't everything use lossless compression?
2016-01-21 01:32:19	tomboy64	is someone else here using irssi 0.8.17?
2016-01-21 01:32:24	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: At the very least you could get by with cheaper hdmi cables
2016-01-21 01:32:41	+mvaenskae	tomboy64: i am
2016-01-21 01:32:50	tomboy64	mvaenskae: could you ping me please?
2016-01-21 01:32:54	catpiggest	FrostFeline, the data rate saving apparently isnt justified by the increased cost of making monitors and graphics units
2016-01-21 01:32:58	+FrostFeline	We already have ubiquitous hardware h264 support?
2016-01-21 01:32:59	+mvaenskae	erm, how would i do that?
2016-01-21 01:33:02	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: how wouldn't that help with live video?
2016-01-21 01:33:06	catpiggest	or else hdmi/dvi/dp made a bad call
2016-01-21 01:33:10	SpaceToast	you capture it, uncompressed, and then later move it for editing
2016-01-21 01:33:11	tomboy64	mvaenskae: ctcp tomboy64 ping
2016-01-21 01:33:13	+iamben	UberPinguin: you have ncurses:5 in world?
2016-01-21 01:33:16	tomboy64	mvaenskae: /ctcp tomboy64 ping
2016-01-21 01:33:33	catpiggest	Ping reply from tomboy64: ? second(s)
2016-01-21 01:33:37	tomboy64	yeah
2016-01-21 01:33:40	+mvaenskae	just pinged you
2016-01-21 01:33:42	tomboy64	looks like a bug in irssi
2016-01-21 01:33:50	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: It's not "live" any more if you have to spend a couple minutes lugging it across the studio
2016-01-21 01:33:55	tomboy64	works fine with weechat and irccloud
2016-01-21 01:33:58	stintel	Irssi 0.8.17 (20141011) - http://irssi.org/
2016-01-21 01:34:10	stintel	(/sv)
2016-01-21 01:34:13	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: sure it is. It's live when you capture it. NO one in their right mind does EDITING as it's being captured.
2016-01-21 01:34:17	tomboy64	and i can ping irssi clients just fine. just irssi misinterpretes weechat responses
2016-01-21 01:34:18	+UberPinguin	iamben: ncurse-6.0 is in :5, technically :5/6
2016-01-21 01:34:21	SpaceToast	Editing takes HOURS per mere MINUTES of video
2016-01-21 01:34:42	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Don't news stations operate on a 30 second delay?
2016-01-21 01:34:44	+iamben	UberPinguin: there is a :0 and :5 slot for compat reasons, why do you have ncurses in world at all though?
2016-01-21 01:34:46	tomboy64	weird
2016-01-21 01:34:48	catpiggest	FrostFeline, asked my mate, maybe he happens to know
2016-01-21 01:35:03	Smiley	errr
2016-01-21 01:35:09	stintel	20|15:35:13 [Freenode] CTCP PING reply from tomboy64: 0.562 seconds
2016-01-21 01:35:11	Smiley	James Cameron made that system that 'live' renders scenes
2016-01-21 01:35:16	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: news stations typically just don't edit
2016-01-21 01:35:17	+UberPinguin	iamben: idk, probably because I emerged it. But unmerging it does not help.
2016-01-21 01:35:22	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Right, that's editing, not mixing live ;)
2016-01-21 01:35:26	+UberPinguin	I unmerged all ncurse, and still had the blocker
2016-01-21 01:35:28	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Ah
2016-01-21 01:35:34	SpaceToast	mixing live isn't a problem with what I described
2016-01-21 01:35:58	tomboy64	hmm
2016-01-21 01:36:06	+iamben	UberPinguin: you're going to hurt yourself if you unmerge it, just use --ignore-build-slot-operator-deps=y until your upgrade & preserve-rebuild are done
2016-01-21 01:36:06	+FrostFeline	Are we still taking about carrying around SSDs?
2016-01-21 01:36:27	tomboy64	gb: weechat 1.4
2016-01-21 01:36:31	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: you either missed my point entirely or exagerating
2016-01-21 01:36:40	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: I'm confused.
2016-01-21 01:36:47	catpiggest	FrostFeline, tbh i would *guess* that the camera does a high quality compression itself. but as noted, thats a pure guess
2016-01-21 01:36:53	stintel	tomboy64: I could ping you fine from irssi 0.8.17 btw
2016-01-21 01:37:00	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: my point is - mixing and recording is done unto an SSD through a mixer. ONCE IT IS TIME TO EDIT, you take it out and take it to your DVW and DAW, which are elsewhere
2016-01-21 01:37:20	tomboy64	stintel: yes, i saw that. doesn't work from mvaenskae, catpiggest and Smiley .
2016-01-21 01:37:26	Smiley	weird
2016-01-21 01:37:31	Smiley	might be me blockign the reply or something tho
2016-01-21 01:37:39	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: If you're going to be spending $3000 on  camera(s) then they better support hardware compression/RAW/lossless! :O
2016-01-21 01:37:49	+mvaenskae	could very well be that our clients block replies
2016-01-21 01:38:00	+mvaenskae	i got empty replies back twice
2016-01-21 01:38:01	catpiggest	FrostFeline, i think those cameras cost a lot more ^^. but thats also a pure guess
2016-01-21 01:38:03	tomboy64	mvaenskae: which would be kinda stupid ;)
2016-01-21 01:38:13	tomboy64	and catpiggest is using hexchat
2016-01-21 01:38:25	catpiggest	Ping reply from mvaenskae: ? second(s)
2016-01-21 01:38:28	catpiggest	could be my client it seems
2016-01-21 01:38:33	catpiggest	or my router
2016-01-21 01:38:42	tomboy64	doubtful it's the router
2016-01-21 01:38:45	stintel	tomboy64: are you perhaps connected via IPv6 ?
2016-01-21 01:38:57	tomboy64	stintel: doubtful
2016-01-21 01:38:57	catpiggest	tomboy64, doesnt CTCP require direct connectivity?
2016-01-21 01:39:09	catpiggest	which i dont get since my router NATs
2016-01-21 01:39:20	*	mvaenskae is behind a double router
2016-01-21 01:39:29	stintel	this box has a public IP :)
2016-01-21 01:39:31	catpiggest	mvaenskae, double NAT?
2016-01-21 01:39:40	stintel	mvaenskae: everything is behind a few routers ;P
2016-01-21 01:39:44	stintel	that's how the internet works ;)
2016-01-21 01:39:45	*	SpaceToast is behind hopes and dreams
2016-01-21 01:39:47	tomboy64	catpiggest: no, i'm with ipv4
2016-01-21 01:39:48	+mvaenskae	i am at least behind 2
2016-01-21 01:39:56	*	Smiley is behind NAT
2016-01-21 01:40:00	Smiley	mvaenskae: you mean you're behind double NAT?
2016-01-21 01:40:14	catpiggest	everyone is behind 20 routers. thats not a problem. its only a problem if there's more than 1 NAT involved
2016-01-21 01:40:17	+FrostFeline	anyway, cool talk :D
2016-01-21 01:40:26	*	FrostFeline jellies SpaceToast :>
2016-01-21 01:40:31	Smiley	catpiggest: isn't even nessicarrly a problem then, just requires more config
2016-01-21 01:40:31	*	tomboy64 shrugs
2016-01-21 01:40:31	catpiggest	if you have double nat you should be smacked ;)
2016-01-21 01:40:35	Smiley	and gets fugly.
2016-01-21 01:40:41	catpiggest	Smiley, yep
2016-01-21 01:40:47	 > 	jaake (~h4ckm3@DHCP-129-59-122-160.n1.vanderbilt.edu) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-01-21 01:40:48	+mvaenskae	i could very well be, i connect via wireless to the main internet router (a performing wireless card for desktops that is open is more expensive than an archer c7v2)
2016-01-21 01:40:51	catpiggest	and tends to be insane ;)
2016-01-21 01:41:01	tomboy64	nat's only a problem with direct connections. eg ctcp. still, a ctcp reply is received.
2016-01-21 01:41:02	+mvaenskae	so now i also have my local lan :)
2016-01-21 01:41:18	+mvaenskae	inside a "local lan"
2016-01-21 01:41:25	+UberPinguin	iamben: it seems ncurses:0/5 blocks ncurses:5/5, which I thought slots were supposed to avoid?
2016-01-21 01:41:42	Smiley	UberPinguin: you found kitty then :)
2016-01-21 01:41:45	catpiggest	if people are having network problems and they use double nat there tends to be a correlation between the two. ofc it is possible to set up 100 layers of NAT correctly, it's just rare
2016-01-21 01:42:07	+iamben	UberPinguin: slots were abused a bit for this ncurses case
2016-01-21 01:42:26	+UberPinguin	I mean, the blocker message is "<sys-lib/ncurses-6.0 blocks sys-lib/ncurses-5.9-r101", but :0/5 is all 5.9-r3/4/5
2016-01-21 01:42:32	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: So... hooking up 100 soho routers would be a ... bad idea, right? :)
2016-01-21 01:42:42	catpiggest	people who can set up such insanity correctly arent usually employed to network private homes or small offices, and you dont usually use NAT except in such places
2016-01-21 01:42:45	+UberPinguin	Smiley: yep :)
2016-01-21 01:42:59	Smiley	UberPinguin: any idea where he was hiding out? Did he just reappear one day?
2016-01-21 01:43:12	+UberPinguin	Smiley: he was spending at least some of the time under the back deck
2016-01-21 01:43:20	Smiley	lol
2016-01-21 01:43:23	Smiley	not far then :)
2016-01-21 01:43:27	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: On a more serious note, what's the correct way to set up 100 layers of NAT besides... dont?
2016-01-21 01:43:34	+iamben	UberPinguin: anything which claims to need :0/5 is outdated & needs rebuild
2016-01-21 01:43:42	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Aren't things like iptables MASQ mature?
2016-01-21 01:43:46	catpiggest	FrostFeline, well, depends on what exactly you need... but that setup is gonna be sensitive
2016-01-21 01:43:46	+UberPinguin	iamben: k
2016-01-21 01:44:00	 - 	fling_ is now known as fling
2016-01-21 01:44:09	catpiggest	if you can use iptables you wont set up 100 layers of NAT. you'll do it properly ;)
2016-01-21 01:44:41	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: And if you're doing that much effort to network that many computers why not just use IPv6 for your obviously insane custom setup?
2016-01-21 01:44:56	+UberPinguin	!!! '--ignore-build-slot-operator-deps=y' is not a valid package atom.
2016-01-21 01:45:02	Smiley	FrostFeline: name a sane setup which requires 100's of layers of nat, and I'll explaion how to do it ;)
2016-01-21 01:45:08	+FrostFeline	You could even put up an ipv6 socks proxy that connects over ipv4
2016-01-21 01:45:14	catpiggest	FrostFeline, your software might not support ipv6
2016-01-21 01:45:19	+iamben	UberPinguin: i typoed maybe, s/build/built/
2016-01-21 01:46:11	Smiley	slowly my house is emptying of 'stuff
2016-01-21 01:46:16	*	Smiley ponders
2016-01-21 01:46:28	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Which reminds me of another project
2016-01-21 01:46:31	Smiley	why would a pre-sales job be offering 45k when most simular roles offer 30k...
2016-01-21 01:46:42	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Why hasn't anyone invented a UPNP proxy for port forwarding yet?
2016-01-21 01:46:43	Smiley	tho, it does request CCNA/CCNP, but 15k, just because you've got that?
2016-01-21 01:46:58	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Like if your network has 6 layers of routers internally
2016-01-21 01:46:59	+UberPinguin	yes
2016-01-21 01:46:59	Smiley	FrostFeline: a what?
2016-01-21 01:47:10	Smiley	oh, and it smashes it way out?
2016-01-21 01:47:17	+UberPinguin	Smiley: Cisco certs are money
2016-01-21 01:47:21	+FrostFeline	Smiley: Yeah, using UPnP-IGD
2016-01-21 01:47:24	Smiley	UberPinguin: Nod
2016-01-21 01:47:25	catpiggest	FrostFeline, if your network has 6 layers of routing then you most definitely do not want upnp screwing around with it
2016-01-21 01:47:31	Smiley	I did CCNA at uni many years ago
2016-01-21 01:47:37	Smiley	they declined to give us the actual certs
2016-01-21 01:47:44	+UberPinguin	o.O
2016-01-21 01:47:45	catpiggest	UberPinguin, but 15k for the ccna? o.O
2016-01-21 01:47:51	Smiley	catpiggest: yeah that's my thinking
2016-01-21 01:47:52	catpiggest	Smiley, you can do exam-only ccna
2016-01-21 01:47:53	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I can see more ISPs going to NAT IPv4 though.
2016-01-21 01:47:56	Smiley	GBP btw.
2016-01-21 01:47:56	catpiggest	costs like 100 quid

2016-01-21 01:48:30	Smiley	tunnel via that
2016-01-21 01:48:39	+FrostFeline	yeah but that's terrible
2016-01-21 01:48:55	catpiggest	FrostFeline, sure there is. pay extra to get a dedicated dynamic ipv44
2016-01-21 01:49:12	Smiley	v44? ?:PD
2016-01-21 01:49:16	+FrostFeline	that sound like garbage when they could just implement nat-pmp :)
2016-01-21 01:49:33	catpiggest	FrostFeline, which your provider wont enable because they want you to pay extra

2016-01-21 01:50:05	+FrostFeline	Kissing goodbye to low-cost p2p transmissions would be a pretty harsh competitive disadvantage for any ISP
2016-01-21 01:50:42	+FrostFeline	If you have to rent a server to do p2p you've basically added $20/month for people that actually use the internet for ... things
2016-01-21 01:51:07	catpiggest	well the one major ISP i know that uses GCN until recently even throttled sharehosters once you hit a certain amount of transfer in a day
2016-01-21 01:51:20	catpiggest	i'm sure it's coincidence that they're the cable monopoly
2016-01-21 01:51:34	+FrostFeline	it's comcastic! :D
2016-01-21 01:51:38	catpiggest	they also charge like 10€ less than what you pay for vdsl
2016-01-21 01:52:04	+FrostFeline	We should just shoot the cable company employees
2016-01-21 01:52:09	+FrostFeline	they're all evil ;)
2016-01-21 01:52:17	catpiggest	they're not at fault

2016-01-21 02:11:42	stintel	any using weechat to connect to freenode with ssl ?
2016-01-21 02:12:13	stintel	what's the cleanest fix for "peer's certificate is NOT trusted"?
2016-01-21 02:15:03	+FrostFeline	stintel: Add the intermediate CA for freenode?
2016-01-21 02:15:24	stintel	why is it not in ca-certificates in the first place :/
2016-01-21 02:15:53	+FrostFeline	stintel: Because different OSVs trust different CAs due to different policies I imagine.
2016-01-21 02:16:18	+FrostFeline	You can't reduce "trust" to something simple and convenient
2016-01-21 02:16:50	+FrostFeline	I remember for a while one of chrome or firefox didn't have the certs for the gentoo https certs
2016-01-21 02:16:52	+CcxCZ	I'm not even sure all the servers are signed by singular CA.
2016-01-21 02:17:04	+FrostFeline	and one of them didn't trust my uni!
2016-01-21 02:17:25	+FrostFeline	CcxCZ: Really? Shouldn't the freenode certs at least be signed by a freenode CA?
2016-01-21 02:17:28	catpiggest	hm, how many files can put in a directory on ext4 without thinking about it?
2016-01-21 02:17:28	+CcxCZ	Since freenode runs on donated hardware/connectivity…
2016-01-21 02:18:02	+FrostFeline	Who knows
2016-01-21 02:18:48	catpiggest	like, can i put a million files in an ext4 that uses default settings without problems? how about 10 million?
2016-01-21 02:18:50	+CcxCZ	I don't think there's such thing as freenode CA. You don't get to be accredited certificate authority easily.
2016-01-21 02:19:03	+FrostFeline	IRC has generally been poorer about maintaining chains of trust
2016-01-21 02:19:20	+FrostFeline	than "the web"
2016-01-21 02:19:45	+iamben	they need to fix that, i do all my important banking and financial transactions over irc
2016-01-21 02:19:50	+CcxCZ	anyway: http://www.freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml
2016-01-21 02:20:05	+FrostFeline	iamben: haw haw
2016-01-21 02:20:13	+FrostFeline	stintel: "Many systems install these by default, but some do not (such as FreeBSD, on which the package you wish to install is ca_root_nss, and the cafile to use would be /usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt). For most clients this should be sufficient. If not, you can download the required intermediate cert from Gandi and the root cert from InstantSSL."
2016-01-21 02:20:40	+FrostFeline	stintel: SO just add the gandi intermediate cert and the instantssl cert
2016-01-21 02:21:19	+FrostFeline	The freenode webpage will even serve you the correct intermediate certs over ssl :D
2016-01-21 02:21:27	+CcxCZ	If they're not there yet. Perhaps you just need to rehash the certificates and regenerate the ca file.
2016-01-21 02:21:48	+FrostFeline	CcxCZ: Do the freenode certs verify on your gentoo?
2016-01-21 02:21:53	+iamben	everything "just worked" for me on irssi/freenode/ssl

2016-01-21 02:33:50	catpiggest	whats quicklook?
2016-01-21 02:34:08	+FrostFeline	It's the mac name for the "preview" feature
2016-01-21 02:34:20	+FrostFeline	On windows if you double click a zip you descend into it like a directory.
2016-01-21 02:34:24	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-21 02:34:31	catpiggest	those tools exist, krusader uses them
2016-01-21 02:34:40	catpiggest	quicklook just needs to integrate them
2016-01-21 02:34:56	+FrostFeline	Of course, it doesn't have to be archive files. Your quicklook generator could display any information about a file
2016-01-21 02:35:11	+FrostFeline	You could have a QL plugin to display codec info
2016-01-21 02:36:00	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I think QL is just the OSX API, someone would have to write the plugin
2016-01-21 02:36:05	catpiggest	shrug
2016-01-21 02:36:20	catpiggest	speak to apple about forgetting features that were standard 2 decades ago ;)
2016-01-21 02:36:31	catpiggest	even windows has that ootb by now doesnt it?
2016-01-21 02:36:41	+FrostFeline	Yeah
2016-01-21 02:36:53	+FrostFeline	Just not one that also does tar gzip cpio etc etc
2016-01-21 02:37:04	catpiggest	well it's still windows
2016-01-21 02:37:09	catpiggest	does it do rar at least?
2016-01-21 02:37:41	+FrostFeline	I'd imagine not
2016-01-21 02:37:47	catpiggest	but there probably are plugins for that
2016-01-21 02:37:56	+FrostFeline	rar is patented and can suck it
2016-01-21 02:38:09	catpiggest	rar is very popular on windows
2016-01-21 02:38:23	SpaceToast	7zip is gaining popularity fairly quickly on windows
2016-01-21 02:38:28	SpaceToast	as opposed to rar
2016-01-21 02:38:29	+FrostFeline	No, your  10% compression ratio improvement is not worth switching away from 7zip
2016-01-21 02:38:34	dugz	yeah I was gonna say 7zip
2016-01-21 02:38:35	+FrostFeline	or just using zip for smaller files.
2016-01-21 02:38:46	+FrostFeline	Since everything does zip these days
2016-01-21 02:38:50	catpiggest	my friend got back to me on the broadcast studio question
2016-01-21 02:38:52	catpiggest	they use SDI
2016-01-21 02:38:55	SpaceToast	most people still using winrar typically have no clue what they're doing, though a single one of them actually likes the winrar UI more
2016-01-21 02:39:17	catpiggest	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_digital_interface
2016-01-21 02:39:30	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Like the people that rar movie files before torrenting them ;)
2016-01-21 02:39:37	SpaceToast	lol
2016-01-21 02:39:41	SpaceToast	that's outright silly yeah
2016-01-21 02:39:41	+FrostFeline	SpaceToast: nubs don't know video is already as compressed as it's going to get
2016-01-21 02:39:55	SpaceToast	but the overhead makes it look legit ;)
2016-01-21 02:40:05	catpiggest	FrostFeline, it used to make sense when file sizes were restricted
2016-01-21 02:40:10	+FrostFeline	Same with jpegs and other media files
2016-01-21 02:40:19	SpaceToast	catpiggest: it wouldn't help with file-size
2016-01-21 02:40:19	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Compressing video files makes them larger
2016-01-21 02:40:23	SpaceToast	yeah
2016-01-21 02:40:31	SpaceToast	it makes sense if you ZIP and then break-down into pieces
2016-01-21 02:40:32	catpiggest	now you sometimes get one large rar, containing 20MB rars of 1.44MB rars which then decompress to a compressed video filie
2016-01-21 02:40:43	SpaceToast	to be fair, compressing SEVERAL videos together MIGHT help a bit
2016-01-21 02:40:49	catpiggest	FrostFeline, difference is negligible
2016-01-21 02:41:13	+bonsaikitten	FrostFeline: rar has checksums
2016-01-21 02:41:16	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Sure, but it doesn't help converting a 700MB AVI file into a 700.1MB.tar file
2016-01-21 02:41:19	catpiggest	and yeah, i agree it's irritating that people make torrents of split-file archives because with torrent you dont need that
2016-01-21 02:41:27	+bonsaikitten	make 15MB archives and it's easier to move around without accidental byte errors
2016-01-21 02:41:27	+FrostFeline	bonsaikitten: So does bittorrent! It uses SHA1 :D
2016-01-21 02:41:36	+bonsaikitten	FrostFeline: but muuuh FTP
2016-01-21 02:41:42	+FrostFeline	rofl
2016-01-21 02:41:51	+iamben	rar was the de facto standard LOOOOOONG before torrents arrived
2016-01-21 02:42:03	dugz	those split files were popular on usenet
2016-01-21 02:42:11	+FrostFeline	The only thing an archive format makes sense for video right now is without compression.
2016-01-21 02:42:32	catpiggest	iamben, yeah, unfortunately some people still havent changed their workflow ^^
2016-01-21 02:42:48	+FrostFeline	So you might bundle 30 small video clips in a .tar file or such
2016-01-21 02:43:35	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: krusader is OSX native :D
2016-01-21 02:43:43	catpiggest	FrostFeline, ah, just use that then
2016-01-21 02:43:47	dugz	i would use 7zip, it knows not to compress video files and has nice features
2016-01-21 02:43:55	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Just need to hack in quicklook support
2016-01-21 02:44:23	+FrostFeline	finder isn't super great anyway

2016-01-21 02:52:09	catpiggest	whats tfw qt?
2016-01-21 02:52:10	+kensington	FrostFeline: fetch it from a mirror :D
2016-01-21 02:52:43	+FrostFeline	ah wtf
2016-01-21 02:52:46	_anomaly_	it was worse when nokia hosted it
2016-01-21 02:52:57	+FrostFeline	macports is fetching from canada... why? ykf.ca.distfiles.macports.org

2016-01-21 02:53:46	Smiley	_anomaly_: :D
2016-01-21 02:53:48	catpiggest	Smiley, yep
2016-01-21 02:53:52	catpiggest	if you gave the units correctly
2016-01-21 02:53:52	Smiley	o_O
2016-01-21 02:53:55	Smiley	that's pretty nice

2016-01-21 02:53:58	Smiley	right i'm, gone
2016-01-21 02:54:24	catpiggest	if it was GBytes then multiply by 8 and if necessary/desired adjust for the 1024-problem
2016-01-21 02:54:48	catpiggest	or if an error of approx 7% is irrelevant ignore the 1024-problem
2016-01-21 02:55:04	_anomaly_	or just ask wolfram alpha :p
2016-01-21 02:55:22	catpiggest	yeah there you can probably type it in in almost-english
2016-01-21 02:55:28	+FrostFeline	macports is like gentoo prefix, right?
2016-01-21 02:55:55	catpiggest	same idea, different implementation, AIUI
2016-01-21 02:55:57	+FrostFeline	I wonder how it compares from the standpoint of software catalog
2016-01-21 02:56:06	+Cheaterman	System Rescue CD
2016-01-21 02:56:07	+Cheaterman	is GOOD

2016-01-21 02:56:30	+Cheaterman	I'm using it as a custom deployment system
2016-01-21 02:56:40	damex	what would be the best way to look at the changes at sys/proc files ? doing so by cat is not cost effective :(
2016-01-21 02:56:41	+Cheaterman	idea: I boot it, I don't even press a key, the underlying machine gets my custom OS installed
2016-01-21 02:56:43	_anomaly_	FrostFeline: i find homebrew is a bit better than macports
2016-01-21 02:56:44	+Cheaterman	clean and mean
2016-01-21 02:57:21	catpiggest	Cheaterman, did you document the steps you needed to perform? because making such a deployment system is on my todo list lol
2016-01-21 02:57:37	+Cheaterman	More or les catpiggest, both scripts are on my git
2016-01-21 02:57:54	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: Go PXE or go home 8-)
2016-01-21 02:57:54	+Cheaterman	the idea is that one script goes inside the machine, will be executed through chroot and is for per-system configuration

2016-01-21 02:58:30	+Cheaterman	hardly even worth making a script for
2016-01-21 02:58:34	+Cheaterman	but I did :D
2016-01-21 02:58:37	+FrostFeline	fasteth is too slow for pxeinstall?
2016-01-21 02:58:41	+FrostFeline	Hm....
2016-01-21 02:58:45	+Cheaterman	8GiB images
2016-01-21 02:58:50	catpiggest	hm pxe.. yeah could use that i guess
2016-01-21 02:58:53	+Cheaterman	and I've been doing them over network all the time
2016-01-21 02:58:57	+Cheaterman	bt it'sa bit slow
2016-01-21 02:59:03	+FrostFeline	At 12MB/s shouldn't be too slow
2016-01-21 02:59:03	+Cheaterman	so ultimate goal, is to do it from USB :)
2016-01-21 02:59:11	+Cheaterman	12MiB/s is slow enough
2016-01-21 02:59:19	+FrostFeline	For 8GiB?
2016-01-21 02:59:19	+Cheaterman	compared to what I could get with a good stick and the SSD
2016-01-21 02:59:22	+Cheaterman	Yeah
2016-01-21 02:59:26	+Cheaterman	we're speed freaks here
2016-01-21 02:59:28	+Cheaterman	you have no idea
2016-01-21 02:59:28	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-01-21 02:59:40	+Cheaterman	How DARE YOU suggest I wait 15 mins
2016-01-21 02:59:45	+Cheaterman	I'm not THAT kind of person
2016-01-21 02:59:54	+Cheaterman	:-)
2016-01-21 02:59:55	catpiggest	Cheaterman, why the feth though? :P
2016-01-21 03:00:02	+Cheaterman	catpiggest: :-/ history
2016-01-21 03:00:04	catpiggest	i mean if you're actually using the network
2016-01-21 03:00:05	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: Google says 12 minutes to send that
2016-01-21 03:00:08	+Cheaterman	we need to make infra work on the office
2016-01-21 03:00:11	+Cheaterman	been saying this for six months hehe

2016-01-21 03:00:16	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: Perhaps if there was a bittorrent linux installer? :D

2016-01-21 03:00:41	+Cheaterman	I'm also thinking about just leveraging Gentoo properly
2016-01-21 03:00:47	+Cheaterman	with pkghost and everything
2016-01-21 03:00:57	+Cheaterman	I didn't get the time to do that yet though :-)
2016-01-21 03:01:01	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: Do you think that a bittorrent pxelinux installer would be a good idea?
2016-01-21 03:01:09	+Cheaterman	just went quick&dirty with the raw disk image
2016-01-21 03:01:10	+FrostFeline	Like just bittorrent over the lan
2016-01-21 03:01:21	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: not at all, because the concern is different
2016-01-21 03:01:23	catpiggest	Cheaterman, pkghost is on my todo list, too lol
2016-01-21 03:01:37	+Cheaterman	bittorrent comes from a concern of low upstream bandwidth vs fast downstream
2016-01-21 03:01:52	+Cheaterman	in lan you're symettric
2016-01-21 03:01:58	+Cheaterman	symmetric maybe
2016-01-21 03:01:59	+Cheaterman	anyways
2016-01-21 03:02:08	+Cheaterman	catpiggest: sounds like a good plan for me as well
2016-01-21 03:02:10	+bonsaikitten	BT scales quite well
2016-01-21 03:02:12	+Cheaterman	Just... didn't get the time to do it
2016-01-21 03:02:13	+FrostFeline	Yeah but your box only has one 1Gbps port, usually
2016-01-21 03:02:19	+bonsaikitten	I've seen it do >100Mbit/s in both directions
2016-01-21 03:02:25	+bonsaikitten	FrostFeline: barbaric ... so slow
2016-01-21 03:02:38	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: exactly. so if I saturate this port, doesn't matter weither it's bittorrent or samba
2016-01-21 03:02:41	catpiggest	FrostFeline, 10GE cards can be had for about 200€
2016-01-21 03:02:43	+Cheaterman	as long as the port is saturated
2016-01-21 03:02:53	catpiggest	still need a switch ofc
2016-01-21 03:02:57	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: I was thinking one low end box with a 1Gbps port doing pxe-bittorrent install on a network with hundreds of nodes
2016-01-21 03:03:13	+FrostFeline	Then the other nodes share bandwidth and you don't need to pay for 10GbE at all
2016-01-21 03:03:29	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: That does not solve the issue, all you're suggesting is to multiplex the data to parallel installs

2016-01-21 03:03:36	catpiggest	FrostFeline, 200€ is what, 4 hours of work? you're not gonna set up all the extra needed in 4 hours
2016-01-21 03:03:40	+Cheaterman	which I was thinking of... yesterday
2016-01-21 03:03:45	+Cheaterman	before I realized I was on 100Mbps
2016-01-21 03:03:56	+Cheaterman	get 6.5x faster USB3 speed
2016-01-21 03:04:03	+Cheaterman	(worst measurement)
2016-01-21 03:04:16	+Cheaterman	catpiggest++
2016-01-21 03:04:20	+Cheaterman	my boss would definitely buy me the NIC
2016-01-21 03:04:20	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: But no matter how much bandwidth you have, pxe will bottleneck it ;)
2016-01-21 03:04:35	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: actually TFTP itself is rather slow
2016-01-21 03:04:36	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: This way 100 machines takes the same time as 1
2016-01-21 03:04:53	catpiggest	FrostFeline, unless you reinstall all the machines every day thats not really an issue
2016-01-21 03:04:58	+FrostFeline	Wouldn't you use http for the main os downloads?
2016-01-21 03:05:02	+Cheaterman	that too hahaha catpiggest
2016-01-21 03:05:02	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: actually pxe-bittorrent sounds... interesting
2016-01-21 03:05:08	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: I use samba
2016-01-21 03:05:22	+Cheaterman	yes it's interesting
2016-01-21 03:05:26	+Cheaterman	as a funi weekend project
2016-01-21 03:05:29	catpiggest	if we take an extremely low estimate of reimaging every quarter you'd still only average about 11 machines a day if you have 1000 total
2016-01-21 03:05:29	+Cheaterman	not for actual stuff :p
2016-01-21 03:05:30	+FrostFeline	I thought tftp was only to download the bootlloader
2016-01-21 03:05:45	+Cheaterman	that's true FrostFeline but in my case i deploy raw disk images
2016-01-21 03:05:48	+Cheaterman	mentioned that already.
2016-01-21 03:05:49	+Cheaterman	:)

2016-01-21 03:06:08	+wiktor_b	tftp a bittorrent bootloader, have the machines seed their OS?
2016-01-21 03:06:20	+Cheaterman	catpiggest: the code is closed source, but knowledge never is ;-)

2016-01-21 03:16:04	catpiggest	torindel, whats that for, to ensure all the display devices on multiple systems switch frames simultaneously?
2016-01-21 03:16:12	torindel	catpiggest: as sli is recomended only on 2 cards
2016-01-21 03:16:15	+FrostFeline	that's even worse!
2016-01-21 03:16:19	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-21 03:16:28	catpiggest	guess that makes sense sorta
2016-01-21 03:16:53	+FrostFeline	Couldn't you do that simpler by just using the OS eth stack?
2016-01-21 03:17:00	torindel	catpiggest: and yea that is for those wierd folk that want 16 monitors synchronized into single display ^^
2016-01-21 03:17:01	+FrostFeline	NTP over LAN should be pretty precise.
2016-01-21 03:17:27	+FrostFeline	oh

2016-01-21 03:18:05	catpiggest	it is a bit confusing, i mean PCIe isnt exactly a low speed interface
2016-01-21 03:18:06	+FrostFeline	But still how is that easier than using the drivers on the computer to do the sync over pcie?
2016-01-21 03:19:04	torindel	FrostFeline: that allows remote sync too i think
2016-01-21 03:19:20	+FrostFeline	right,
2016-01-21 03:19:33	+FrostFeline	that seems like a lot of work compared to using the os eth stack to do that sync
2016-01-21 03:20:30	torindel	note they need low latency/high throughput for that too
2016-01-21 03:20:30	+iamben	FrostFeline: sounds like they should have called you before they spent millions of dollars developing this!
2016-01-21 03:20:40	+iamben	what noobs
2016-01-21 03:20:53	+FrostFeline	iamben: darn right. I r dabess
2016-01-21 03:21:07	catpiggest	maybe its for when the system's main eth links are heavily loaded
2016-01-21 03:21:32	torindel	iamben: they forgot to call bill g too, he would said them that 640kB of ram is more than enough, and that they wont ever need more ^^
2016-01-21 03:21:45	+FrostFeline	torindel: That's the awesomest misquote
2016-01-21 03:22:12	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I guess, switches that support L2 QoS are pricey
2016-01-21 03:22:48	catpiggest	FrostFeline, a few grand here or there on the switch are not much of an issue if you are looking at  graphics cards in the 3k€ range i would guess
2016-01-21 03:23:06	+FrostFeline	What's the point of optical media when HDDs are cheap and have better price/GB?

2016-01-21 03:24:07	catpiggest	certain types of financial records for example
2016-01-21 03:24:18	torindel	FrostFeline: also note: 2560(w)*1440(h)*4(32bpp)*60(hz) = 0.82GB/s <= you sure they dont need those ethernets? ;p
2016-01-21 03:24:48	+FrostFeline	I thought the ethernet was just for clock synchronization?

2016-01-21 03:25:30	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: yesterday I was talking about using BD-REs for archiving and people were telling me it's better to get HDDs
2016-01-21 03:25:33	torindel	and remote displays for those wierd multi-multi monitor mosaic setups
2016-01-21 03:25:37	+FrostFeline	Now I'm just confused.
2016-01-21 03:25:41	catpiggest	FrostFeline, yep for most situations it is

2016-01-21 03:25:59	catpiggest	but there are certain situations where that may not be an option available to the engineer
2016-01-21 03:27:34	+FrostFeline	So what's the situation in which BD-RE would actually be useful?
2016-01-21 03:27:58	+FrostFeline	You don't get durability in optical discs without using pressed media anyway, right?
2016-01-21 03:28:02	+iamben	i think BD makes sense if you need to hand out 50GB of data to a whole bunch of different parties
2016-01-21 03:28:19	+iamben	but burning a whole stack of discs to keep in one place is a waste of time
2016-01-21 03:28:45	+FrostFeline	This bluray burner was a waste then! ;_;
2016-01-21 03:29:15	+FrostFeline	Well, at least I can use it to watch jet li beat up jet li in 1080pHD with 5.1 DTS
2016-01-21 03:29:18	dugz	i just put in cheap dvd burners
2016-01-21 03:29:21	catpiggest	bluray is a waste full stop hehe
2016-01-21 03:29:31	catpiggest	with certain exceptions, as always
2016-01-21 03:29:46	+FrostFeline	I found out that makemkv is actually free while in beta
2016-01-21 03:29:58	+Chainsaw	This is true.
2016-01-21 03:30:02	+FrostFeline	and a mac os x bluray player that supports menus is $35
2016-01-21 03:30:09	+FrostFeline	So it wasn't a total loss!
2016-01-21 03:30:21	+Chainsaw	You do have to make the effort of checking their forum for the beta key every other month or so.
2016-01-21 03:30:26	+FrostFeline	Movies is part of the reason why I got the bluray drive instead of a dvd superdrive anway
2016-01-21 03:30:28	+Chainsaw	But that seems fair.
2016-01-21 03:30:47	+FrostFeline	I figured hey why not since you can buy blurays for 5-12USD
2016-01-21 03:31:15	+FrostFeline	Cheaterman: yer, I'll use makemkv to rip all my blurays to my HDDs :)
2016-01-21 03:31:15	catpiggest	really? thats actually a decent price, if they can be ripped
2016-01-21 03:31:31	catpiggest	not gonna return to being a DJ for watching videos
2016-01-21 03:31:34	+FrostFeline	No, the player is something called macgo and its $35
2016-01-21 03:31:51	catpiggest	i mean the 5-12$ for a movie on bluray
2016-01-21 03:31:54	+FrostFeline	When MakeMKV comes out of beta it will be $50

2016-01-21 03:32:38	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I picked up Jet Li's "The One" at microcenter for 5USD
2016-01-21 03:32:56	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Giantfood also has bargain blurays
2016-01-21 03:32:58	catpiggest	i think i already have that
2016-01-21 03:33:03	catpiggest	but the dvd version
2016-01-21 03:33:08	cnnx	vonage claims fax machines work on their service, can anyone tell me if a fax connection is similar to a data modem connection?
2016-01-21 03:33:34	+iamben	whoa did we just slip into 1996?
2016-01-21 03:33:39	+likewhoa	lol
2016-01-21 03:33:46	catpiggest	hehe
2016-01-21 03:33:49	cnnx	:)
2016-01-21 03:33:52	catpiggest	optical discs, faxes
2016-01-21 03:33:54	+likewhoa	fax machines are like using dial up modem to access the internet
2016-01-21 03:34:04	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: blast from the past ;)
2016-01-21 03:34:25	cnnx	likewhoa: yes but im trying to deduct if a modem works with vonage since they say fax machines do work with vonage
2016-01-21 03:34:32	+FrostFeline	iamben: 1080p60 5.1 surround with subtitles is nothing to shake a stick at
2016-01-21 03:34:48	+FrostFeline	cnnx: Step 1 plug a fax into vonage step 2 use a web fax service to test :)
2016-01-21 03:34:54	catpiggest	cnnx, that seems a bit insane :P

2016-01-21 03:35:29	catpiggest	ofc they work using the same physics principle (you can transmit data in the form of noises)
2016-01-21 03:35:32	redeyedman	:D
2016-01-21 03:35:46	torindel	cnnx: note: most of modems did support fax protocol too
2016-01-21 03:36:00	cnnx	torindel: i know that
2016-01-21 03:36:07	catpiggest	yeah but he wants to use a modem over VoIP
2016-01-21 03:36:11	catpiggest	which i call a little insane
2016-01-21 03:36:11	cnnx	right
2016-01-21 03:36:15	catpiggest	;)
2016-01-21 03:36:18	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: In rapture of the nerds the superAIs turn this guy's voicebox into a modem
2016-01-21 03:36:24	catpiggest	probably best to just ask them
2016-01-21 03:36:34	cnnx	they dont know anything
2016-01-21 03:36:35	torindel	cnnx: that should work too, but slooow ;]
2016-01-21 03:36:38	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Would you upgrade to a modem larynx? :)
2016-01-21 03:36:39	cnnx	i called them this morning
2016-01-21 03:36:53	dugz	you know the voip data compression is gonna screw with the modem data
2016-01-21 03:36:54	cnnx	"whats a modem"
2016-01-21 03:37:21	torindel	dugz: faxes used digital encoding too
2016-01-21 03:37:35	cnnx	anyways they have a 30 day money back garanttee
2016-01-21 03:37:39	cnnx	i pay 10$ and im done
2016-01-21 03:37:44	cnnx	i get my 10$ back if i mail it back
2016-01-21 03:37:46	dugz	torindel, i find it hard to believe that faxes work through voip
2016-01-21 03:38:00	+FrostFeline	I don't undestand why a fax wouldn't work over voip
2016-01-21 03:38:06	cnnx	FrostFeline: it does
2016-01-21 03:38:13	+FrostFeline	VoIP should just be an "extra noisy line" to a fax
2016-01-21 03:38:16	cnnx	FrostFeline: they say to just plug in your fax into their adapter
2016-01-21 03:38:38	dugz	well a 9600 baud modem might work then
2016-01-21 03:38:54	+iamben	they probably just detect fax/modem and have special handling for it
2016-01-21 03:38:55	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Remember the modem adapters that would clip to your headset? :)
2016-01-21 03:39:00	cnnx	http://www.vonage.com/personal/features/fax-lines
2016-01-21 03:39:10	cnnx	dugz: thats what im thinking
2016-01-21 03:39:14	torindel	dugz: plus faxes wherent that much faster than 9600 ^^
2016-01-21 03:39:20	+iamben	it's not like they can only use a single codec for anythign that travels over "voip"
2016-01-21 03:39:28	dugz	no, maybe 14.4k max
2016-01-21 03:39:36	torindel	V.17 is 14400
2016-01-21 03:39:40	cnnx	iamben: they have a disclaimer on their main page "modems may or may not work with our service"
2016-01-21 03:39:44	+chithead	fax g3 is 14400
2016-01-21 03:39:44	cnnx	so its possible it does work
2016-01-21 03:40:00	torindel	and slowest wass 300b/s ^^
2016-01-21 03:40:12	+chithead	if the voip provider supports t.38 then fax at full speed should work

2016-01-21 03:41:49	cnnx	i find that hard to believe
2016-01-21 03:41:54	+chithead	it might work if both endpoints are t.38 capable

2016-01-21 03:45:34	catpiggest	is this related to the bbs discussions here the other nigt?

2016-01-21 03:46:16	catpiggest	cnnx, if it doesnt work try reducing bitrate. the 56k modem should support incredibly low bit rates, probably down to 300b/s

2016-01-21 03:55:19	dugz	i have a 200MHz Arm Netwinder running gentoo
2016-01-21 03:55:21	catpiggest	torindel, ah the robotron appears to have been essentially indestructible
2016-01-21 03:55:32	catpiggest	my mum accidentally emptied 5 or 10l of water into it whilst it was on
2016-01-21 03:55:50	torindel	^^
2016-01-21 03:56:04	catpiggest	and after we had long ago moved to wintel and the thing was at my grandparents it started to smell funky so they threw it out
2016-01-21 03:56:36	+FrostFeline	woot qt finished building
2016-01-21 03:56:43	torindel	FrostFeline: gz
2016-01-21 03:56:43	+FrostFeline	qt 4.8.7, even
2016-01-21 03:56:52	catpiggest	more retro stuff ^^
2016-01-21 03:57:13	dugz	i need a new project. i have finished my uefi experiments
2016-01-21 03:57:17	catpiggest	tho i still have 4.8.6, too
2016-01-21 03:57:33	catpiggest	dugz, get coreboot and libreboot to work on your mobo
2016-01-21 03:57:43	catpiggest	100 bonus points if it is the exact same mobo as mine
2016-01-21 03:57:47	dugz	catpiggest, that would be quite the project
2016-01-21 03:57:56	dugz	does coreboot even work?
2016-01-21 03:58:13	catpiggest	not sure, havent had the chance to try it yet unfortunately
2016-01-21 03:58:23	catpiggest	well, lets rephrase
2016-01-21 03:58:49	catpiggest	i valued speed/features and price higher than the ability to install coreboot
2016-01-21 03:59:29	+FrostFeline	I use par2 to add 30% data redundancy to all my important data :D
2016-01-21 03:59:48	catpiggest	FrostFeline, just run raid5 on 4 drives ;)
2016-01-21 04:00:01	+FrostFeline	I don't have 4 drives in any of my computers
2016-01-21 04:00:10	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-21 04:00:25	Smiley	lol
2016-01-21 04:00:30	+FrostFeline	I have 4 new drives total
2016-01-21 04:00:46	+FrostFeline	and 3 old ones that I wouldn't trust anything important to (10 yrs+)
2016-01-21 04:00:58	catpiggest	hm i got about 10 or 15 under my control
2016-01-21 04:01:26	+FrostFeline	If my disk crashes I can send it into a data recovery center and ask for an image ;)
2016-01-21 04:01:29	catpiggest	only counting TB or larger, except the 2 SSDs
2016-01-21 04:01:30	dugz	i have a box of old drives
2016-01-21 04:01:52	+FrostFeline	Do any archiving systems like rar have error correction?
2016-01-21 04:02:13	dugz	FrostFeline, you mean besides rar?
2016-01-21 04:02:28	catpiggest	many have error detection. not sure if anyone builds correction into the archive format though
2016-01-21 04:02:31	+FrostFeline	Yes
2016-01-21 04:02:47	+FrostFeline	afaik there's dvdisaster and par2
2016-01-21 04:02:56	dugz	rar can make *.par parity files
2016-01-21 04:03:09	torindel	FrostFeline: high compression algorithms dont have any error correction at all since that would use space, so only checksum for files
2016-01-21 04:03:32	catpiggest	you could bz2 or whatever and then run par2 on the resulting archive
2016-01-21 04:03:57	+FrostFeline	If you have a single disk you could use LVM for error correction
2016-01-21 04:04:16	+FrostFeline	split it into 3 PVs and RAID10 or whatever the right number is
2016-01-21 04:04:26	catpiggest	raid1
2016-01-21 04:04:36	Smiley	ewww
2016-01-21 04:04:37	catpiggest	for mirroring
2016-01-21 04:04:40	Smiley	do not do that plz :/
2016-01-21 04:04:43	catpiggest	and yeah, ewww ^^
2016-01-21 04:04:46	Smiley	use lvm mirroring if you must
2016-01-21 04:04:49	+FrostFeline	Yes but raid1 would cut the disk in 1/3
2016-01-21 04:05:03	Smiley	but that is still not a backup
2016-01-21 04:05:06	catpiggest	well normally people run raid1 pairs
2016-01-21 04:05:08	Smiley	FrostFeline: so 4 new drives, how many systems?
2016-01-21 04:05:11	catpiggest	so you lose half
2016-01-21 04:05:14	+FrostFeline	No it's not, it's error corrections
2016-01-21 04:05:19	+FrostFeline	Smiley: 4 drives 2 systems
2016-01-21 04:05:28	catpiggest	just run mdraid1?

2016-01-21 04:05:29	Smiley	2 drives in each system
2016-01-21 04:05:37	catpiggest	you dont have to use it over the whole drive
2016-01-21 04:05:38	Smiley	one drive for the 'local' system, one for the 'other' systems backups
2016-01-21 04:05:44	+FrostFeline	Smiley: 1x1TB+1x2TB,2x2TB

2016-01-21 04:06:08	catpiggest	say you have a 1T drive and 2T drive. you could make a raid1 mirror on 200GB (using 200G of each drive) and use the rest plain
2016-01-21 04:06:17	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: I was just thinking use LVM for 30% parity

2016-01-21 04:06:50	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: That doesn't cost you a whole extra drive and can let you save your data if the disk starts to die
2016-01-21 04:06:57	Smiley	how much data you got to store?
2016-01-21 04:07:06	+FrostFeline	Not much, really
2016-01-21 04:07:12	+FrostFeline	A few hundred GB
2016-01-21 04:07:17	catpiggest	FrostFeline, as noted, you dont have to use whole drives for mdraid
2016-01-21 04:07:26	+FrostFeline	ah
2016-01-21 04:07:41	+FrostFeline	Windows softraid kind of sucks hue hue
2016-01-21 04:07:50	+FrostFeline	It won't let you raid your boot volume
2016-01-21 04:07:57	catpiggest	for quite a while i had 4 equal-sized drives, so i ran RAID1 on the first 10G or something for /boot and /, and then a RAID5 over the remainder of the drives
2016-01-21 04:08:19	catpiggest	and then 2 drives failed ^^
2016-01-21 04:08:26	Smiley	lol
2016-01-21 04:08:31	+FrostFeline	So I decided nuts to it
2016-01-21 04:08:34	dugz	i should setup a raid VM in virtualbox using a bunch of disk image files :)   I don't know jack about raid arrays
2016-01-21 04:08:37	Smiley	and u had backups?
2016-01-21 04:08:46	 < 	pereira_alex (~alexandre@88.157.204.58) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2016-01-21 04:08:48	+FrostFeline	I'll just use them as flat discs and use the windows box as a straight up backup
2016-01-21 04:08:50	catpiggest	one died completely, one gave errors. so i ddrescued the one with errors and managed to recover the array with an estimated loss of about 1MB of data
2016-01-21 04:08:54	catpiggest	Smiley, nope
2016-01-21 04:08:56	Smiley	dugz: there u go, new prohject
2016-01-21 04:09:07	+FrostFeline	So I have 1 copy of my data on windows 1 copy on my mac and 1 copy on the external HDD using time machine.
2016-01-21 04:09:10	catpiggest	dugz, mdraid is easy, try it
2016-01-21 04:09:29	*	dugz puts on his Raid Helmet
2016-01-21 04:09:30	catpiggest	especially raid1
2016-01-21 04:09:31	Smiley	so if ur house burns down ur screwed?
2016-01-21 04:09:45	+FrostFeline	My house won't burn down ;)
2016-01-21 04:09:50	catpiggest	because with raid1 you dont need bootloader support
2016-01-21 04:09:52	Smiley	no?
2016-01-21 04:10:10	+iamben	-said every house fire victim ever
2016-01-21 04:10:27	+FrostFeline	iamben: My house is made of asbestos and steel ok?
2016-01-21 04:10:36	+FrostFeline	iamben: Even the bedsheets are asbestos
2016-01-21 04:10:36	Smiley	so ull diedd too
2016-01-21 04:10:49	Smiley	everything bvurens
2016-01-21 04:10:55	Smiley	everything burns
2016-01-21 04:11:28	+FrostFeline	Well if you apply enough energy you can rearrange the atoms of anything
2016-01-21 04:11:50	+FrostFeline	But no, asbestos does not "burn" in the sense of creating a self-sustaining fire
2016-01-21 04:12:08	+FrostFeline	Not unless you live inside a blowtorch
2016-01-21 04:12:13	catpiggest	FrostFeline, what if we soaked it in petrol?
2016-01-21 04:12:38	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Hah. I don't think petrol burns hot enough unless you're blowing pure oxygen at it
2016-01-21 04:12:55	+iamben	anyway there is no way to protect against ALL risk, just protect against the risks you want to survive =)
2016-01-21 04:13:00	catpiggest	what if we soaked it in pure petrol, and then blow pure oxygen on it
2016-01-21 04:13:09	+FrostFeline	Who knows :P

2016-01-21 04:13:25	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: That wouldn't really be the asbestos "burning" in the conventional sense anyway
2016-01-21 04:13:46	+FrostFeline	Since it requires a continual supply of external energy
2016-01-21 04:13:54	catpiggest	true
2016-01-21 04:14:10	+FrostFeline	If lightning struck a house made of nothing but metal and asbestos the fire would die out pretty quick
2016-01-21 04:15:13	+FrostFeline	time machine had an oops with my toshiba disk
2016-01-21 04:15:20	+FrostFeline	ruh roh
2016-01-21 04:15:27	catpiggest	what if you build your asbestos house on an oil tanker made out of flammable plastics
2016-01-21 04:15:29	+FrostFeline	Might be because things are compiling in the background
2016-01-21 04:15:40	Smiley	also it'd likely take out all your eletrics with it
2016-01-21 04:15:40	Smiley	yey
2016-01-21 04:15:53	+FrostFeline	Smiley: Yeah
2016-01-21 04:15:56	Smiley	1 disk down
2016-01-21 04:16:04	Smiley	we watching the failure live
2016-01-21 04:16:11	+FrostFeline	Smiley: That's why I surrond my house in a faraday cage :)
2016-01-21 04:16:20	Smiley	:O
2016-01-21 04:16:29	+FrostFeline	I bet for a couple million I can insulate it against direct lightning strikes
2016-01-21 04:16:32	+FrostFeline	:P
2016-01-21 04:16:52	+FrostFeline	or just hire chuck norris to roundhouse kick the lightning
2016-01-21 04:16:57	catpiggest	what do you call those things again that people put on houses to catch lighting and lead it into the ground?
2016-01-21 04:17:01	Smiley	u could just by having some stotage else where yoo lol
2016-01-21 04:17:05	+FrostFeline	lightning rods :)
2016-01-21 04:17:09	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-21 04:17:23	catpiggest	get one of those ;)
2016-01-21 04:17:39	+FrostFeline	how much is that?
2016-01-21 04:17:45	catpiggest	dunno
2016-01-21 04:17:51	+FrostFeline	I thought lightning protection was expensive
2016-01-21 04:17:53	catpiggest	one would hope your house already has one in any case
2016-01-21 04:18:02	Smiley	o_O
2016-01-21 04:18:04	Smiley	no...
2016-01-21 04:18:07	catpiggest	i thought they're standard
2016-01-21 04:18:10	+FrostFeline	at least for complete safety from lightning
2016-01-21 04:18:17	Smiley	my parwnts house was struck twice lol
2016-01-21 04:18:18	+FrostFeline	catpiggest: Probably in areas with lightning
2016-01-21 04:18:35	Smiley	they are in.... germany?? I think
2016-01-21 04:18:42	catpiggest	ah

2016-01-21 05:58:37	cnnx	iamben: ok
2016-01-21 05:59:53	+eroen	There are a number of half-baked autoinstallers, but mostly for generating VM images.
2016-01-21 05:59:59	+eroen	I even wrote one myself :P
2016-01-21 06:00:22	cnnx	what is the main reason gentoo devs didnt ever write an installer?
2016-01-21 06:00:42	catpiggest	there's also gentoo derivatives like sabayon
2016-01-21 06:00:45	+eroen	very little demand
2016-01-21 06:00:47	+iamben	because to be as flexible & usable as a manual install is hard
2016-01-21 06:01:07	cnnx	iamben: automatic installs are too generic then?
2016-01-21 06:01:08	+iamben	what is inherently difficult about a manual gentoo install? nothing
2016-01-21 06:01:16	cnnx	iamben: I agree.
2016-01-21 06:01:42	+iamben	what woudl you automate, the fetch & unpack?  the partitioning? the chrooting?  all these things can benefit from flexibility of manual commands
2016-01-21 06:02:02	cnnx	it also assumes a certain level of knowledge from the user
2016-01-21 06:02:08	cnnx	to be comfortable in those tools
2016-01-21 06:02:11	+eroen	also in my experience all autoinstallers suck for desktop systems because I /always/ need to do something they don't like :/
2016-01-21 06:02:33	catpiggest	cnnx, which they will still need after the first boot. might as well learn it during install
2016-01-21 06:02:46	cnnx	like a newbie could type /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdb and delete the wrong partition if he's not carefull
2016-01-21 06:02:51	+eroen	either add some driver to kernel, re-use an existing luks partition or something similar

2016-01-21 06:03:41	catpiggest	ok requires a bit more negligence maybe
2016-01-21 06:04:27	cnnx	for me, when i do the occasional gentoo new install I always refer to an old document i printed which works pretty good except for the fetching files part which seems to have different paths

2016-01-21 06:24:09	cnnx	are you there now?
2016-01-21 06:24:12	mvaenskae	nah
2016-01-21 06:24:25	cnnx	brb have something on the stove
2016-01-21 06:24:26	mvaenskae	less chance to find a russian in here when a finn is in this chat :D
2016-01-21 06:24:27	+Milo-	he moved to russia, because he's a communist
2016-01-21 06:24:44	mvaenskae	Milo-: as stated, i am not in russia
2016-01-21 06:24:49	+Milo-	:P
2016-01-21 06:24:59	mvaenskae	might be seen as a declaration of war
2016-01-21 06:25:02	mvaenskae	and its winter
2016-01-21 06:25:11	mvaenskae	they still have memories i guess :D
2016-01-21 06:25:37	mvaenskae	anyways, gotta clean my hands
2016-01-21 06:25:41	+Milo-	mvaenskae funny enough, I responded to your "I am from finland though" and "nah" to the question "are you there now?"
2016-01-21 06:25:45	+Milo-	without seeing the rest of the conversation
2016-01-21 06:25:55	mvaenskae	full of grease
2016-01-21 06:25:56	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: well, owiii
2016-01-21 06:26:42	+Milo-	the funny part was the russia part in the upper part of the conversation (the one I missed)

2016-01-21 06:54:29	+hosler	it just makes a tone and does stuff when phone numbers get punched in
2016-01-21 06:54:53	+hosler	premade ones are expensive for some reason
2016-01-21 06:54:56	cnnx	ok but u cant make calls with a modem with it can u?

2016-01-21 07:03:24	+hosler	because why not
2016-01-21 07:05:49	+iamben	the usb one is probably semi-softmodem where the serial one is all hard
2016-01-21 07:06:02	cnnx	iamben: softmodem? it works on my gentoo system
2016-01-21 07:06:04	+iamben	and they're both more expensive than one would like, since it's antique tech
2016-01-21 07:06:23	+hosler	it's not antique
2016-01-21 07:06:26	+hosler	just analog

2016-01-21 11:39:26	SpaceToast	rebooting probably would kill it, but w.e
2016-01-21 11:39:32	+hosler	i guess there is no reason why you should ever change it back
2016-01-21 11:39:36	SpaceToast	that's cuz it's hard-coded

2016-01-21 11:40:03	SpaceToast	if you changed the hardcoded path to libc.conf it'd work fine tho

2016-01-21 11:40:17	+hosler	every*
2016-01-21 11:42:14	SpaceToast	well yeah, my point is that extension is not any more "special" than any other part of the filename
2016-01-21 11:42:27	SpaceToast	if you renamed it to libd.so.6 it'd have the exact same effects

2016-01-21 11:44:06	+hosler	file extensions
2016-01-21 11:44:12	+hosler	are they important?
2016-01-21 11:44:18	+hosler	or useless
2016-01-21 11:45:31	+zlg	I think they're useful for humans to remember what type a file is. afaik we use magic numbers for programs to figure out what type of data is in a file, so file extensions are mostly for people.

2016-01-21 11:48:47	+hosler	i like how you justify ur gif
2016-01-21 11:48:49	SpaceToast	the original idea is pretty good
2016-01-21 11:48:58	+zlg	And that, to me, smells of event-based programming
2016-01-21 11:49:13	+zlg	Pass messages around, objects act on those messages.
2016-01-21 11:49:15	SpaceToast	1. it's Graphics, not Jraphics. 2. if it was pronounced jiff, it'd be written jif. 3. your argument is invalid :^)

2016-01-21 11:49:31	+hosler	how do you say scuba
2016-01-21 11:49:39	SpaceToast	I say scuba
2016-01-21 11:49:46	+hosler	hard u?
2016-01-21 11:49:47	+zlg	SpaceToast: I dunno. You can make event loops with C, can't you?

2016-01-21 11:50:02	SpaceToast	zlg: based on what you defined as event-based, pretty much every language is event-based
2016-01-21 11:50:04	+zlg	I don't know enough about event-based programming to give a strong opinion on it.
2016-01-21 11:50:08	+hosler	scuba divers dive ooooonder water
2016-01-21 11:50:15	SpaceToast	consider asm. You mov a b. That's a message to the CPU and it acts on it ;)
2016-01-21 11:50:32	+zlg	SpaceToast: I guess more specifically I'm talking about things like hooks or On* events in Javascript.
2016-01-21 11:50:47	SpaceToast	not really what smalltalk was about
2016-01-21 11:50:51	+zlg	Ah
2016-01-21 11:51:06	+zlg	What was it about?
2016-01-21 11:51:15	SpaceToast	message passing ;)
2016-01-21 11:51:17	SpaceToast	for example
2016-01-21 11:51:20	SpaceToast	is dbus "event driven"?
2016-01-21 11:51:27	SpaceToast	consider having a read: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MessagePassing
2016-01-21 11:51:57	djdunn	has anyone got steam running with gcc5?
2016-01-21 11:52:02	+zlg	dbus is a mess is what it is :p
2016-01-21 11:52:17	djdunn	systemd is a bigger mess than dbus
2016-01-21 11:52:23	+zlg	No argument here.
2016-01-21 11:52:46	+zlg	Whenever I see dbus error out, it reminds me of Java namespaces.
2016-01-21 11:52:50	djdunn	systemd devs could not understand su, so they rewrote su
2016-01-21 11:52:51	+zlg	Who thought that was a sane idea?
2016-01-21 11:53:04	+zlg	djdunn: They've subsumed that now, too? haha
2016-01-21 11:53:10	+zlg	Soon enough it'll be able to send e-mail.
2016-01-21 11:53:13	djdunn	they did that awhile ago
2016-01-21 11:53:34	djdunn	poettering couldnt grasp what su was doing so rewrote it
2016-01-21 11:53:54	+zlg	It already comes with a boot chart plotter, hostname setter, I think an NTP client, web server...
2016-01-21 11:53:58	+zlg	The attack surface is broad.
2016-01-21 11:54:15	djdunn	yeah
2016-01-21 11:54:41	djdunn	its gonna take just 1 or 2 big issues to cripple systemd development
2016-01-21 11:54:41	+zlg	I mean sure, it's separated into a lot of little binaries that work together, but the problem is they work *only with each other*.
2016-01-21 11:55:29	+zlg	I dunno. It has a lot of commercial backing so they'll be swift to sweep things under the rug and act like everything's okay.
2016-01-21 11:55:43	+zlg	It'd be funny to see a team of dedicated crackers turn it into Swiss cheese.
2016-01-21 11:56:20	+zlg	Their userbase is already accustomed to keeping with the latest version, even if compatibility breaks temporarily.
2016-01-21 11:56:22	djdunn	ehhh
2016-01-21 11:57:08	+zlg	What type of big issue do you think would cripple its development?

2016-01-21 12:17:48	+zlg	mvaenskae: I already do.
2016-01-21 12:18:17	+zlg	I installed It's All Text in Firefox, which will pull up vim in urxvt for me.
2016-01-21 12:18:22	+zlg	Even on Windows, I have gvim
2016-01-21 12:18:40	+zlg	I simply can't do any serious text editing without Vim.
2016-01-21 12:18:53	+zlg	I am one with the modes.
2016-01-21 12:19:14	+zlg	Using vimperator in Firefox, too... >_>;
2016-01-21 12:19:48	Tear	oh no will that happen to me too
2016-01-21 12:20:06	fs0ciety	i just use cygwin in windows, and use an X server on top of the windows desktop so I don't have to see it
2016-01-21 12:20:26	fs0ciety	zlg: but yes vimperator for the win :)
2016-01-21 12:23:19	+zlg	fs0ciety: Hah, wow. You're more dedicated than me. I just jump over to Windows when I want to play a game that won't work on Gentoo.
2016-01-21 12:23:52	Tear	cygwin is the only way to ssh with an ed25519 key that i know of
2016-01-21 12:24:19	Tear	(on windows)
2016-01-21 12:24:24	djdunn	wasnt hard to run steam native
2016-01-21 12:24:25	+zlg	putty and kitty don't support it?
2016-01-21 12:24:30	Tear	nope
2016-01-21 12:24:32	djdunn	find ~/.local/share/Steam/ \( -name libgcc_s.so* -o -name libstdc++.so* \) -print -delete
2016-01-21 12:24:47	djdunn	cause yeah its kinda broken with new gcc version
2016-01-21 12:24:52	+zlg	djdunn: Careful with that. Steam loves to break every now and then.
2016-01-21 12:25:02	djdunn	but jest zlg ?
2016-01-21 12:25:16	Tear	i ended up disabling the entire steam runtime to get the games to work
2016-01-21 12:25:18	mvaenskae	zlg: in case you care about proper unicode support i can recommend a configured st
2016-01-21 12:25:25	djdunn	Tear: you can do that?
2016-01-21 12:25:26	mvaenskae	it is really great
2016-01-21 12:25:31	fs0ciety	zlg: unfortunately i game mostly in windows because i have two 970s and well linux support for sli is really poor
2016-01-21 12:25:33	Tear	STEAM_RUNTIME=0 steam
2016-01-21 12:25:43	+zlg	fs0ciety: Ah, that sucks.
2016-01-21 12:25:43	djdunn	Tear: do you run ~amd64
2016-01-21 12:25:46	Tear	yeah
2016-01-21 12:25:46	mvaenskae	zlg: have you found a solution for chromium maybe?
2016-01-21 12:26:01	djdunn	whats wrong with chromium?
2016-01-21 12:26:02	+zlg	mvaenskae: An equivalent to It's All Text? No clue, I don't trust Google.
2016-01-21 12:26:15	fs0ciety	zlg: it does. i hope with vulkan that sli support will improve on linux

2016-01-21 12:27:30	+zlg	But as for an external editor for <textareas>, no clue
2016-01-21 12:27:51	mvaenskae	zlg+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2016-01-21 12:28:06	+zlg	Given how locked down Google's extension system is, it may not even be possible for an extension to launch an external program.

2016-01-21 12:28:27	+zlg	for real? Haha
2016-01-21 12:28:35	+zlg	Just search the extension store or whatever for "vim"
2016-01-21 12:28:55	djdunn	why would you need vim for pr0n
2016-01-21 12:29:12	+zlg	djdunn: dat textwidth and ultisnips.
2016-01-21 12:29:36	+zlg	Who needs pr0n when you have a beautiful text editor at your beck and call? :P
2016-01-21 12:29:43	mvaenskae	i had it installed within 5 seconds the moment you mentioned it

2016-01-21 12:30:29	+zlg	Thinking about getting rid of selectivecookiedelete in favor of something a little smarter to manage my cookies.
2016-01-21 12:30:45	+zlg	And replacing RequestPolicy would be nice, but I can't think of anything automated that would do a better job.
2016-01-21 12:31:05	+zlg	The Web's turned into such a nightmare these days.
2016-01-21 12:31:21	catpigger	what would you replace requestpolicy with :/
2016-01-21 12:31:24	+zlg	It's part of why I'm curious about gopher
2016-01-21 12:31:45	+zlg	catpigger: People suggest Ghostery, but I don't think it solves the same problems.
2016-01-21 12:31:47	mvaenskae	omg, it has a tab search function :o
2016-01-21 12:31:58	catpigger	me neither
2016-01-21 12:32:15	catpigger	there is some overlap of course
2016-01-21 12:32:16	+zlg	I wish I could be more specific with my requestpolicy rules.
2016-01-21 12:32:19	+zlg	regex would be nice
2016-01-21 12:32:30	catpigger	i dont even have requestpolicy atm, too much of a PITA
2016-01-21 12:32:45	mvaenskae	that is firefox, right?
2016-01-21 12:32:56	+zlg	I think there's a way to run it where it accepts everything except what's in your blacklist.
2016-01-21 12:32:57	mvaenskae	i went with some adblocker and noscript usually
2016-01-21 12:33:01	+zlg	That could be a better way to browse.
2016-01-21 12:33:02	mvaenskae	that was suffficient
2016-01-21 12:33:02	catpigger	these days rarely a day goes by where i dont have to close a page without reading/viewing the content or activate JS just to see the basic content -.-
2016-01-21 12:33:13	+zlg	catpigger: No kidding.
2016-01-21 12:33:31	+zlg	Unless I absolutely need it to do some sort of business, if I have to have JS on to view a site, they just lost a visitor.
2016-01-21 12:33:34	catpigger	mvaenskae, adblocker (adblock plus), ghostery and noscript are my minimum :)
2016-01-21 12:33:53	mvaenskae	i am not certain if ghostery is needed with a good adblocker
2016-01-21 12:33:59	catpigger	i'll probably install requestpolicy again as well, at least for the important VMs
2016-01-21 12:34:01	+zlg	I'm more of a uBlock Origin, NoScript, RequestPolicy, selectivecookiedelete kind of guy.
2016-01-21 12:34:06	catpigger	mvaenskae, not sure, but no harm in having both
2016-01-21 12:34:11	+zlg	I even have a custom hosts file just in case I missed something.
2016-01-21 12:34:13	catpigger	except maybe a bit of lost performance
2016-01-21 12:34:18	+zlg	My router does filtering, too
2016-01-21 12:34:21	mvaenskae	zlg: ublock origin is a big reason i am staying with chromium
2016-01-21 12:34:39	mvaenskae	because it actually works decently well without too much of an overhead
2016-01-21 12:34:39	+zlg	mvaenskae: They have a Firefox build
2016-01-21 12:34:41	catpigger	need to reactivate my filter for insane german "news outlets", too lol
2016-01-21 12:35:03	djdunn	does anybody use fglrx with amdgpu?
2016-01-21 12:35:14	mvaenskae	no amd devices in this room
2016-01-21 12:35:21	mvaenskae	maybe a southbridge in my netbook
2016-01-21 12:35:34	catpigger	i dont think amdgpu supports my card
2016-01-21 12:35:37	+zlg	Honestly though the state of the Web is just bad. Firefox is becoming more like Chrome and they're going to gimp their extensions system.
2016-01-21 12:35:49	+zlg	The UI was changed to look like some ugly IE + Chrome hybrid...
2016-01-21 12:36:09	+zlg	srsly who puts the refresh button at the complete opposite side as the navigation?
2016-01-21 12:36:14	+zlg	(Microsoft does)
2016-01-21 12:36:18	catpigger	zlg, that reminds me, need to put making an iceweasel ebuild on my todo list
2016-01-21 12:36:29	+zlg	We don't have it in tree?
2016-01-21 12:36:36	+zlg	Wow.
2016-01-21 12:36:37	catpigger	(or adding a useflag to the firefox one)
2016-01-21 12:36:39	catpigger	i dont think so
2016-01-21 12:36:46	+zlg	Sure enough, not to be found in eix.
2016-01-21 12:37:01	catpigger	no hits on zugaina
2016-01-21 12:37:02	+zlg	I wonder if the pale moon devs have linux source.
2016-01-21 12:37:06	mvaenskae	iceweasel is some firefox fork, right?
2016-01-21 12:37:15	catpigger	mvaenskae, debian's, yep
2016-01-21 12:37:19	+zlg	iceweasel is Debian's firefox fork.
2016-01-21 12:37:25	+zlg	icecat is FSF's
2016-01-21 12:37:28	catpigger	tho fork is overstating it
2016-01-21 12:37:35	mvaenskae	what does it do differently?
2016-01-21 12:37:38	catpigger	it's more like go-oo.org
2016-01-21 12:37:50	+zlg	?
2016-01-21 12:38:08	catpigger	iceweasel is more a patchset on top of FF, not really a full fork
2016-01-21 12:38:11	+zlg	mvaenskae: Mostly just a removal of non-free things.
2016-01-21 12:38:28	mvaenskae	erm, why not use -bindist?
2016-01-21 12:38:30	+zlg	I believe icecat is more aggressive about it
2016-01-21 12:38:36	mvaenskae	or +bindist
2016-01-21 12:38:47	mvaenskae	cannot recall anymore what the flag enabled does
2016-01-21 12:38:50	catpigger	the original reason for iceweasel was that mozilla threatened debian as debian wanted to apply e.g. security patches without mozilla's approval, and by mozillas arguably insane trademark policy that is not permitted
2016-01-21 12:39:06	catpigger	well, not if you wanna call it firefox. so debian doesnt call it iceweasel anymore and everyone is happy.
2016-01-21 12:39:31	catpigger	by now i think debian also applies a few other patches
2016-01-21 12:39:58	+zlg	I can't imagine trying to patch a behemoth like Chrome or Firefox.
2016-01-21 12:40:02	catpigger	there is really no big difference
2016-01-21 12:40:04	catpigger	afaik
2016-01-21 12:40:05	+zlg	Browsers have become their own VMs really.
2016-01-21 12:40:33	+zlg	It doesn't help being written in C++ :P
2016-01-21 12:40:39	catpigger	zlg, at about 4.2 linux had 20M lines, firefox 19M
2016-01-21 12:40:43	catpigger	something like that
2016-01-21 12:40:50	catpigger	linux-4.2 and the then-current firefox
2016-01-21 12:40:57	+zlg	catpigger: That is nuts.
2016-01-21 12:41:04	+zlg	The kernel does so much more.
2016-01-21 12:41:10	catpigger	not something that iceweasel changes tho
2016-01-21 12:41:36	+zlg	I wonder what a browser would look like if it focused solely on the Web and the standards that relate to it.
2016-01-21 12:41:48	catpigger	firefox lol
2016-01-21 12:42:06	+zlg	Support for DRM and codecs is not what I'd call Web-oriented.
2016-01-21 12:42:07	 < 	djdunn (~djdunn@207.30.110.160) has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2016-01-21 12:42:09	catpigger	the web is no longer about browsing in the original sense
2016-01-21 12:42:38	+zlg	Yeah, the Web is trying to turn itself into a software platform using JS as the front-end language.
2016-01-21 12:42:58	catpigger	it is an app-runtime in every sensible definition of "app runtime" imho. i dont like it, but thats the way it is, and it's gonna get worse, not better
2016-01-21 12:43:12	catpigger	or if you like this: its gonna get better, not worse ;)
2016-01-21 12:43:24	+zlg	I wonder if anyone's going to fork HTTP and keep it simple.
2016-01-21 12:43:35	catpigger	http isnt the problem
2016-01-21 12:43:54	catpigger	well, i dont think http is great, but its not really related to the problem in discussion afaik
2016-01-21 12:43:59	catpigger	but then what do i know about web stuff
2016-01-21 12:44:03	+zlg	I blame Javascript and the XmlHttpRequest object.
2016-01-21 12:44:28	+zlg	Thanks, Obama^H^H^H^H^HMicrosoft.
2016-01-21 12:44:40	catpigger	we could switch to how RMS browses ^^
2016-01-21 12:44:49	+zlg	wget + email? haha
2016-01-21 12:44:55	fs0ciety	just use w3m. haha
2016-01-21 12:44:55	catpigger	he emails a server that fetches websites and then mails them to hi
2016-01-21 12:44:57	catpigger	him
2016-01-21 12:45:18	+zlg	That would get annoying pretty quickly.
2016-01-21 12:45:39	tomboy64	you guys forget that the kernel is essentially a bare-metal program. while ff is using gui in abundance.
2016-01-21 12:45:40	+zlg	It's probably extremely secure, though.
2016-01-21 12:45:50	fs0ciety	yeah i've read he does that, but then again his own website looks like it was built in 1995
2016-01-21 12:45:53	tomboy64	look at webkit, that thing is MASSIVE
2016-01-21 12:46:01	fs0ciety	tomboy64: webkit takes forever to compile
2016-01-21 12:46:05	catpigger	tomboy64, not forget, just conveniently didnt mention ;)
2016-01-21 12:46:08	+zlg	fs0ciety: I miss the old web, tbh.
2016-01-21 12:46:12	tomboy64	:p
2016-01-21 12:46:17	fs0ciety	zlg: i miss bbs's. i used to run one
2016-01-21 12:46:20	catpigger	fs0ciety, i love websites that look like they were built in 1995 :D
2016-01-21 12:46:29	catpigger	you should see the websites i made
2016-01-21 12:46:31	+zlg	The old web could use a freshening up with HTML5 and CSS3, then call it good.
2016-01-21 12:46:44	catpigger	hell, i still dont understand why everyone is hating on frames. frames were great
2016-01-21 12:46:46	+Griz64	i miss when WebAdmins created webpages that WERE also text based.
2016-01-21 12:46:47	+zlg	fs0ciety: I'm too young to have taken part in that, but I've read a bunch about them. Sounds awesome.
2016-01-21 12:46:47	tomboy64	unless you use meta-description for gui like qml for qt, everything gui is expensive to write and execute.
2016-01-21 12:47:09	fs0ciety	zlg: you can still access a ton via telnet
2016-01-21 12:47:11	catpigger	Griz64, by now i am satisfied if it is POSSIBLE to browse a website without JS
2016-01-21 12:47:19	+Griz64	*nod*
2016-01-21 12:47:21	+zlg	tomboy64: meta-description? Is that like a declarative syntax for a GUI grid?
2016-01-21 12:47:33	tomboy64	zlg: yeah
2016-01-21 12:47:36	+zlg	cool
2016-01-21 12:47:38	tomboy64	that i meant
2016-01-21 12:47:45	catpigger	stuff like "i have to scroll down 10 pages because the menu is fully expanded one below another" doesnt even register on my annoyadar (annoyance radar) anymore ^^
2016-01-21 12:48:03	+zlg	catpigger: Any site worth a **** has a "skip to content" link somewhere.
2016-01-21 12:48:28	+zlg	Well, mine doesn't iirc, but it doesn't need it. My navigation is like 7 items.
2016-01-21 12:48:41	catpigger	tomboy64, yep ofc. also FF has to parse roundabout 100 extremely complex formats and/languages (e.g. broken html in 10 versions, css, js, svg, ...)
2016-01-21 12:49:02	catpigger	in return the kernel has $deity knows how many drivers
2016-01-21 12:49:11	tomboy64	that's the next
2016-01-21 12:49:36	catpigger	given the current expected featureset from a browser its not surprising that it weighs in the same as the kernel
2016-01-21 12:49:41	+zlg	I liked the idea behind XHTML; break the damned site when HTML is malformed.
2016-01-21 12:49:44	+zlg	Force people to adhere to the standard.
2016-01-21 12:49:59	tomboy64	heh
2016-01-21 12:50:03	catpigger	but then am i switching to links? no.
2016-01-21 12:50:11	tomboy64	look at the gros of sites out there. no "strict" whatsoever
2016-01-21 12:50:18	catpigger	so i muddle along with a set of crippling extensions
2016-01-21 12:50:21	fs0ciety	w3m with w3m image buffer :)
2016-01-21 12:50:34	+zlg	catpigger: That's pretty much the only way to make the Web sane in its current form.
2016-01-21 12:50:34	catpigger	Griz64, actually, by now, i often run into websites that still dont work in my FF even if i whitelist everything in noscript
2016-01-21 12:50:43	+zlg	Disable as much as practical, use sanely-built websites.
2016-01-21 12:51:05	tomboy64	but then again, i absolutely adore websites that load their content modular and dynamical
2016-01-21 12:51:09	catpigger	so i open them in chrome, in significant part making the hassle i go through in FF pointless along the way..
2016-01-21 12:51:10	tomboy64	dynamic?
2016-01-21 12:51:17	+zlg	Stuff like this follows a cycle. I think eventually people will return to wanting simpler websites and better dedicated experiences on their phone or computer.
2016-01-21 12:51:28	catpigger	tomboy64, modularly and dynamically i would say
2016-01-21 12:51:39	tomboy64	sounds even uglier
2016-01-21 12:51:40	catpigger	zlg, they already did. look at the app markets
2016-01-21 12:51:54	+zlg	catpigger: Most apps are thinly wrapped browsers.
2016-01-21 12:52:10	catpigger	yeah. but they appear to the user as if they were native apps
2016-01-21 12:52:11	+zlg	But the ones that do proper apps, they're pretty great most of the time.
2016-01-21 12:52:34	+zlg	NewPipe on F-Droid is leagues better than Google's Youtube app, for example.
2016-01-21 12:52:47	+zlg	I can even play stuff in the background and turn my phone's screen off.
2016-01-21 12:52:53	catpigger	ah, i run youtube in the browser on my phone lol
2016-01-21 12:52:58	catpigger	oh wow
2016-01-21 12:53:19	catpigger	i've been abusing what i assume must be a bug to get youtube to keep playing tunes on screenlock
2016-01-21 12:53:27	+zlg	I have trouble sleeping, so it's really helpful to listen to something calm without worrying about my screen staying on.
2016-01-21 12:53:45	catpigger	ah yes sleeping, that reminds me of something
2016-01-21 12:54:00	*	catpigger takes a note to try newpipe
2016-01-21 12:54:38	+zlg	F-droid in general is pretty decent. OpenKeychain, k-9 mail, newpipe... there's probably more I haven't found yet.
2016-01-21 12:55:02	+zlg	Most of it's libre software, too.
2016-01-21 12:57:22	catpigger	yeah i try to get my crap from fdroid, too
2016-01-21 12:57:26	catpigger	transportr is pretty nice
2016-01-21 12:57:30	fs0ciety	zlg: I use F-Droid as well, been trying to run as a google free as possible on my handset
2016-01-21 12:58:07	catpigger	transportr is a free/libre public transport app i found in fdroid
2016-01-21 12:59:11	catpigger	and i dont think osmand needs mentioning. so i'll mention it anyways
2016-01-21 12:59:17	catpigger	and most importantly scummvm
2016-01-21 12:59:34	+zlg	osmand?
2016-01-21 12:59:42	catpigger	zlg, really?
2016-01-21 12:59:53	catpigger	maps&routing
2016-01-21 12:59:58	catpigger	using openstreetmap maps
2016-01-21 13:00:02	+zlg	fs0ciety: Same here. Unfortunately a few apps that I really like are only available on the Play store.
2016-01-21 13:00:09	+zlg	catpigger: oh, nice.
2016-01-21 13:00:31	catpigger	the UI is a little confusing to me, though i think recent versions are an improvement
2016-01-21 13:00:37	+zlg	fs0ciety: stuff like Solid Explorer, DualShock3 controller support, etc.
2016-01-21 13:00:37	catpigger	and it supports downloadable offline maps
2016-01-21 13:00:57	catpigger	dont care about data traffic, but not everwhere has perfect HSPA/LTE reception..
2016-01-21 13:01:26	+zlg	Offline maps sounds awesome.
2016-01-21 13:01:52	+zlg	I'm on a rather low data cap since I'm broke and/or cheap, but I'm almost always on wifi so I get nowhere near my cap.
2016-01-21 13:02:08	catpigger	yeah
2016-01-21 13:02:11	+zlg	I think I'm sitting at 300 MB used for the month and my cycle ends in a few days.
2016-01-21 13:02:12	catpigger	i switched to a cheaper network
2016-01-21 13:02:18	catpigger	now i get 2G for 13€
2016-01-21 13:02:33	+zlg	Nothing wrong with that.
2016-01-21 13:02:59	fs0ciety	zlg: unlimited here.. on average i download 4TB a month.. yeah im insane.. *looks around*
2016-01-21 13:03:00	+zlg	I mostly switched providers to get a new phone and to be able to use mobile hotspot on the rare occasion I want/need it.
2016-01-21 13:03:02	catpigger	crap network. but it's PAYG so if it bothers me too much i can still go back to vodafone or terrorkom
2016-01-21 13:03:05	+zlg	fs0ciety: hahaha
2016-01-21 13:03:15	catpigger	fs0ciety, on mobile/cellular? o.O
2016-01-21 13:03:16	+zlg	terrorkom?
2016-01-21 13:03:18	+zlg	lmao
2016-01-21 13:03:22	+zlg	That's an awesome name.
2016-01-21 13:03:26	fs0ciety	zlg: i just realised you were talking about cellular.. now thats a different story
2016-01-21 13:03:28	catpigger	zlg, oh sorry, typo. (deutsche/german) telekom
2016-01-21 13:03:39	+zlg	I like the typo better.
2016-01-21 13:03:47	fs0ciety	zlg: ive only got my work phone. on a business plan and its only 2.5gb
2016-01-21 13:04:28	+zlg	fs0ciety: I'm on a 1 GB plan. Traded in my phone to get half of my new phone's principle paid off, so I only pay $10.50/mo to pay my phone off.
2016-01-21 13:04:31	catpigger	yeah i only got a work phone, too
2016-01-21 13:04:36	+zlg	Not a bad deal and I upgraded by 2 generations.
2016-01-21 13:04:51	+zlg	My carrier is still evil, but if I can take advantage of something, I will :)
2016-01-21 13:05:02	catpigger	phone is bought cash though, so the 13€ is just for the 2G data
2016-01-21 13:05:23	fs0ciety	cheaper than AU. I'll tell you that :)
2016-01-21 13:05:39	+zlg	My plan + line access alone is $50 USD.
2016-01-21 13:06:14	catpigger	ouch
2016-01-21 13:06:15	+zlg	Throw in my monthly phone payment and insurance and I'm up to around $72.
2016-01-21 13:06:41	fs0ciety	my home 100mbit unlimited internet plan is $120 AU a month
2016-01-21 13:06:46	fs0ciety	and my phone is $80 AU a month
2016-01-21 13:06:52	+zlg	But I only paid taxes on the phone when I got it and monthly payments got docked by half.
2016-01-21 13:06:58	catpigger	yikes
2016-01-21 13:07:02	+zlg	So I'm actually in a pretty good spot for US service.
2016-01-21 13:07:12	fs0ciety	catpigger: yeah AU is expensive
2016-01-21 13:07:25	+zlg	I go through Xfinity (yay monopolies) and net access is $55/mo for me.
2016-01-21 13:07:38	+zlg	I think I'm on a 50/5 pipe
2016-01-21 13:07:42	 < 	DeafKids (~DeafKids@unaffiliated/frozenpigs) has quit (Quit: Kernel Panic)
2016-01-21 13:07:55	catpigger	well, to be fair, its a lot more expensive (as in, potential customers per unit area) to build a network in AU or US than DE
2016-01-21 13:07:55	+zlg	After a year it's going up $20, though.
2016-01-21 13:08:14	+zlg	What I'm kinda ticked about is having to pay $10 to rent the modem.
2016-01-21 13:08:22	+zlg	If I knew more about modems I'd just buy my own.
2016-01-21 13:08:36	catpigger	yeah my isp gave me a good fritzbox for free
2016-01-21 13:09:03	+zlg	This building is still coax, otherwise I'd just use my router.
2016-01-21 13:09:20	+zlg	c'est la vie I guess.
2016-01-21 13:10:34	catpigger	well, "free"
2016-01-21 13:11:12	+zlg	If it's free with service, then I'd say it's free since you need the device to use the service.
2016-01-21 13:11:25	+zlg	You're not being nickeled and dimed like me.
2016-01-21 13:11:31	catpigger	well i pay for it with my line rental and/or usage charges anyways
2016-01-21 13:11:48	catpigger	it's just bundled
2016-01-21 13:11:57	catpigger	and not separated on the bill
2016-01-21 13:12:06	+zlg	ah
2016-01-21 13:12:19	catpigger	its a for-profit company, they dont give stuff away
2016-01-21 13:12:56	catpigger	if they dont charge explicitly for the router and give you one anyways all that means is that the router cost is included/bundled with the other charges
2016-01-21 13:13:03	catpigger	tho 10$/mo is pretty obscene
2016-01-21 13:13:34	+zlg	Yeah, but that's Comcast for ya.
2016-01-21 13:13:37	catpigger	240$ for 2 years. depending on what you need that's enough for several routers
2016-01-21 13:13:59	+zlg	Well, I already have a router and the modem is in Bridge mode so my router handles all the real traffic.
2016-01-21 13:14:09	+zlg	I would just need to replace the modem in order to save $10/mo.
2016-01-21 13:14:19	+zlg	And I can't really do that until I get back to work :/
2016-01-21 13:16:21	catpigger	could try to get a second hand one ebay or craigslist
2016-01-21 13:16:38	+zlg	Oi, such general search terms make it hard to figure out if my supercard dstwo supports a monospace font in its text file viewer.
2016-01-21 13:16:39	catpigger	i wouldnt be surprised if you can get it for <30$ tbh
2016-01-21 13:17:04	+zlg	catpigger: I'd have to check that out once I land a job. In the meantime $10/mo hasn't been too bad, but I plan on fixing that.

2016-01-21 18:30:24	redcheckers	froller: cool.

2016-01-21 18:30:34	redcheckers	froller: btw what's the ccna stand for?
2016-01-21 18:30:39	redcheckers	froller: yes it is.
2016-01-21 18:30:52	redcheckers	froller: you're apparently stealing your own identity.
2016-01-21 18:31:02	+froller	indeed =)

2016-01-21 18:31:41	redcheckers	no its not
2016-01-21 18:31:44	redcheckers	its still thursday
2016-01-21 18:31:51	redcheckers	you have to wait 2 more days til the weekend :(
2016-01-21 18:31:59	jam3s2k1	well I don't have to go to work tomorrow, friday, or saturday
2016-01-21 18:32:14	redcheckers	and during those 2 days, the song 'lil bunny fufu hopping throo the forest picking up the field mice and bopping them on the head' will be stuck in YOUR head
2016-01-21 18:32:30	jam3s2k1	actually, it wont, but nice try
2016-01-21 18:32:32	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: ah. so not going to work = the weekend
2016-01-21 18:32:40	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, indeed :p
2016-01-21 18:32:42	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: yes, it will :) it might take a while to start, but it's in there.
2016-01-21 18:32:46	+froller	tomorrow's my only day i have to go to school
2016-01-21 18:32:57	+froller	what's the opposite of remote work or telecommuting?
2016-01-21 18:33:00	redcheckers	froller: too cool for school?
2016-01-21 18:33:11	redcheckers	froller: the opposite is going home for break/ vacation
2016-01-21 18:33:19	+froller	ungh =)
2016-01-21 18:33:20	redcheckers	froller: or 'homework'
2016-01-21 18:33:21	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, stuff like that was literally considered to be one of my weapons in the army. I've developed a mild immunity
2016-01-21 18:33:29	redcheckers	froller: the french word for homework, is apparently ' devoir'
2016-01-21 18:33:37	+froller	i mean the days i have to go to the actual school and can't just study at home
2016-01-21 18:33:48	jam3s2k1	froller, the opposite is called "traditional employment"
2016-01-21 18:33:50	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: having a tolerance, is not the same as being able to willfully forget something.
2016-01-21 18:34:04	redcheckers	froller: 'class hours'
2016-01-21 18:34:29	+froller	"class hours" sounds correctish
2016-01-21 18:35:13	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, I don't have to forget, but certain things just don't affect me anymore... it's like telling someone that they're not breathing manually or that their tongue exists
2016-01-21 18:36:14	jam3s2k1	hrm, IRC is really negatively affecting live tv streaming
2016-01-21 18:36:22	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: want to play a multi-user dungeon that froller mentioned the other day? i am almost level 40 already
2016-01-21 18:36:34	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: really? irs is low bandwidth?
2016-01-21 18:36:36	redcheckers	irc*
2016-01-21 18:36:38	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, not a big fan of MUDs these days
2016-01-21 18:36:45	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: why not>?
2016-01-21 18:36:50	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and it's pretty empty
2016-01-21 18:36:54	+froller	haha how much have you played redcheckers =))
2016-01-21 18:36:57	Tear	help, i'm starting to attempt to scroll in my browser with j/k
2016-01-21 18:37:00	redcheckers	8 players on, 13 max today
2016-01-21 18:37:07	redcheckers	froller: just for a few days now.
2016-01-21 18:37:17	+froller	what level was i on?
2016-01-21 18:37:28	redcheckers	froller: my char has a little over 22 hours on it ( after i tried the different race/class combos
2016-01-21 18:37:33	redcheckers	froller: you're level 61
2016-01-21 18:37:36	+froller	i played for maybe 3 months
2016-01-21 18:37:44	+froller	although i died a lot too =)
2016-01-21 18:37:53	redcheckers	froller: dying is bad for your level bro
2016-01-21 18:38:05	+froller	have you check out the big character's death histories?= =)
2016-01-21 18:38:10	+froller	they're funny
2016-01-21 18:38:17	redcheckers	froller: where is that?
2016-01-21 18:38:22	jam3s2k1	hrm, I'm actually starting to think the issue is related to the provider, not IRC... which sadly is where I work
2016-01-21 18:38:35	+froller	like "last killed august 4. 2001 by Satan"
2016-01-21 18:38:37	+froller	or some such
2016-01-21 18:38:39	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: ah. time to switch providers. maybe they are dpi'ing your irc because of the ssl
2016-01-21 18:38:46	+froller	i can't recall the command
2016-01-21 18:38:56	redcheckers	froller: well, since they're not logged on... i havent checked them no :P
2016-01-21 18:39:09	redcheckers	froller: why'd you pick gladiator anyways?
2016-01-21 18:39:11	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, I'm at home right now... but the audio is seriously out of sync with the video
2016-01-21 18:39:22	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: maybe it's just a poorly made production
2016-01-21 18:39:30	+froller	redchecker's, there's this one pretty cool area it has a quest too
2016-01-21 18:39:40	+froller	i can't remember the details and it's not for you just yet
2016-01-21 18:39:41	redcheckers	froller: lots of areas have quests.
2016-01-21 18:39:44	jam3s2k1	and since I my apartment wont let me install a dish, I can't check to see if it's us or the station
2016-01-21 18:39:49	+froller	but it's like a castle with fire drakes
2016-01-21 18:39:53	+froller	you kill them and take heir blood
2016-01-21 18:40:01	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: won't let you install a dish as a fixture ? you can get a little stand for them
2016-01-21 18:40:09	+froller	(this is not the quest i am talking about, you shall not talk quests)
2016-01-21 18:40:10	redcheckers	froller: oh like the deadlands?
2016-01-21 18:40:18	+froller	put the blood in bottles and make molotovs
2016-01-21 18:40:29	+froller	then it has tons of mermen and stuff
2016-01-21 18:40:35	redcheckers	froller: you know, the term molotov cocktail was created by the west, it wasn't what the original users actually called them
2016-01-21 18:40:41	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, no, it's a contractual issue. they have a contract with a 3rd party provider to install and maintain equipment, and the 3rd party has decided that they wont service our building
2016-01-21 18:40:51	+froller	"the west"?
2016-01-21 18:40:54	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: oh cool, that's a lot like what i experienced with cox cable
2016-01-21 18:40:58	redcheckers	froller: yeah. the west.
2016-01-21 18:41:03	redcheckers	its on the left hand side of the planet
2016-01-21 18:41:35	redcheckers	<---- left      right--->
2016-01-21 18:41:43	jam3s2k1	so I called my company up and told them "hey, they wont install our stuff" to which my company replied "their contract wont let us on your premises"
2016-01-21 18:42:01	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: respond ' can i do it myself, i'm certified?'
2016-01-21 18:42:14	+froller	i'm reading the history from wikipedia here
2016-01-21 18:42:29	+froller	says it was invented here =) ( i suppose "east")
2016-01-21 18:42:33	redcheckers	froller: wikipedia has lots of errors the further back they look.
2016-01-21 18:42:44	redcheckers	froller: they're better for contemporary topics.
2016-01-21 18:42:44	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, I can, and I know I can. the problem is that I can't afford a signal meter that's compatible with our new digital stream
2016-01-21 18:42:59	+froller	i mean, invented by the spanish but finns made adjustments
2016-01-21 18:43:03	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: pawn shop?
2016-01-21 18:43:13	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, controlled serialized inventory
2016-01-21 18:43:23	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and do you really have to afford it, can you buy it, and return it when it doesnt fit your needs?
2016-01-21 18:43:43	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: like how some older women will buy things at macys, go to an event, then return it  , etc
2016-01-21 18:44:12	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, loool, I could probably do that, but I'd still have to come up with the $750 to buy it so that I can return it
2016-01-21 18:44:25	+froller	this article has citations and even the name of the dude =)
2016-01-21 18:44:29	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: why not befriend someone who has one. company break room, put up a little ad?
2016-01-21 18:44:51	+froller	i'm of course talking about the finnish variant, which i think is the original "molotov cocktail"
2016-01-21 18:45:07	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, because we don't use them at my site. At my site, we use $50k spec-ans that are chained to carts
2016-01-21 18:45:24	redcheckers	froller:  if you want the first modern version, blame the french revolution.
2016-01-21 18:45:58	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: imagine if the lunch trays were chained to carts too :)
2016-01-21 18:46:07	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and you wheeled them to a chair to sit down and eat off of :)
2016-01-21 18:46:08	jam3s2k1	loool
2016-01-21 18:46:16	jam3s2k1	they better be made of gold
2016-01-21 18:46:30	redcheckers	nope... recycled materials 95%
2016-01-21 18:47:19	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but consider playing the mud later, with froller there, and you there, and me there, we could form a party, or even a guild with enough hours in
2016-01-21 18:47:45	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: you can wait til later, cause froller isnt there , even though he mentioned it the other day he hasnt logged on since may
2016-01-21 18:47:58	jam3s2k1	lol, let me finish all of the quests in fallout 4 and then get my nephew to level 40 in destiny, then I might consider it
2016-01-21 18:48:14	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: why not do both :) do fallout while you sleep/regen on the mud
2016-01-21 18:48:30	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: if you pick one of the dragons you'll do a lot of waiting for your blood to regen lol
2016-01-21 18:48:39	+froller	put the char on autoattack and follow
2016-01-21 18:48:45	+froller	and let us walk him thru areas =))
2016-01-21 18:48:49	jam3s2k1	lol
2016-01-21 18:49:00	redcheckers	froller: my character is on auto defend :P how do you put them on autoattack?
2016-01-21 18:49:13	+froller	can't recall
2016-01-21 18:49:18	+froller	isn't it a prty option
2016-01-21 18:49:26	redcheckers	froller: dunno.
2016-01-21 18:49:32	redcheckers	its not settable with toggle
2016-01-21 18:49:38	+froller	i mean if someone attacks your party, the chars attack the attacker
2016-01-21 18:49:42	redcheckers	there's autohp
2016-01-21 18:49:48	dugz	i'm making a simulated RAID-5 in my VM to learn its tricks!
2016-01-21 18:50:01	redcheckers	froller: really? that sounds handy. i've been using autodefend like that, but normally you have to type assist player
2016-01-21 18:50:04	dugz	doesn't look too hard
2016-01-21 18:50:13	redcheckers	dugz: will it let you play a mud?

2016-01-21 18:51:24	*	redcheckers made a character that is tank-like, hehehehe.
2016-01-21 18:51:40	*	dugz sits down on a stump and refuses to look at redcheckers. [Roll vs Charisma]
2016-01-21 18:52:12	redcheckers	dugz: oh thats the really fun part, is the level up stats are automated, you can go down a level by dying or going into the hard coded special room for it
2016-01-21 18:52:21	redcheckers	dugz: but otherwise you could be stuck with a lame level up stat :)
2016-01-21 18:52:39	redcheckers	dugz: and as a half-elf my charisma modifier is too high to need a roll :)

2016-01-21 19:00:09	redcheckers	dugz: the ~arch version of tinyfugue is better

2016-01-21 19:00:17	dugz	does it have ANSI color graphics?
2016-01-21 19:00:20	redcheckers	yep!
2016-01-21 19:00:22	+froller	i played with telnet though
2016-01-21 19:00:28	dugz	i might look into it
2016-01-21 19:00:32	+froller	makes you miss readline really quick
2016-01-21 19:00:34	redcheckers	froller: you're not paranoid about telnet? :)

2016-01-21 19:03:25	+froller	or telnet =)
2016-01-21 19:03:56	redcheckers	froller: cool :) telnet used to have a reputation for some security vulns . but i dont remember why
2016-01-21 19:04:21	redcheckers	froller: and by used to, i mean, last time i remember using telnet was before geocities disappeared
2016-01-21 19:05:16	+froller	it's just an old protocol
2016-01-21 19:05:19	+froller	and plaintext
2016-01-21 19:05:30	+froller	but what do i care if someone sniffs my muddings =)
2016-01-21 19:05:34	+froller	or even intercepts them
2016-01-21 19:06:04	redcheckers	froller: they might get your password
2016-01-21 19:06:05	+froller	i doubt messing up my game in a game where there's 8 other players isn't very high in anybodys priorities =)

2016-01-21 19:16:03	redcheckers	they can never do a minotaur version of the 300 (spartans)
2016-01-21 19:16:18	redcheckers	leonidas the minotaur, takes off his helmet, because it made his head heavy
2016-01-21 19:16:19	+froller	haaargh, redcheckers, in city of new avalon (iirc) there's a brothel
2016-01-21 19:16:28	redcheckers	froller: there's one in armland too
2016-01-21 19:16:35	+froller	you can kill one of the workers (iirc) there and get this codpiece
2016-01-21 19:16:41	+froller	that works also as a weapon
2016-01-21 19:16:44	+froller	it's sort of spear shaped
2016-01-21 19:16:46	+eroen	o_0
2016-01-21 19:16:49	redcheckers	froller: thats the one in armland.
2016-01-21 19:16:50	+froller	and it penetrates the opponenets
2016-01-21 19:16:53	redcheckers	and the codpiece is a belt.

2016-01-21 19:18:30	redcheckers	dugz: lol it kicked you out?
2016-01-21 19:18:42	+froller	had to spend like an hour shouting at the com channels from someone to come get me =)
2016-01-21 19:18:47	dugz	connection closed or somesuch
2016-01-21 19:18:47	redcheckers	froller but kobolds get a racial identify ability

2016-01-21 19:36:40	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: oh. a hiatus.
2016-01-21 19:37:23	jam3s2k1	just until I can get my wife unaddicted from credit cards and buy my playstation back
2016-01-21 19:38:19	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: or if she gets enough cash back points from the cards
2016-01-21 19:38:32	jam3s2k1	none of the cards are cash back cards

2016-01-21 19:39:21	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: there's a few cash back cards available on the google credit cards compare site
2016-01-21 19:39:30	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: oh. you sliced them up?
2016-01-21 19:39:31	redcheckers	:(
2016-01-21 19:39:57	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: lately i've been opening up a new card every month so that i won't get a thin credit file / be a ghost every time i spend a half a year or more out of country
2016-01-21 19:40:04	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, yes, I sliced them up. I want to buy another house sometime this decade, and I'm going to need her as a qualified cosigner
2016-01-21 19:40:19	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: oic. you gonna leave the cards open and just not use them?
2016-01-21 19:40:19	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.
2016-01-21 19:40:33	jam3s2k1	yes, they will stay open to build history
2016-01-21 19:40:33	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: lol. is it?
2016-01-21 19:40:36	redcheckers	right.
2016-01-21 19:40:44	redcheckers	i apparently didnt have history while out of country.
2016-01-21 19:41:01	jam3s2k1	that really sucks, but you only need one or two cards for history, not a new one every month
2016-01-21 19:41:04	redcheckers	so now i have a bunch of cards open that i dont need to use.
2016-01-21 19:41:07	dugz	redcheckers, can your client up-arrow through command history?
2016-01-21 19:41:17	redcheckers	dugz: my client, no. most clients, yes
2016-01-21 19:41:33	dugz	my arrow keys don't seem to work :/
2016-01-21 19:41:40	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, that will actually hurt your credit in the long run. Even if you aren't using them, you create a risk by having too many
2016-01-21 19:42:11	jam3s2k1	or... you don't spend on them, and the companies close them for nonactivity
2016-01-21 19:42:34	jam3s2k1	so now you've got a metric ton of empty closed accounts on your credit history for the next 6.5 years
2016-01-21 19:42:38	+eroen	I used MUSHclient as my mud client when I last muded :)
2016-01-21 19:42:38	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: they told me as long as i spend on them once a year they stay open
2016-01-21 19:42:51	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and they stop reporting if you close with no balance.
2016-01-21 19:42:56	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: i asked these questions ^_^
2016-01-21 19:43:04	redcheckers	eroen: how very bloated :) lol
2016-01-21 19:43:06	jam3s2k1	right, they stop reporting, but they don't disappear
2016-01-21 19:43:24	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: well, the cards i closed before i left disappeared
2016-01-21 19:43:28	+eroen	redcheckers: it was nice, had macros and things. :)
2016-01-21 19:43:42	redcheckers	eroen: yeah ive used it.
2016-01-21 19:44:45	jam3s2k1	for instance, there's a card on my reports that closed in 2012... instead of reporting a balance, it just says "unknown" for every block of every month
2016-01-21 19:44:56	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: the funny thing is, the only card i'd really benefit from having, is one that has no foreign transaction fee
2016-01-21 19:45:11	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but, even the cards that say ' no foreign transaction fee' tend to 'fudge the numbers' on the conversion rate
2016-01-21 19:45:23	redcheckers	so i dont neccesarily get a better product.
2016-01-21 19:45:50	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: one of my banks ' card charges 1% foreign transaction fee for credit, and 3% for check/debit.

2016-01-21 19:46:34	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: yeah, my cards dont do that. one of the department store cards reports unknown, but its still open
2016-01-21 19:46:46	redcheckers	the closed ones dont even report a history :(
2016-01-21 19:46:57	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: i have the same problem with my student loans, they're not reporting.
2016-01-21 19:47:02	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, whatever works for you, I guess... my debit card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees and reimburses atm fees... so umm, makes no difference as long as Visa is accepted
2016-01-21 19:47:14	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: ooo i want one of those
2016-01-21 19:47:26	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: no transaction fee would be so awesome x.x
2016-01-21 19:47:42	redcheckers	i paid a few hundred bucks in transaction fees last time i went to europe for 6 months
2016-01-21 19:47:46	redcheckers	and it was not fun lol
2016-01-21 19:47:57	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, you might not want your student loans to report? they tend to hurt scores for the first couple years, or until a couple years after your deferment ends, depending on how you work it out
2016-01-21 19:48:16	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: well, my student loan servicer kept refusing to aknowledge the school's own deferrment paperwork
2016-01-21 19:48:25	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and the department of ed ombudsman reviewed it
2016-01-21 19:48:46	redcheckers	and then said you know what. since you're eligible for discharge, we're going to discharge the loans and the deferrment issue is moot.
2016-01-21 19:48:52	redcheckers	they actually wrote ' moot' in the summary
2016-01-21 19:49:10	jam3s2k1	that wouldn't show up on your credit then, as you probably never paid anything
2016-01-21 19:49:14	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but now they're being discharged, or have been discharged, etc, and nothing shows up.
2016-01-21 19:49:24	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but previously in deferrment they said paid as agreed
2016-01-21 19:49:28	redcheckers	which is ' payment history'
2016-01-21 19:49:54	jam3s2k1	right, but they've been discharged, which means that, from a credit standpoint, you never had an option to actually pay any real money
2016-01-21 19:50:03	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: maybe they've been discharged.

2016-01-21 19:50:10	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: its unclear.
2016-01-21 19:50:16	+wiktor_b	https://goo.gl/maps/sUKKF5YHU1N2
2016-01-21 19:50:19	jam3s2k1	having a deferred loan discharged doesn't estabilish responsibility
2016-01-21 19:50:31	+wiktor_b	see that pedestrian bridge? How can you drive into it‽
2016-01-21 19:50:33	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: the servicer still tries to send me collection letters.  and nobody sent me a 1099 yet
2016-01-21 19:51:09	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but the thing is. the computers don't care if its a discharge or if its a deferrment. they just look at dates it was open, months /cycles of payments, and good or bad closure
2016-01-21 19:51:15	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, then it was probably transferred, not discharged, and you're probably going to find yourself in a really bd place
2016-01-21 19:51:20	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and its the computers that determine credit scores and such.
2016-01-21 19:51:23	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: Presumably you would leave the carriageway towards the left, and use the assistance of the barrier to flip you into the correct ramming orientation.
2016-01-21 19:51:36	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: no. the email i got from the us department of education, a us government agency, said it was being discharged.
2016-01-21 19:51:44	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: the school financial aid office told me the same
2016-01-21 19:51:56	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but without a 1099, i cant make the irs happy :/
2016-01-21 19:52:03	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: that's precisely what some BMW driver did this morning, costing me 20 minutes of doing 3 mph.
2016-01-21 19:52:05	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, the finaid office has no say in any of that, just an fyi
2016-01-21 19:52:05	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: You could then go partially up the stairs and flip back over, ensuring you block the entire exit on that roundabout.
2016-01-21 19:52:15	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: you're wrong.
2016-01-21 19:52:20	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: They are nothing if not predictable.
2016-01-21 19:52:23	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: this loan was a perkins.
2016-01-21 19:52:32	jam3s2k1	redcheckers, I'm not wrong, and I've been sued for issues with a perkins loan
2016-01-21 19:53:00	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: ok maybe not that far, but still... Seeing the damage to the car made me wonder just how fast must've he been driving when leaving that roundabout
2016-01-21 19:53:00	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: but the perkins rules changed a few times. and in the time period for my loan, the issuing institution owns the loan until its transferred to the government by discharge
2016-01-21 19:53:21	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: Probably managed to accelerate to 60mph in the distance he had.
2016-01-21 19:53:26	jam3s2k1	because I was told it was deferred while I was on active duty military when it really wasn't, so when I got back to the states, I ended up settling it
2016-01-21 19:53:33	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and they tell me it's been transfered to the government.

2016-01-21 19:54:42	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: it was a BMW, after all
2016-01-21 19:55:06	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: its really inconvenient not being sent a 1099 though
2016-01-21 19:55:12	jam3s2k1	because I can assure you that perkins loans financers (especially US Bank) have ways to screw you so hard that you'll wish you never bothered with the
2016-01-21 19:55:22	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: probably didn't even use indicators when exiting the roundabout
2016-01-21 19:55:34	jam3s2k1	they have til feb 15 to get you the 1099
2016-01-21 19:55:35	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: That's an optional extra that not many select.
2016-01-21 19:56:18	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: perkins loans are through the private institution
2016-01-21 19:56:19	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: I used to want a BMW. Seeing the kind of people that drive them... I don't want to anymore.
2016-01-21 19:56:34	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: no way I'm getting associated with them.
2016-01-21 19:56:36	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: Mercedes drivers tend to obey more rules.
2016-01-21 19:56:39	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: and yeah the loan servicers were really mean and nasty when they heard about the discharge
2016-01-21 19:56:47	redcheckers	jam3s2k1: one was even a manager there.
2016-01-21 19:56:48	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: They also speed mind you, but tend to do it more... tidily.

2016-01-21 20:00:05	redcheckers	wiktor_b: it turns out they were driving over to the cia office off of dolly madison parkway. so i debated whether not to write a letter to their employer to pass to the owner of the vehicle with that plate.

2016-01-21 20:06:00	+eroen	Then a car passed (on the left, in car lane) blinking to the right apparently wanting to take an exit. The car stopped by the exit, and I was thinking "That's nice, even if it's not strictly necessary he is waiting for me to pass the exit"

2016-01-21 21:54:10	dugz	redcheckers, i figured that out

2016-01-21 21:54:22	dugz	why do they even have quit?
2016-01-21 21:54:29	redcheckers	dugz: legacy purposes
2016-01-21 21:54:42	redcheckers	and because if you have more than 5 disconnected characters, they get upset it seems.
2016-01-21 21:54:48	redcheckers	so in that case one of the 6 will use quit

2016-01-21 23:16:21	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: that includes knowing a lot about it. I know the radiator is still good enough but it won't last much longer, which is why I'll replace it before the weather gets warm.
2016-01-21 23:16:38	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: it has less problems than all of my coworkers' "modern" cars
2016-01-21 23:16:40	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: I thought you were replacing the car ;)
2016-01-21 23:17:18	+wiktor_b	what‽
2016-01-21 23:17:30	+wiktor_b	it's like replacing a dog or a family member
2016-01-21 23:17:48	+wiktor_b	your dog dies, and you get a new one. But you don't "replace" it.
2016-01-21 23:17:50	redcheckers	wiktor_b: 'waiter i don't like this one, bring me another' ?
2016-01-21 23:17:54	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: I know, I wouldn't replace my car on a whim. Hence my surprise.
2016-01-21 23:18:04	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: I'm replacing the radiator.
2016-01-21 23:18:12	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: That makes more sense.
2016-01-21 23:18:20	+wiktor_b	:)
2016-01-21 23:18:20	redcheckers	wiktor_b: are you gonna get a modern radiator with aluminum ?
2016-01-21 23:18:35	redcheckers	its not just cheaper to make, its 'better' too . hehehehehe
2016-01-21 23:18:38	+wiktor_b	redcheckers: no, I'll get whatever's cheap and in ok condition.
2016-01-21 23:18:42	redcheckers	oh.
2016-01-21 23:18:45	redcheckers	that's 'aluminum'
2016-01-21 23:18:50	+wiktor_b	redcheckers: so, maybe I'll get an aluminum one.
2016-01-21 23:18:59	+wiktor_b	but maybe I'll get something else.
2016-01-21 23:19:06	redcheckers	i love how some people from the uk pronounce al u mini um.
2016-01-21 23:19:13	redcheckers	instead of al-ooo-min-ummm
2016-01-21 23:19:24	+wiktor_b	redcheckers: that's how you pronounce it
2016-01-21 23:19:39	redcheckers	wiktor_b: yes. here in the states we use al-oo-min-ummm
2016-01-21 23:20:03	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: Slippery slope, you'll have to start misspelling colour & centre next. Don't do it.
2016-01-21 23:20:06	dugz	redcheckers, i agree al-you-mini-umm sounds funny to my ear
2016-01-21 23:20:40	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: I meant the former pronounciation
2016-01-21 23:20:52	dugz	we butcher it to more like loominum
2016-01-21 23:21:00	+wiktor_b	huh those radiators cost £15-40, so cheap
2016-01-21 23:21:19	redcheckers	wiktor_b: make sure to have a used radiator boiled first to check for leaks (steamy)
2016-01-21 23:21:52	+wiktor_b	redcheckers: seeing how cheap new ones are, I wouldn't get a used one
2016-01-21 23:22:45	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: I *am* thinking of getting a new car, but I'm not getting rid of my old one.

2016-01-22 00:12:11	arvut	what is your preferable windowsize for unbordered terminal emulator?
2016-01-22 00:12:25	+eroen	one half screen
2016-01-22 00:12:32	+eroen	preferably left half
2016-01-22 00:12:40	+Chiitoo	Same.  :S
2016-01-22 00:12:46	arvut	I find 61x16 to be very convenient
2016-01-22 00:13:01	+Chiitoo	Well a bit over half right now.  1000x1080 (Konsole).
2016-01-22 00:13:22	arvut	writing two indent C is maybe a problem, haven't tried yet
2016-01-22 00:13:45	arvut	so you stay in such big terminals all the time?
2016-01-22 00:14:11	+Chiitoo	Pretty much.  Often several tabs on it.
2016-01-22 00:14:25	arvut	I got stuck with the 80x25 size, then decided to change it
2016-01-22 00:14:27	+eroen	yes, all things are so verbose, hard to keep context when scrolling much in tiny windows
2016-01-22 00:14:29	arvut	I don't tab
2016-01-22 00:14:35	arvut	hence borderless
2016-01-22 00:14:54	arvut	I use 20 workspaces instead
2016-01-22 00:14:57	arvut	per activity

2016-01-22 00:15:12	arvut	Sasha - Xpander
2016-01-22 00:15:28	+Chiitoo	I never got comfy with workspaces.  I do have two, but I always use just one.  I want to see most of the things (or parts of them) at all times.
2016-01-22 00:15:44	arvut	I have 5x4 workspaces, x3 atm
2016-01-22 00:16:27	+Chainsaw	arvut: One sixth of the screen, which gives me 120x33 in each of my five tabs.
2016-01-22 00:17:11	+eroen	yay, big boat coming into port :)
2016-01-22 00:17:28	arvut	Chainsaw: why so wide when you keep it thin?
2016-01-22 00:17:53	+Chainsaw	arvut: More information that way.
2016-01-22 00:18:07	+Chainsaw	arvut: I dislike line wrapping in log files. I find it loses context.
2016-01-22 00:18:26	arvut	logs should fit nicely in 80x though
2016-01-22 00:18:33	+Chainsaw	arvut: Mine don't.
2016-01-22 00:18:36	arvut	oh
2016-01-22 00:19:01	+Chainsaw	arvut: Particularly Asterisk still wraps occasionally at 120, but not as much.
2016-01-22 00:19:52	+Chainsaw	arvut: Syslog has a lot of timestamp & process lead-in that also pushes lines well over 80 characters.
2016-01-22 00:19:56	redcheckers	eroen: in case you missed it, the news in the us is talking about norway deporting bicyclists who are refugees, to russia
2016-01-22 00:21:54	arvut	you're right, /var/log/messages wraps around 130 for me
2016-01-22 00:22:05	arvut	some long dbus line
2016-01-22 00:22:26	+Chainsaw	arvut: So 120ish, about 122 by 33 lines... just about perfect.
2016-01-22 00:22:29	arvut	actually, it does not wrap, that is just longest-line
2016-01-22 00:22:43	arvut	but I don't like that width
2016-01-22 00:23:00	arvut	its much nicer to have half that width
2016-01-22 00:23:25	+Chainsaw	arvut: But now we're discussing how it makes you feel, not what data you are perusing.
2016-01-22 00:23:27	arvut	so 65x19 maybe
2016-01-22 00:23:44	arvut	Chainsaw: yes, variable size for reading annoyingly big logs
2016-01-22 00:25:14	arvut	try 61x16 for irssi, borderless preferably
2016-01-22 00:25:38	+Chainsaw	arvut: I use Hexchat for IRC.
2016-01-22 00:26:10	+eroen	redcheckers: wait wat? They told us they cancelled that and got busses in stead!

2016-01-22 00:30:37	+Chainsaw	Chiitoo: Qt is still quite new, the plugin set will be smaller.

2016-01-22 01:13:48	redcheckers	eroen: so... if i drive a bicycle fully of immigrants, thats bad too? or just special vehicles like buses?

2016-01-22 01:14:28	redcheckers	Chiitoo: yeah. bicycles with more than one person are harder to pedal

2016-01-22 01:14:57	redcheckers	the ones that look like car tire air valves
2016-01-22 01:15:12	+eroen	redcheckers: just like with planes and ships, the bus/car/whatver driver/company is responsible for not bringing people without visas across the border. Afaik this is the same everywhere
2016-01-22 01:15:29	+eroen	except the russian border guards shoot pedestrians :/
2016-01-22 01:15:31	redcheckers	eroen: but many bicycles are single-occupant
2016-01-22 01:16:10	redcheckers	and buses usualy are not
2016-01-22 01:16:13	+eroen	yes, hence avoiding the issue of criminalizing a third-party driver

2016-01-22 01:39:30	gizmore	there are three sticky bits, i think... owner, group, all
2016-01-22 01:40:05	gizmore	owner sticky is setuid for owner... means a binary runs as uid from owner, when someone else runs it... but better read a real doc about that (i  am noob)
2016-01-22 01:40:28	gizmore	so the t means write protect... interesting :)
2016-01-22 01:40:47	+Chiitoo	Well in other words, it means only the owner of a file or directory under a sticky-bit can delete them.
2016-01-22 01:41:19	+Chiitoo	I believe there are some other ways for it to be used in Unix, but that's how it's used on Linux.

2016-01-22 03:06:25	dugz	iamben, i'm trying to use mdadm in my genkernel initramfs
2016-01-22 03:06:35	+iamben	dugz: i know.
2016-01-22 03:06:38	+hosler	every time i say i use gentoo on a public forum people call me a nerd and tell me how much gentoo sucks :(
2016-01-22 03:06:44	dugz	iamben, no
2016-01-22 03:06:45	+eroen	:(
2016-01-22 03:06:59	dugz	iamben, i'll try it
2016-01-22 03:07:12	+iamben	dugz: you enable it at build time in genkernel.conf or --mdadm, but you must activate it at boot time with the kernel param too
2016-01-22 03:07:25	dugz	! maybe thats it
2016-01-22 03:07:26	+hosler	can someone toss me some sound justification for using gentoo that i can copy and paste?
2016-01-22 03:07:32	bluearc	hosler:  Try not to look too pleased when those ppl's computers crash ....
2016-01-22 03:07:35	+iamben	--mdadm just tells it to make an mdadm CAPABLE initramfs, it doesn't activate the mdadm init code
2016-01-22 03:08:08	+hosler	bluearc: this is in a linux thread. so these guys use ubuntu and centos and stuff
2016-01-22 03:09:23	+eroen	hosler: gentoo is rice^W choice
2016-01-22 03:09:58	bluearc	hosler:  Those will crash, too ..... unless they know what's going on under the hood.   And if they did, they'd use gentoo!
2016-01-22 03:09:59	+eroen	hosler: y u no just link to funroll-loops.info
2016-01-22 03:10:24	dugz	iamben, adding domdadm to the kernel line fixed my raid :D

2016-01-22 04:05:58	catpiggest	wiktor_b, yeah, i couldnt find easy step-by-step instructions, but since they say you have to flash externally i'd imagine it's simply setting up the flashing (for which they do link instructions) and then writing the file

2016-01-22 04:13:02	catpiggest	has anyone here done that?
2016-01-22 04:13:06	catpiggest	Smiley, was just thinking that lol
2016-01-22 04:13:13	Smiley	catpiggest: i expect it's very difficult
2016-01-22 04:13:18	Smiley	due to boards being all over the place
2016-01-22 04:13:24	catpiggest	i assume its very difficult to do this
2016-01-22 04:13:24	Smiley	else, surely they'd have more than a few done?
2016-01-22 04:13:31	catpiggest	yeah that..
2016-01-22 04:13:37	Smiley	and if you screw up...
2016-01-22 04:13:46	catpiggest	maybe coreboot has docs on this
2016-01-22 04:13:53	audiodef	Anyone have any cron daemon recommendations for a hardened server?
2016-01-22 04:14:06	catpiggest	well, maybe its really hard to physically damage the board?
2016-01-22 04:14:16	Smiley	catpiggest: i'd doubt that too
2016-01-22 04:14:20	catpiggest	yeah me too
2016-01-22 04:14:35	Smiley	concidering most bios's etc these days control voltages and the like
2016-01-22 04:14:39	Smiley	you could easily make a mess
2016-01-22 04:14:58	Smiley	all conjunctor of course
2016-01-22 04:15:26	catpiggest	ah, coreboot does have docs on this
2016-01-22 04:16:02	+wiktor_b	catpiggest: very difficult if you don't have hardware dox
2016-01-22 04:16:07	catpiggest	"Supporting a new board can take from an hour to over a year of time."
2016-01-22 04:16:17	catpiggest	well, at least i know a range... ;)
2016-01-22 04:16:35	catpiggest	wiktor_b, i could write asus and ask them to send me some :D
2016-01-22 04:18:12	catpiggest	hm if they already support a new board with same cpu family, chipset and superio it's merely "This can take from an hour of time to a few months based upon your coding skills and hardware issues."
2016-01-22 04:19:17	catpiggest	wow, AMD has been giving specs and even patches to coreboot. did not expect that
2016-01-22 04:21:41	+wiktor_b	yeah AMD has been doing all right with that stuff
2016-01-22 04:21:52	+wiktor_b	AMD is actually quite good at doing open sauce
2016-01-22 04:21:56	catpiggest	first radeon, now this

2016-01-22 04:22:33	catpiggest	zen is their next x86 right?
2016-01-22 04:22:38	+wiktor_b	yes

2016-01-22 04:27:17	+FrostFeline	besides "open sauce" I mean.
2016-01-22 04:27:27	+chithead	intel does not support all chips. mostly atoms with powervr graphics are unsupported by their open drivers

2016-01-22 04:28:10	+iamben	chithead: well they have drivers for all intel chips, but yes it's a shame they used a nasty powervr chip on those atoms
2016-01-22 04:28:36	+chithead	intel sells them, so intel must accept responsibility for them

2016-01-22 04:34:09	+wiktor_b	so writing custom software == breaking warranty is a meme hardware manufacturers want you to believe

2016-01-22 04:39:34	AsumFace	when talking about warranty, what warranty is generally meant? the 2 year required-by-law (EU) warranty or the voluntary-by-manufacturer-or-seller warranty?

2016-01-22 04:41:48	catpiggest	AsumFace, i mean the legally required one
2016-01-22 04:41:51	catpiggest	*meant
2016-01-22 04:42:18	catpiggest	the voluntary one i cant comment on, but i am quite certain that under german law you do not void your legal warranty by replacing the OS on your phone
2016-01-22 04:43:50	AsumFace	you can even disassemble electronics without automatically voiding it
2016-01-22 04:46:11	catpiggest	yep
2016-01-22 04:46:47	catpiggest	there's a case in federal court in germany against a company that tried to refuse warranty for someone who did a hw upgrade on their computer
2016-01-22 04:47:12	catpiggest	tho that's a fair bit different as the court held that doing hw upgrades is normal usage and therefore cannot be excluded
2016-01-22 04:48:21	catpiggest	but getting coreboot onto my board might actually be fairly straightforward

2016-01-22 05:35:20	cnnx	but i found myself looking at the crack
2016-01-22 05:35:21	torindel	and pivot it so you see it in front
2016-01-22 05:35:40	cnnx	both
2016-01-22 05:35:57	cnnx	one has to be center all the time
2016-01-22 05:35:59	cnnx	the biggest one
2016-01-22 05:36:13	cnnx	then the side angled
2016-01-22 05:36:17	cnnx	right?
2016-01-22 05:36:47	torindel	depends on preferences, i prefer "semi circle" with monitors horizontal

2016-01-22 05:49:29	dugz	would xf86-video-modesetting work with the EFI framebuffer?
2016-01-22 05:51:20	torindel	dugz: did efi framebuffer export /dev/dri/card0?
2016-01-22 05:51:31	torindel	dugz: if yes then yep it will work
2016-01-22 05:52:16	dugz	torindel, its there, yellow on black
2016-01-22 05:52:29	dugz	not sure what that means
2016-01-22 05:52:37	torindel	dugz: then you should be fine
2016-01-22 05:53:02	torindel	"yellow on black" with colored ls means device file
2016-01-22 05:53:08	dugz	torindel, cool, this virtualbox driver is too buggy
2016-01-22 05:53:39	torindel	youre using efi in virtualbox? -.-
2016-01-22 05:53:52	torindel	you know its buggy probably because of that? xd
2016-01-22 05:53:53	dugz	torindel, yeah, its a learning project
2016-01-22 05:54:24	torindel	as efi support in virtualbox is incomplete, highly experimental and buggy? ^^
2016-01-22 05:54:41	torindel	unless something changed and i dont know about it
2016-01-22 05:54:47	dugz	torindel, puppy linux works fine in EFI mode, but my gentoo won't go back to console from X
2016-01-22 05:55:27	dugz	torindel, i have the EFI stuff all working, afaik
2016-01-22 05:56:16	torindel	dugz: last i tryied it with efi enabled freebsd bootloader loaded kernel for 5mins, after it finally booted it ended in kernel panic ^^
2016-01-22 05:56:38	torindel	that about sums it how well virtualbox got efi support
2016-01-22 05:56:42	dugz	it seems stable from my experience, was a real pain to setup
2016-01-22 05:58:30	Smiley	anyone wanna collect this 24port switch??
2016-01-22 05:59:46	dugz	huh? xf86-video-modesetting exists in portage but there is no VIDEO_CARDS flag for modesetting
2016-01-22 06:00:31	torindel	dugz: and note that on ~arch modesetting is built in in xorg-server
2016-01-22 06:00:38	torindel	dunno about stable one
2016-01-22 06:00:49	dugz	maybe it is
2016-01-22 06:01:47	torindel	Smiley: another stand for flower?

2016-01-22 06:10:50	torindel	wiktor_b: it was not, it was just integrated into xorg-server as non-optional ^^
2016-01-22 06:11:20	Smiley	Viperlin: proposed date for hosue move is 3rd feb :O
2016-01-22 06:11:41	dugz	either way, i can't access the text consoles in vbox once i start x, they are blank but functioning. i can type blindly and do things
2016-01-22 06:12:07	torindel	dugz: with modesetting driver?
2016-01-22 06:12:12	torindel	or virtualbox one?
2016-01-22 06:12:30	dugz	torindel, i tried virtualbox, modesetting, and fbdev

2016-01-22 06:14:18	dugz	torindel, the whole point of my exercise is to make a functioning EFI system to learn how it works
2016-01-22 06:14:30	+zlg	"What's your home address?" "127.0.0.1" "No, your physical address." "BC:AE:C5:BC:DF:82"

2016-01-22 06:15:04	+zlg	Smiley: Same, pretty funny stuff.
2016-01-22 06:15:22	+zlg	You could replace the first one with ::1 and be just as correct.
2016-01-22 06:15:51	torindel	dugz: not much to learn really ^^
2016-01-22 06:16:23	dugz	torindel, after two days of tinkering i learned a lot
2016-01-22 06:16:45	torindel	dugz: biggest differences are that efi bios doesnt initialize all hardware (might cause new bugs) and non-bootsector based booting
2016-01-22 06:16:50	dugz	i'm using rEFInd instead of Grub2
2016-01-22 06:17:10	torindel	dugz: i usually still use grub2 on efisystems

2016-01-22 06:18:50	dugz	um yeah.. piece of cake
2016-01-22 06:19:01	Viperlin	Smiley: do you want to do my job at a severely low rate of pay
2016-01-22 06:19:25	Viperlin	i call it "insourcing"
2016-01-22 06:19:49	torindel	dugz: not that hard if you wrote config for any bootloader earlier (i.e. grub1/whatever) and it will be 4 times smaller than grub-mkconfig generated one ^^
2016-01-22 06:20:44	dugz	torindel, i fooled with Grub2 briefly, decided i didn't care for it, and learned how to replace it with SYSLINUX
2016-01-22 06:20:51	Smiley	Viperlin: depending how low that pay is, maybe XD

2016-01-22 06:23:44	dugz	thats not bad torindel, so its possible to disable the grub-mkconfig?
2016-01-22 06:23:57	torindel	dugz: you dont need to use it at all
2016-01-22 06:24:26	torindel	grub-install doesnt invoke it by itself, and you can make grub.cfg yourself instead of autogenerating it with grub-mkconfig
2016-01-22 06:24:38	dugz	i don't want the OS managing my boot sector and overwriting things is my only peeve
2016-01-22 06:25:01	+iamben	dugz: you misunderstand grub.
2016-01-22 06:25:06	torindel	and on efi you dont even have bootsector anymore ^^
2016-01-22 06:25:17	dugz	you know what i mean
2016-01-22 06:25:50	+iamben	you dont have to "disable grub2-mkconfig", you just dont run it.
2016-01-22 06:26:12	dugz	its ok iamben i'm competent with SYSLINUX and now rEFInd
2016-01-22 06:26:18	+iamben	even if you do run it, it modifies the runtime config, not the bootloader stage code
2016-01-22 06:26:48	dugz	syslinux is kinda nice actually, it can have a nice menu too
2016-01-22 06:27:17	+iamben	those are fine bootloaders but i feel you are avoiding grub just because of misinformation and fear
2016-01-22 06:27:37	dugz	iamben, probably fear :D
2016-01-22 06:27:38	+iamben	because "omg it's automatic i can't control it!"
2016-01-22 06:27:43	dugz	yep
2016-01-22 06:27:46	torindel	yea, and like i said if you dont like grub-mkconfig write minimal one yourself ^^
2016-01-22 06:27:46	+hosler	iamben: thats how i feel about ubuntu

2016-01-22 06:29:43	dugz	i really like Grub 0.97
2016-01-22 06:29:49	+zlg	dugz: Same.
2016-01-22 06:29:53	+zlg	Simple, works.
2016-01-22 06:30:02	+iamben	as torindel said, grub2 CAN be configured just as easily manually as grub legacy
2016-01-22 06:30:11	+zlg	I've used lilo before too, and it's pretty nice from what little I used it.
2016-01-22 06:30:11	+iamben	but an autoconfig is provided which works very well for the vast majority of users
2016-01-22 06:30:13	dugz	iamben, i'll check it out
2016-01-22 06:30:19	+zlg	Never tried to get Windows to boot through lilo, though.
2016-01-22 06:30:37	torindel	dugz: only difference between grub2 and grub1 is that they added more tools (i.e. grub-mkconfig) and made it more modular
2016-01-22 06:30:41	+iamben	and the autoconfig is nothing to fear either, it works predictably and reliably, and it is not some black box, it's a shell script which finds & lists kernels
2016-01-22 06:30:42	dugz	iamben, i don't like a boot menu with 3 pages of kernels listed lol
2016-01-22 06:30:57	+iamben	dugz: by default, all but the latest get tucked into an advanced menu
2016-01-22 06:31:00	+iamben	this is configurable, of course
2016-01-22 06:31:04	torindel	zlg: with lilo you chainloaded windows like any other bootloader
2016-01-22 06:31:09	+zlg	torindel: cool.
2016-01-22 06:31:19	torindel	zlg: or remaped drives if needed
2016-01-22 06:31:31	+zlg	Yeah, Windows is pretty greedy about the MBR.
2016-01-22 06:33:03	torindel	dugz: make your own grub.cfg that points to /boot/vmlinuz, make correct symlinks in /boot (/boot/System.map, /boot/config, /boot/vmlinuz) and make install in /usr/src/linux will update them for you - no need to touch grub.cfg ever again
2016-01-22 06:34:11	dugz	torindel, can't symlink on /boot because its the vfat EFI System partition
2016-01-22 06:34:12	+hosler	why on earth
2016-01-22 06:34:25	+iamben	dugz: you can just have vmlinuz be a copy in that case
2016-01-22 06:34:43	+iamben	you waste 10MB disk space or so
2016-01-22 06:34:49	dugz	iamben, i just bump the revision numbers in the config file
2016-01-22 06:35:04	+iamben	well we're just telling one low-maintenance way to do it
2016-01-22 06:35:14	+iamben	just using grub2-mkconfig is easiest, really
2016-01-22 06:35:18	dugz	i know its how i used to do it with grub 0.97
2016-01-22 06:35:20	torindel	dugz: also note you can keep /boot on /, just keep grub in efi system partition
2016-01-22 06:35:22	+hosler	grub2-mkconfig is amazing
2016-01-22 06:35:58	torindel	hosler: convince him to use grub-mkconfig after he is convinced to use grub2 ^^

2016-01-22 06:40:29	+iamben	various other comments suggesting that an autoconfig script means there is no control over what happens, and results are totally unpredictable
2016-01-22 06:41:32	dugz	iamben, i just remember trying to work with all the meta config files and it was driving me bonkers for some reason
2016-01-22 06:42:08	dugz	i wasn't aware that humans could create the file manually
2016-01-22 06:42:21	+hosler	you can, but it's much more complicated
2016-01-22 06:42:24	+iamben	if you come from a more manual-config bootloader like grub legacy or lilo, you may overthink some parts of grub2's autoconfig
2016-01-22 06:42:28	+zlg	iamben: I often feel like counting on automatic scripts takes control away from me. If it's a bash script like you said, though, it's easy enough to just read it and see what it does.
2016-01-22 06:42:30	+iamben	hosler: no, it's not.
2016-01-22 06:42:36	+hosler	iamben: manual config is for sure
2016-01-22 06:42:40	+hosler	i have no idea what im looking at
2016-01-22 06:43:06	+hosler	it's antimidating
2016-01-22 06:43:10	+iamben	hosler: if you take a full-featured autogenerated config, it looks complex.  but if you hand-write from zero (like grub legacy) it is not more complex
2016-01-22 06:43:18	+zlg	One of the benefits of libre software is the ability to examine what something does.
2016-01-22 06:43:20	+hosler	oh
2016-01-22 06:43:33	+iamben	the autoconfigured script has bits to intelligently find disks if they move around, and such
2016-01-22 06:44:03	+iamben	you CAN write a dumb old 3-liner static config just like always.  i dont mean dumb in a bad way, in a simple way
2016-01-22 06:44:18	dugz	the whole autogeneration gave me nightmares about being back on debian :D
2016-01-22 06:45:25	dugz	debian autogenerates their autogenerators
2016-01-22 06:45:35	+iamben	to move from grub legacy to grub2, you have to use "linux" instead of "kernel" in the config, and partition numbering starts at 1 rather than 0.  that's what changed.
2016-01-22 06:45:51	+hosler	wow
2016-01-22 06:45:59	+hosler	who starts counting from 1 seriously
2016-01-22 06:46:05	+zlg	non-zero indexing?
2016-01-22 06:46:11	+zlg	What sort of brain damage is that? :P
2016-01-22 06:46:12	+iamben	all partition tools ever
2016-01-22 06:46:15	+zlg	Lua?
2016-01-22 06:46:29	+hosler	iamben: except grub
2016-01-22 06:46:32	+zlg	Yeah, in the context of partitions it makes sense.
2016-01-22 06:46:41	+zlg	We don't have /dev/sda0
2016-01-22 06:46:47	dugz	lol
2016-01-22 06:46:54	+hosler	oh partitions
2016-01-22 06:47:05	+iamben	in any case, that change just makes the config slightly DIFFERENT, not more complex
2016-01-22 06:47:24	+zlg	iamben: So I can take my existing config, make those tiny changes, and it'll work on GRUB2?
2016-01-22 06:47:37	+iamben	zlg: oh and rename to grub.cfg of course, but yes
2016-01-22 06:47:54	+hosler	then why on earth am i using grub2-mkconfig
2016-01-22 06:48:02	+hosler	it makes things too easy
2016-01-22 06:48:08	+iamben	i still personally thing grub2-mkconfig is the better choice for most cases
2016-01-22 06:48:08	dugz	cus youre a debian sissyboy
2016-01-22 06:48:14	+zlg	hosler: I think you just answered yourself.
2016-01-22 06:48:26	+zlg	Get with the program and write your own kernel/grub updater, newb!
2016-01-22 06:48:32	*	zlg is kidding.
2016-01-22 06:48:51	+iamben	if you were to look at #gentoo logs from >5 years ago (pre-grub2 stable) compared to today, i think you'd see at least 10x more problems
2016-01-22 06:48:58	+zlg	I've never been fond of tools that think they know better than I do.
2016-01-22 06:49:05	+iamben	remember "root (hd0,0)"  "setup (hd0)"?
2016-01-22 06:49:28	+zlg	Yeah, I remember a lot of issues surrounding grub2 when it first became a thing.
2016-01-22 06:49:39	+zlg	It scared me away from it. I tried using it with my latest Gentoo install and it hated me.
2016-01-22 06:49:46	+iamben	oh if your /dev/sdb is actually disk 0 according to bios, things will explode

2016-01-22 06:51:59	+Cheaterman	why more, why less? Gentoo's the best!
2016-01-22 06:52:20	+zlg	I love me some Gentoo but I'm not sure it's the best for production. Depends on your needs.
2016-01-22 06:52:28	+Cheaterman	What production do you do
2016-01-22 06:52:36	+Cheaterman	I'm speaking about digital retail furniture
2016-01-22 06:52:50	+zlg	I produce ramblings.

2016-01-22 06:52:54	+zlg	So my VPS on Gentoo works just fine

2016-01-22 06:53:39	+zlg	Honestly I've been spoiled by Gentoo. I'm very picky on how I like systems to be.
2016-01-22 06:53:53	+Cheaterman	That's something I understand
2016-01-22 06:53:55	+zlg	Gentoo didn't call me; my compulsions led me here. :)
2016-01-22 06:53:59	+Cheaterman	But on the other hand I don't spend time on my VPS
2016-01-22 06:54:02	+Cheaterman	Just using it :)
2016-01-22 06:54:05	+zlg	Ah, true.
2016-01-22 06:54:09	AwoL	Gentoo has spoiled us all - but I do agree that it depends on your needs (i.e., commercial software will likely be easier to use on RHEL)

2016-01-22 06:54:19	+Cheaterman	AwoL: We do the software

2016-01-22 06:54:39	+zlg	I should really reinstall on my VPS or something.
2016-01-22 06:54:43	+Cheaterman	You have to realize our previous production OS was Lubuntu

2016-01-22 06:55:22	+zlg	dugz: True. I'd never recommend to a newbie.
2016-01-22 06:55:29	+zlg	Gentoo is for people who know what they want.
2016-01-22 06:55:46	+zlg	Or aren't afraid to break everything learning what they want :P
2016-01-22 06:55:46	+Cheaterman	All of GNU/Linux pretty much
2016-01-22 06:55:55	dugz	i've been running gentoo since about 2004
2016-01-22 06:56:00	+zlg	2012 here.
2016-01-22 06:56:06	+Cheaterman	2008-ish here
2016-01-22 06:56:18	+zlg	I got started on Mandrake/Debian/Ubuntu around 2005, Arch in 2007, Gentoo 2012.
2016-01-22 06:56:48	+Cheaterman	So much time lost on Arch
2016-01-22 06:56:49	+Cheaterman	poor you
2016-01-22 06:56:52	+zlg	I honestly should've come to Gentoo sooner
2016-01-22 06:56:56	+Cheaterman	Must feel like discovering Python after 10 years of compiled languages
2016-01-22 06:56:59	+Cheaterman	(which I personally did)
2016-01-22 06:57:20	+Cheaterman	(I love Python, and I feel like I wasted loads of time :p)
2016-01-22 06:57:24	Tear	i spent a good few years on arch, before it got system'd
2016-01-22 06:57:24	+zlg	I started with PHP around 2003-2004, didn't discover Python until 2008 or so.
2016-01-22 06:57:27	Tear	what's so bad about it?
2016-01-22 06:57:34	+Cheaterman	Tear: The mains.
2016-01-22 06:57:35	+zlg	Tear: Culture, mostly.
2016-01-22 06:57:37	+Cheaterman	maints*
2016-01-22 06:57:44	dugz	yeah python for the win!
2016-01-22 06:57:46	+Cheaterman	They take drugs that I wouldn't recommend
2016-01-22 06:57:52	+Cheaterman	And you know me, I'm pretty open minded
2016-01-22 06:58:03	+zlg	Arch devs generally just drink the Red Hat kool aid.
2016-01-22 06:58:11	Tear	wow, no love for ruby
2016-01-22 06:58:12	+Cheaterman	Like, gogo booze (but reasonably), gogo THC
2016-01-22 06:58:14	+Cheaterman	But yeah
2016-01-22 06:58:28	+Cheaterman	They also take RedHatcaïne
2016-01-22 06:58:31	+zlg	Ruby is a strange beast.
2016-01-22 06:58:34	+Cheaterman	And that's some heavy powder
2016-01-22 06:58:52	+Cheaterman	Tear: Absolutely none, really :)
2016-01-22 06:59:00	+Cheaterman	No hate either
2016-01-22 06:59:04	+zlg	The first sign that I should've left Arch is I wanted to have Vim without Ruby support since I never used Ruby.
2016-01-22 06:59:06	+Cheaterman	But ruby makes me absolutely neutral
2016-01-22 06:59:11	+Cheaterman	even more than node.js, that I rather dislike
2016-01-22 06:59:15	+Cheaterman	But still kinda neutral

2016-01-22 07:00:20	+zlg	JS has next to no typing, crazy truth tables, no integers... and people write *server software* with it?

2016-01-22 07:00:45	+Cheaterman	like wtf, and they expect any reliability?

2016-01-22 07:01:16	+Cheaterman	One distro to rule them all
2016-01-22 07:01:17	+zlg	Ubuntu is the alpha, Gentoo is the omega.
2016-01-22 07:02:14	+Cheaterman	But yeah that all-in-one deployment script is an achievement I'm pretty proud of
2016-01-22 07:02:14	jerichowasahoax	i just like not having to have both KDE and GNOME installed just to have Qt and GTK work, respectively
2016-01-22 07:02:19	+Cheaterman	unattended Gentoo setup script pretty much
2016-01-22 07:02:26	Tear	i guess i'm not alone, since i recently discovered a complete rewrite of flash api and all well liked libraries (flashpunk, flixel) in haxe
2016-01-22 07:05:53	+Cheaterman	I just kinda love Python. The more I use it the more I love it
2016-01-22 07:05:58	+zlg	Cheaterman: Sounds awesome. Got a Gist or paste of it?
2016-01-22 07:06:09	Tear	i tried haxe years ago, its documentation was incomplete and outdated, and most tutorial code didn't work because they made backwards-incompatible syntax changes to the language in minor versions
2016-01-22 07:06:10	+Cheaterman	zlg: Err, as I said yesterday, it's company stuff, so kinda closed source
2016-01-22 07:06:15	+zlg	I really should write more Python, but I'm still working on the K&R and want to have a good foundation of C.

2016-01-22 07:08:42	+Cheaterman	;-)
2016-01-22 07:08:52	+zlg	I don't even think that's right.
2016-01-22 07:09:02	+Cheaterman	I believe so, and it's often the case
2016-01-22 07:09:04	+Cheaterman	I'd say 80% of times
2016-01-22 07:09:05	+zlg	The "right way" is completely dependent on circumstances.

2016-01-22 07:10:37	+Cheaterman	Yes.
2016-01-22 07:10:40	+Cheaterman	^I is incorrect.
2016-01-22 07:10:42	+Cheaterman	;-)
2016-01-22 07:10:59	+Cheaterman	if you're working with other people, good chances are they indent with tabs

2016-01-22 07:11:02	+zlg	No argument I've read on spaces > tabs has made good sense.
2016-01-22 07:11:06	+Cheaterman	so ^I is incorect

2016-01-22 07:11:47	+Cheaterman	this is how I like to go about choosing how to work
2016-01-22 07:12:02	+Cheaterman	in order, i'll adapt to what people currently do

2016-01-22 07:12:14	+iamben	you guys sure are typing out a lot of words to say very little
2016-01-22 07:12:27	+hosler	tabs r good

2016-01-22 07:12:57	+hosler	nano
2016-01-22 07:12:59	+zlg	Not much of a flamewar.
2016-01-22 07:13:02	+Cheaterman	ed
2016-01-22 07:13:06	+zlg	emacs is a nice OS, vim is a great editor.
2016-01-22 07:13:07	+hosler	sed
2016-01-22 07:13:14	+Cheaterman	emacs is a nice OS with a bad editor

2016-01-22 07:13:31	+zlg	Apparently nano has syntax highlighting.
2016-01-22 07:13:33	+zlg	I had no clue
2016-01-22 07:13:34	jerichowasahoax	personally i use cat/echo and shell redirects

2016-01-22 07:13:53	+Cheaterman	or is it 2012 or 2014 or 2016 now
2016-01-22 07:13:54	+zlg	jerichowasahoax: haha, I wonder if some wacko out there actually uses that.
2016-01-22 07:13:55	+Cheaterman	whatever
2016-01-22 07:14:02	jerichowasahoax	Cheaterman: latest is 2015

2016-01-22 07:15:05	+zlg	Not one-off operations.
2016-01-22 07:15:08	jerichowasahoax	zlg: there's some wacko who insists that "grep pattern /path/file.name" is incorrect and you MUST use "cat /path/file.name | grep pattern"

2016-01-22 07:15:22	+zlg	Cheaterman: haha
2016-01-22 07:15:30	+Cheaterman	zlg: I mean, I wasn't serious about vim of course. Vim does have syntax highlighting
2016-01-22 07:15:31	jerichowasahoax	zlg: and i don't mean in case of some ancient grep that doesn't support that, but at shell prompt too
2016-01-22 07:15:40	+Cheaterman	Using echo and shell redirects is what real men do

2016-01-22 07:17:39	+Cheaterman	best copypaste I found to avoid autoindent in vim for instance
2016-01-22 07:17:44	+zlg	But I don't learn anything effectively until I need it.
2016-01-22 07:17:45	+Cheaterman	cat - > myfile << EOF

2016-01-22 07:20:07	+Cheaterman	Owiii ^__^ no idea, I don't live on the right continent to know that I suppose
2016-01-22 07:20:12	jerichowasahoax	pretty sure i saw them run one of those in 2013 or something
2016-01-22 07:20:17	+zlg	wow
2016-01-22 07:20:18	+Cheaterman	also, I grew up in the 90's more than I lived them :)
2016-01-22 07:20:30	+zlg	I grew up in the 90s, too.
2016-01-22 07:20:39	+Cheaterman	Owiii ^__^ so we're not that old bliblibli
2016-01-22 07:20:46	+zlg	Tell that to my aching body

2016-01-22 07:22:40	+Cheaterman	makes sense, could apply to me too :/
2016-01-22 07:22:51	+zlg	I gained weight, my vision worsened...
2016-01-22 07:22:53	+Cheaterman	I do feel the aging a bit since like a year or two, in particular in back flexibility

2016-01-22 07:23:07	+Cheaterman	like, work positions make my back ache etc
2016-01-22 07:23:13	+Cheaterman	which used not to be a problem at all

2016-01-22 07:25:43	+zlg	I'm sure if I figured out how to cut calories effectively and find exercise that wasn't miserable I could get this gut to go away.

2016-01-22 07:34:53	+zlg	Busy is stressful.
2016-01-22 07:34:57	+Cheaterman	not always
2016-01-22 07:35:02	+Cheaterman	busy can be funny
2016-01-22 07:35:14	+zlg	Well, it depends on what you're busy with.
2016-01-22 07:35:15	+Cheaterman	and boring can be very, very, very, [...] destructive
2016-01-22 07:35:21	+Cheaterman	true ;)
2016-01-22 07:35:41	+xiaomiao	I don't understand boring
2016-01-22 07:35:45	+xiaomiao	there's always stuff to do
2016-01-22 07:35:48	+zlg	I spent hours screwing around with CSS and my Supercard DSTWO and stuff like that yesterday.
2016-01-22 07:35:48	+xiaomiao	life is short
2016-01-22 07:36:13	+Cheaterman	xiaomiao: I agree alot
2016-01-22 07:36:19	+zlg	xiaomiao: Sometimes you've just had enough of what's in front of you and haven't decided what to do next.
2016-01-22 07:36:19	+Cheaterman	When I'm bored, I unbore myself
2016-01-22 07:36:30	+Cheaterman	zlg: that calls for unboring
2016-01-22 07:36:48	+zlg	Boredom's important, because it can be inspiring.
2016-01-22 07:36:56	+zlg	Not "He's so bored, amazing!"
2016-01-22 07:36:57	+Cheaterman	:-/ actually not
2016-01-22 07:37:07	+zlg	But "I'm bored, let's find something cool to do"
2016-01-22 07:37:08	+Cheaterman	boredom kills brain cells fyi
2016-01-22 07:37:13	+Cheaterman	yes
2016-01-22 07:37:17	+Cheaterman	that's called unboring :)

2016-01-22 07:37:37	+zlg	Creativity is also fueled by boredom because the brain doesn't like being bored.
2016-01-22 07:37:39	+Cheaterman	not unbothering, because that would actually exist
2016-01-22 07:37:43	+zlg	So it's motivated to be unbored.
2016-01-22 07:37:45	+xiaomiao	zlg: that's called "being tired" ;)
2016-01-22 07:37:49	+Cheaterman	zlg: fair point!
2016-01-22 07:37:59	+Cheaterman	i just give it a lil extra puTHC
2016-01-22 07:38:00	+Cheaterman	push*
2016-01-22 07:38:01	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-01-22 07:38:03	+zlg	haha
2016-01-22 07:38:21	+zlg	When I get another job I'll get back to regular smoking.
2016-01-22 07:38:42	+zlg	Until then I have to consent to my private life being scrutinized by a for-profit entity with no accountability should that information get leaked.
2016-01-22 07:39:00	+xiaomiao	zlg: that's ... literally worse than China
2016-01-22 07:39:07	+Cheaterman	in a sense, yes
2016-01-22 07:39:38	+zlg	xiaomiao: That's the War on Drugs and MURICA for you
2016-01-22 07:40:20	+xiaomiao	zlg: and that's why I won't fly there
2016-01-22 07:40:26	+xiaomiao	even if work offers me 2 weeks in SF
2016-01-22 07:40:31	+zlg	xiaomiao: Can't say I blame you.
2016-01-22 07:40:41	+zlg	There are some good aspect
2016-01-22 07:40:44	+zlg	s to living here
2016-01-22 07:40:49	+xiaomiao	zlg: the sexual harassment smurfs at the border are enough already :)
2016-01-22 07:40:50	+zlg	But more than enough cons, too
2016-01-22 07:41:09	+zlg	xiaomiao: I had a very polite man pat me down the last time I flew.
2016-01-22 07:41:14	catpiggest	xiaomiao, sexual harassment panda
2016-01-22 07:41:27	catpiggest	not smurf
2016-01-22 07:41:37	+zlg	I refuse to go through a backscatter machine. If they're going to sexually harass me, I want them to be just as uncomfortable as me.
2016-01-22 07:41:56	+xiaomiao	zlg: last dozen times I flew no one patted me down
2016-01-22 07:42:04	+zlg	xiaomiao: must be nice :p
2016-01-22 07:42:04	+xiaomiao	no nudie scanner
2016-01-22 07:42:16	+xiaomiao	just ... like ... walk through metal detector. done.
2016-01-22 07:42:30	+zlg	And yet people still find ways to get weapons onto planes here.
2016-01-22 07:42:32	catpiggest	xiaomiao, for a few years they additionally padded down everyone in germany
2016-01-22 07:42:40	+zlg	Pro tip: don't pay your TSA agents minimum wage.
2016-01-22 07:42:54	+xiaomiao	catpiggest: can't let a mineshaft gap happen!
2016-01-22 07:43:52	catpiggest	hehe
2016-01-22 07:44:16	+zlg	Welp, time to go run a few errands. I should be back in an hour or so.

2016-01-22 08:08:55	gizmore	to use it to find also dotfiles... the problem with find is, that it includes the root... so /var/tmp should not show up in find /var/tmp
2016-01-22 08:09:23	+hosler	are you trying to delete dot files or just find them?
2016-01-22 08:09:35	+hosler	your first rm command would clear out everything in /var/tmp

2016-01-22 10:23:35	+igli	anyone can do a stage4, it's trivial, or always has been. releng are doing some for cloud as they're interested in it.
2016-01-22 10:24:04	+iamben	it's a pet project of prometheanfire, i think it's for openstack
2016-01-22 10:24:23	+iamben	i wish he'd announce something or put it out of the way somewhere
2016-01-22 10:25:32	mvaenskae	what is "openstack"? :)
2016-01-22 10:25:49	+iamben	some cloud stuff
2016-01-22 10:26:04	+iamben	i think he also said something like "it might work on AWS"

2016-01-22 10:32:17	+iamben	yes, i wish there were some announcement or explanation BEFORE they showed up in the official stage3 dir
2016-01-22 10:34:31	+igli	hrm well i was told that "stage4 will be the new default", but i have a feeling that was over-enthusiasm, since it's a bad idea to lose the stage3 milestone, however easily it may be accomplished behind the scenes.
2016-01-22 10:34:44	mvaenskae	new drive behind luks/lvm and 110MB/s is quite nice :)
2016-01-22 10:35:05	+igli	gotta love lvm/device-mapper. :)
2016-01-22 10:35:08	Tear	what *is* stage4?
2016-01-22 10:35:40	+iamben	Tear: basically it's a stage3 with some extra stuff in @world preinstalled

2016-01-22 10:35:43	+igli	it's a stage3 you add some of your own stuff to, and then tar up to use as an install stage, similarly to stage3, just with more stuff.
2016-01-22 10:35:44	+Monkeh	mvaenskae: 110, so cute :)
2016-01-22 10:35:45	mvaenskae	even 116MB/s \o/ respectable :)
2016-01-22 10:36:05	+iamben	igli: i think they're still thinking about whether they will CALL it stage4, or stage3.5, or just stage3
2016-01-22 10:36:06	Tear	so an install that's usable instantly after cloning?
2016-01-22 10:36:07	mvaenskae	Monkeh: luks does have some overhead
2016-01-22 10:36:18	+igli	iamben: well, no accounting for lunarcy ;)
2016-01-22 10:36:24	Tear	for you, i mean
2016-01-22 10:36:34	+iamben	Tear: the particular stage4 author can decide if it's got just one extra package or 300

2016-01-22 10:36:50	mvaenskae	i prefer to stay with stage3 as default
2016-01-22 10:37:03	mvaenskae	it teaches a bit of the beginnings as well :)
2016-01-22 10:37:09	+iamben	mvaenskae: well the idea would be to move stuff like nano to stage4
2016-01-22 10:37:15	Tear	i wouldn't mind stage4s with DEs
2016-01-22 10:37:23	+igli	up to whoever, yeah. point is that it may involve packages with heavy dependencies, that releng does not, and should not, need to worry about.
2016-01-22 10:37:31	+iamben	things that it woudl be hard to install gentoo without, but which are not strictly needed to build a system from scratch
2016-01-22 10:37:53	+iamben	some net tools might move to stage4, so they'd be preinstalled but removable
2016-01-22 10:38:21	mvaenskae	i would love to see even smaller images than stage3
2016-01-22 10:38:35	mvaenskae	then again, there is the lfs guide collection ;)
2016-01-22 10:38:36	+igli	oh that nano stuff etc really is lame. like it's heavy, but let's use that as an excuse to dump all the heavy deps of systemdbust onto releng's shoulders, instead of keeping the process distinct, as it is now.
2016-01-22 10:39:03	+iamben	igli: what on earth are you talking about?
2016-01-22 10:39:15	mvaenskae	i for one would vote for vim in stage3 per default
2016-01-22 10:39:23	+igli	just remove sys-apps/ed from virtual/editor already, as should have been done *ages* ago.
2016-01-22 10:39:28	mvaenskae	seriously, how does one nano?
2016-01-22 10:39:38	+igli	not even #ed users would go along with that dumbass call.
2016-01-22 10:39:52	+Monkeh	mvaenskae: Clumsily?
2016-01-22 10:40:10	mvaenskae	Monkeh: destructivly more likely
2016-01-22 10:40:15	+igli	and add it to @system so we can have POSIX.2/automake ready out of the box.
2016-01-22 10:40:21	mvaenskae	the moment i go inside nano i am... like what?!
2016-01-22 10:40:25	+igli	again, very light linkage.
2016-01-22 10:40:49	mvaenskae	igli: i am confused, remove ed but keep it?
2016-01-22 10:41:06	+igli	mvaenskae: try re-reading. remember: this is more like email than you imagine.
2016-01-22 10:42:28	+iamben	boy arent you pleasant this evening
2016-01-22 10:42:31	+igli	iamben: stage4 was being discussed a while back, and i was all for teams doing their own (why hasn't it been done before? users do them all the time.. etc.)  instead we've got "stage4 is the new default" so we can push systemdbust as a "default gentoo" even when it isn't, and many users avoid it like the plague, or have joined so they can avoid it.
2016-01-22 10:42:34	mvaenskae	i haven't yet touched the virtual/editors package so i do not know what rules it has
2016-01-22 10:42:53	+iamben	igli: what is systemdbust? are you referring to systemd?

2016-01-22 10:45:51	+igli	or you know, question the bleeding obvious to get a rise, which is simply trolling in my book. if you don't like my opinions, feel free to ignore them, express your own, or just do sth else.
2016-01-22 10:46:14	*	Monkeh cocks the handbags
2016-01-22 10:46:26	+iamben	you think that stage4 is a scheme to get systemd to take over gentoo?

2016-01-22 10:46:33	+iamben	what on earth are you going on about?
2016-01-22 10:46:46	+igli	i know that "stage4 is the new default" is precisely that, in the background.

2016-01-22 11:20:19	+zlg	I've not heard anything about stage4 being the new default.
2016-01-22 11:20:50	+zlg	I highly doubt any developers want to curtail stage3s at all. Adding a stage4 *option* would be just that; an option.
2016-01-22 11:21:08	+shadowdaemon	Yeah, I hope so.
2016-01-22 11:21:26	+zlg	A stage3 already contains a pretty complete, workable Gentoo system.
2016-01-22 11:21:31	+shadowdaemon	I don't miss stage1 particularly much.  =P
2016-01-22 11:21:48	+zlg	stage4 at this point would be the equivalent of premade disk images or something.
2016-01-22 11:22:02	+shadowdaemon	I don't mind the idea of a stage4.
2016-01-22 11:22:14	+zlg	Me either. It may work fantastically for some people.
2016-01-22 11:22:45	+zlg	I don't see stage3s going away because it's at a good sweet spot where users can setup their partitioning and everything in advance, *then* install Gentoo onto it.
2016-01-22 11:22:55	+shadowdaemon	yup
2016-01-22 11:23:17	+shadowdaemon	And very small download size is good.
2016-01-22 11:23:33	+shadowdaemon	When compared with most other distros.
2016-01-22 11:23:35	+zlg	stage4 would be "Okay I have the recommended 20GB partition recommended for Gentoo, lets dd it and add my /home to fstab"
2016-01-22 11:23:41	+zlg	Yeah, it is.
2016-01-22 11:23:45	+zlg	iirc it's only a few hundred megs.
2016-01-22 11:24:31	+zlg	Anyway, that person was making a bunch of noise for nothing.
2016-01-22 11:24:55	+zlg	If there was something going on major about stage4 becoming a new default, releng would let the rest of us devs know so we can support it.
2016-01-22 11:26:03	catpiggest	stage4 cant become the default. that'd be like debian making sid the default or RH shipping an alpha-fedora as the next RHEL ;)

2016-01-22 11:32:34	 < 	linux_dream (~linux_dre@unaffiliated/linux-dream/x-5839402) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-22 11:32:43	redcheckers	trix`G: well, i'd go on a boat with it and a freight ticket :)
2016-01-22 11:32:47	redcheckers	catpiggest: no, nabir is
2016-01-22 11:32:52	redcheckers	nabir even called me
2016-01-22 11:33:02	catpiggest	redcheckers, only bids made in this channel are entertained
2016-01-22 11:33:04	redcheckers	catpiggest: who is nabir? some guy who called me about the car.
2016-01-22 11:33:13	redcheckers	catpiggest: no, i am entertained by other bids ^_^
2016-01-22 11:33:18	+shadowdaemon	Honest Abdul.
2016-01-22 11:33:24	redcheckers	shadowdaemon: no, not abdul, nabir.
2016-01-22 11:33:28	+shadowdaemon	Oh.
2016-01-22 11:33:34	redcheckers	shadowdaemon: and he has this really cool accent that reminds me of morrocans
2016-01-22 11:33:42	+shadowdaemon	redcheckers: Hash?
2016-01-22 11:33:50	redcheckers	shadowdaemon: no not hashish, morroca the place
2016-01-22 11:33:50	+shadowdaemon	Oh... accent.
2016-01-22 11:33:59	redcheckers	morroco*
2016-01-22 11:34:03	trix`G	so what kind of car?
2016-01-22 11:34:12	*	redcheckers imagines a water moccasin dying in morroco and being made into moccasins.
2016-01-22 11:34:15	*	mvaenskae doesn't want to reboot his machine
2016-01-22 11:34:23	redcheckers	which would then be morrocan water moccasin moccasins made in morroco.
2016-01-22 11:34:24	mvaenskae	just to install windows games
2016-01-22 11:34:28	catpiggest	mvaenskae, rm /bin/shutdown
2016-01-22 11:34:37	trix`G	lmao
2016-01-22 11:34:38	redcheckers	mvaenskae: you could use.... xen
2016-01-22 11:35:00	redcheckers	trix`G: a toyo-ta
2016-01-22 11:35:00	mvaenskae	catpiggest: there is still init 0
2016-01-22 11:35:13	catpiggest	mvaenskae, rm /bin/init
2016-01-22 11:35:14	redcheckers	mvaenskae: isnt there an acpi command to turn off power too?
2016-01-22 11:35:26	redcheckers	catpiggest: mv /bin /bin2
2016-01-22 11:35:30	mvaenskae	redcheckers: still a reboot, don't have xen installed
2016-01-22 11:35:34	catpiggest	ah yes, much easier
2016-01-22 11:35:39	trix`G	I feel your pain mvaenskae, though to a lesser degree.  I should boot into the new kernel I just installed so my sound will work.  But, meh, don't want to
2016-01-22 11:35:49	redcheckers	mvaenskae: but it's a single reboot.
2016-01-22 11:35:55	catpiggest	rm -rf / should also prevent rebooting. there might be undesired side-effects
2016-01-22 11:36:05	+shadowdaemon	trix`G: It's delayed gratification.
2016-01-22 11:36:07	mvaenskae	trix`G: my kernel boots so much quicker than my bios that i feel slowed down by it
2016-01-22 11:36:33	mvaenskae	catpiggest: someone thought people are too lazy so now you need --no-preserve-root iirc
2016-01-22 11:37:31	catpiggest	hm. could just dd all drives i guess
2016-01-22 11:38:03	mvaenskae	0.7seconds until my initramfs asks for my password; if i were to automate that process by virtue of a challenge response mechanism i could make it likely boot in around 8ish seconds i guess
2016-01-22 11:38:10	mvaenskae	without sysetemd magic
2016-01-22 11:38:17	redcheckers	mvaenskae: or just boot -s
2016-01-22 11:38:45	mvaenskae	catpiggest: secure erase is on SSDs much quicker
2016-01-22 11:39:12	redcheckers	catpiggest: and the 'secure' is more of a name thing... like how the pokemon 'cool porygon' is a porygon.
2016-01-22 11:39:33	redcheckers	catpiggest: are you MooingLemur ? or just mooinglemurserve ?
2016-01-22 11:39:40	catpiggest	redcheckers, neither
2016-01-22 11:39:53	catpiggest	MooingLemur is MooingLemur
2016-01-22 11:40:04	*	mvaenskae should build a new kernel thinking of it
2016-01-22 11:40:34	redcheckers	mvaenskae: do it!
2016-01-22 11:41:02	redcheckers	if only there was a way to automatically build a new kernel every time you emerged kernel sources, and check for a .config file from your last /usr/src/linux directory
2016-01-22 11:41:24	mvaenskae	redcheckers: i created a script that takes care of kernel building
2016-01-22 11:41:32	redcheckers	mvaenskae: cool
2016-01-22 11:41:33	mvaenskae	and module signing, but not the signing of the efi binary
2016-01-22 11:41:50	redcheckers	mvaenskae: btw, is the zen-sources masked kernel ebuild the one for xen, or is xen patched into regular gentoo-sources now?
2016-01-22 11:41:54	trix`G	so what's the best Xorg frontend to mplayer in your guys' opinion?
2016-01-22 11:42:03	trix`G	I haven't really used much apart from SMplayer and I don't really like that one
2016-01-22 11:42:05	mvaenskae	i have no idea of xen
2016-01-22 11:42:09	catpiggest	redcheckers, xen made it into upstream i think
2016-01-22 11:42:12	redcheckers	mvaenskae: oh. ok.
2016-01-22 11:42:14	redcheckers	catpiggest: cool
2016-01-22 11:42:16	catpiggest	trix`G, mpv is nice
2016-01-22 11:42:38	catpiggest	redcheckers, not all of it, but i think the essential stuff is upstream now. but dont quote me on this
2016-01-22 11:43:09	redcheckers	oh.
2016-01-22 11:43:23	*	redcheckers removes the "quotation marks" from catpiggest 
2016-01-22 11:43:40	redeyedman	G31-ESL V2
2016-01-22 11:43:51	trix`G	catpiggest: Never heard of that one.  Portage description says it's a media player based on Mplayer and Mplayer2.  Is it a front-end or it's own standalone media player?
2016-01-22 11:44:11	catpiggest	trix`G, fork i think
2016-01-22 11:44:15	redcheckers	trix`G: it gets mentioned a lot in here
2016-01-22 11:44:18	catpiggest	or successor
2016-01-22 11:44:23	catpiggest	mplayer* is confusing
2016-01-22 11:44:26	redcheckers	i like how it updates its youtube code without re-emerging when desired
2016-01-22 11:44:48	redeyedman	G31-ESL V2 mobo working 6 years
2016-01-22 11:44:49	redcheckers	brb though, fetching additional layers of clothing
2016-01-22 11:45:08	catpiggest	redcheckers, just set fire to something
2016-01-22 11:45:09	trix`G	ok I'll give it a shot, thanks!
2016-01-22 11:45:10	mvaenskae	redcheckers: https://bpaste.net/show/954c0b4987b1
2016-01-22 11:45:13	catpiggest	like mvaenskae's computer
2016-01-22 11:45:16	redcheckers	redeyedman: i dont know what mobo i have :( but i do know my laptop isnt doing enough to heat the room
2016-01-22 11:45:17	mvaenskae	this is my kernel build script
2016-01-22 11:45:19	redcheckers	catpiggest: i did that already

2016-01-22 11:45:35	redcheckers	mvaenskae: i am in console :(((
2016-01-22 11:46:03	mvaenskae	there is also sakakis https://github.com/sakaki-/buildkernel which is a lot more powerful than mine
2016-01-22 11:46:18	redcheckers	ok, got it saved for later.
2016-01-22 11:46:21	mvaenskae	redcheckers: wget https://bpaste.net/raw/954c0b4987b1
2016-01-22 11:46:25	redcheckers	oh. a sakaki link too?
2016-01-22 11:46:34	mvaenskae	should give you just the raw contents
2016-01-22 11:46:53	redcheckers	hmmn i ran it in exec, but it exec -o'd ?
2016-01-22 11:47:07	redcheckers	mvaenskae: did all of that paste to channel lol? or just to me
2016-01-22 11:47:12	trix`G	redcheckers: lol my 12 bitcoin miners in the garage keep that area 90 degrees when it's -4 degrees F outside
2016-01-22 11:47:19	mvaenskae	nothing pasted in here
2016-01-22 11:47:20	trix`G	if you want a nerdy space heater i'll sell you a couple
2016-01-22 11:47:23	redcheckers	trix`G: pool or not?
2016-01-22 11:47:29	redcheckers	trix`G: how much?
2016-01-22 11:47:30	trix`G	pool yes, of course
2016-01-22 11:47:42	redcheckers	trix`G: i dont like the trust requirement of pool mining much
2016-01-22 11:47:48	redcheckers	trix`G: i could get gox'ed ?
2016-01-22 11:48:12	mvaenskae	my kernel should be done in a few :)
2016-01-22 11:48:14	trix`G	trust requirement?  They send the payment to my personal wallet every time I hit about $2 worth of mining
2016-01-22 11:48:34	mvaenskae	writing this kernel automagic build script was the best thing i could have done
2016-01-22 11:48:38	redcheckers	trix`G: ah, most the pools i looked at look at a percentage payout of a successful mine
2016-01-22 11:48:45	redcheckers	trix`G: so you get paid per hash?
2016-01-22 11:48:51	trix`G	and the only person that can send funds out of my personal wallet is me
2016-01-22 11:48:51	redcheckers	even if they don't find gold?
2016-01-22 11:49:17	*	mvaenskae wishes he had participated in bitcoin when it was small
2016-01-22 11:49:22	trix`G	sort of, most pools nowadays are on some sort of pay per share derived payout system, you get paid for your work regardless of pool luck
2016-01-22 11:50:02	trix`G	some pools go a bit less during bad luck streaks and a bit more during good luck streaks but my pool (slush) is just straight up pay for hashrate over time
2016-01-22 11:50:29	mvaenskae	wheee, new kernel and already set to boot \o/
2016-01-22 11:50:43	trix`G	mvaenskae: I did, I generated something like 3000 bitcoins way back when they weren't worth 10 cents altogether.  Lost that wallet years ago and have been hitting myself since =(
2016-01-22 11:51:11	catpiggest	trix`G, arent they up to several hundred USD each by now?
2016-01-22 11:51:14	mvaenskae	redcheckers: regarding sakaki's buildkernel, i would read his efi install guide to understand what he tries to accomplish and set up
2016-01-22 11:51:17	trix`G	yeah
2016-01-22 11:51:21	catpiggest	enough to make you a millionaire?
2016-01-22 11:51:27	mvaenskae	trix`G: O U C H
2016-01-22 11:51:28	trix`G	yeah =(
2016-01-22 11:51:35	redeyedman	I like PC rather than laptops
2016-01-22 11:51:39	catpiggest	thats harsh
2016-01-22 11:51:46	catpiggest	http://img.desmotivaciones.es/201011/Videoschistososdegatos.jpg
2016-01-22 11:51:49	mvaenskae	/bin/sh: 1: bc: not found
2016-01-22 11:51:52	mvaenskae	meh :(
2016-01-22 11:51:56	mvaenskae	no bc installed
2016-01-22 11:52:09	redcheckers	trix`G: i see.
2016-01-22 11:52:11	mvaenskae	around 400 for a coin, right?
2016-01-22 11:52:17	trix`G	yes and no, by the time I remembered that wallet even existed bitcoin was at like $50 each and the hard drive that wallet was on had been gone for a couple years
2016-01-22 11:52:25	redcheckers	trix`G: how hard to turn my laptop into a miner ?
2016-01-22 11:52:42	trix`G	so when I realized what I could have had it sucked yeah but it's not like I had it and lost it, it was already lost before it was worth anything
2016-01-22 11:53:02	trix`G	mvaenskae: yeah $375-$450 in the last month or two
2016-01-22 11:53:27	trix`G	redcheckers: very easy, but the paltry amount of bitcoin you'd mine with a laptop is not worth it.
2016-01-22 11:53:40	redcheckers	trix`G: but i can plug it in for free everywhere i go :)

2016-01-22 11:53:49	mvaenskae	that is about 1.2M usd :(
2016-01-22 11:53:50	trix`G	redcheckers: it would take more than a year to mine a dollar
2016-01-22 11:53:55	redcheckers	trix`G: i see.
2016-01-22 11:54:02	redcheckers	catpiggest: no. i can plug it in for free everywhere i go :)
2016-01-22 11:54:28	mvaenskae	redcheckers: mining bitcoins these days is a huge undertaking in computational power
2016-01-22 11:54:36	trix`G	i pay $1100 USD per month for electric
2016-01-22 11:54:37	redcheckers	mvaenskae: or blind luck
2016-01-22 11:54:46	redcheckers	trix`G: my electric is included in my rent ^_^
2016-01-22 11:54:49	trix`G	and I make about $1450 in bitcoin
2016-01-22 11:54:51	mvaenskae	these days you buy specific hardware to calculate that quick
2016-01-22 11:54:58	redcheckers	trix`G: but i only have 14 open outlets
2016-01-22 11:55:09	mvaenskae	and that ain't even quick
2016-01-22 11:55:12	trix`G	redcheckers: mine was too until the first $800+ bill came in and my landlord was like PAY THAT
2016-01-22 11:55:20	Tear	so it's basicallt stealing from your landlord
2016-01-22 11:55:24	redcheckers	trix`G: hehe. i can always move into a hotel.
2016-01-22 11:55:38	trix`G	redcheckers: I had to pay an electrician $500 to install four 30A industrial electrical outlets into the garage
2016-01-22 11:55:52	catpiggest	Tear, how so? if you dont wanna include unlimited unmetered power in your rental contract - don't.
2016-01-22 11:55:55	redcheckers	trix`G: i can beer an electrician to do that for me ^_^
2016-01-22 11:56:02	redcheckers	trix`G: but since its a rental i dont wanna

2016-01-22 11:56:11	mvaenskae	redcheckers: i am certain that the moment you go above a certain threshold your landlord will either increase the rent or change your contract to remove electricity from the monthly fee
2016-01-22 11:56:11	redcheckers	l
2016-01-22 11:56:24	redcheckers	mvaenskae: thats when i'd move.
2016-01-22 11:56:36	redcheckers	mvaenskae: if you don't like the new contract when the old one expires... you move
2016-01-22 11:56:53	trix`G	mvaenskae: I am also running 6 miners in a head shop in Milwaukee that has electricity included in their rent.  They have a glass blowing studio also so extreme energy use is normal
2016-01-22 11:57:11	trix`G	I give them 20% of the bitcoins I get from the mining in return for the free electric
2016-01-22 11:57:22	mvaenskae	interesting split :)
2016-01-22 11:57:41	trix`G	they have a bitcoin ATM machine in their store so they like using their 20% cut to keep it stocked with BTC
2016-01-22 11:58:16	redcheckers	trix`G: neat. i'd love having a bitcoin atm machine :)
2016-01-22 11:58:21	trix`G	well the 20% figure isn't just for the miners, I sell various custom electronics and robotics in their store and they get 20% of all sales
2016-01-22 11:58:28	catpiggest	trix`G, does that mean you transfer bitcoins to the atm owner and the atm gives you cash?
2016-01-22 11:58:33	redcheckers	trix`G: i saw a blog post of a portable bitcoin vending machine at defcon
2016-01-22 11:58:46	redcheckers	catpiggest: no the machine vends bitcoins
2016-01-22 11:58:49	trix`G	catpiggest: well their machine accepts cash automatically and deposits bitcoin into a bitcoin wallet
2016-01-22 11:58:56	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-22 11:58:59	catpiggest	reverse atm ^^
2016-01-22 11:59:11	trix`G	catpiggest: I have my mining pool set so 20% of the generated bitcoins automatically payout to the ATM's bitcoin wallet
2016-01-22 11:59:15	redcheckers	trix`G: how do i set up a machine like that? i know several bars that would probably let me put it there
2016-01-22 11:59:22	redcheckers	(in exchange for a percentage)
2016-01-22 11:59:38	catpiggest	anyone else read that 3parter about the hacked ATMs in mexico?
2016-01-22 11:59:50	trix`G	redcheckers: they use a raspberry pi and a touchscreen and camera, then have a custom made bill accepting machine that communicates with it
2016-01-22 11:59:52	redcheckers	catpiggest: no. but i hate how mexican atms limit your withdrawal amount to 500 pesos

2016-01-22 12:00:49	catpiggest	stoners are too lazy to rob an ATM ;)

2016-01-22 12:01:09	trix`G	it was a real bitcoin ATM they bought second-hand but the company stopped supporting it so they had to custom rig it to work again

2016-01-22 12:01:35	redcheckers	trix`G: well. what about taking one of those old game vending machines, and adding a bitcoin feature to it
2016-01-22 12:01:40	redcheckers	it already takes money, and runs gentoo
2016-01-22 12:01:49	redcheckers	but it uses busybox so i'm guessing not a lot of ram

2016-01-22 12:02:26	redcheckers	trix`G: and i can get the old game machines for around 2-300 each , more if i buy bulk
2016-01-22 12:02:29	mvaenskae	i need to redownload all my humble bundle games :(
2016-01-22 12:02:47	trix`G	that could be cool I suppose yeah
2016-01-22 12:02:55	redcheckers	trix`G: how much space/process do you reckon the actual bitcoin wallet and vending feature would take?
2016-01-22 12:02:55	catpiggest	mvaenskae, i thought it was implied that i was joking when i told you to dd your drives ;)
2016-01-22 12:03:20	redcheckers	trix`G: aka, storage space, and ram space, and cpu strength requirements?
2016-01-22 12:03:29	redcheckers	trix`G: do they have to compute some hashes?
2016-01-22 12:03:33	mvaenskae	catpiggest: i got a new drive today, HGST Deskstar 4TB
2016-01-22 12:03:41	mvaenskae	as my previous drive crashed
2016-01-22 12:03:49	trix`G	redcheckers: no idea, a regular raspberry pi can handle it
2016-01-22 12:03:50	catpiggest	ah ok
2016-01-22 12:03:53	mvaenskae	at 29k hours
2016-01-22 12:03:55	redcheckers	trix`G: ok.
2016-01-22 12:03:58	catpiggest	harsh
2016-01-22 12:04:31	redcheckers	trix`G: i will see about getting a couple of those game machine boxes, and search some illegal content sites to see if anyone has info or backups of their softwares
2016-01-22 12:04:43	redcheckers	trix`G: then i could get my own easy to install update for the machines
2016-01-22 12:04:54	redcheckers	and repurpose and maybe even resell at a higher price, the bitcoin ready models
2016-01-22 12:04:57	redcheckers	it'd be fun
2016-01-22 12:05:15	mvaenskae	wierd bug of the day
2016-01-22 12:05:20	redcheckers	and if nothing else, i can make my money back if 400-500 people play the 1 dollar games on it.
2016-01-22 12:05:26	mvaenskae	my keyboard just started typing 'o'
2016-01-22 12:05:43	mvaenskae	no way to stop it until unplugging the keyboard :(
2016-01-22 12:06:10	catpiggest	mvaenskae, i had that with 'k' last night. until i noticed the k-key was stuck
2016-01-22 12:06:31	mvaenskae	my o key wasn't
2016-01-22 12:06:41	redcheckers	catpiggest: thats not o.
2016-01-22 12:06:58	mvaenskae	looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
2016-01-22 12:07:02	catpiggest	redcheckers, they're right next to each other tho

2016-01-22 12:09:46	mvaenskae	then i will do it in a heartbeat

2016-01-22 12:10:34	redcheckers	Monkeh: i bought a keyboard to practice typing in russian with, but then i sold my raspberry pi :( so i have a dual cyrillic english usb 2.0 keyboard just gathering dust

2016-01-22 12:11:03	*	mvaenskae wonders how buckling springs will do in gaming
2016-01-22 12:12:11	mvaenskae	i really really want soemthing nicer to type on but i have a feeling that a) expensive b) i have a still very new keyboard (5 years old now i think) and c) my neighbourhood will hate me as i usually stay awake deep into the night
2016-01-22 12:12:24	redcheckers	mvaenskae: can they hear you typing ?
2016-01-22 12:12:30	redcheckers	maybe less coffee and you will type more softly
2016-01-22 12:12:35	mvaenskae	on the unicomp i am quite certain
2016-01-22 12:12:36	+Monkeh	mvaenskae: So get a mechanical one with less noise
2016-01-22 12:12:41	mvaenskae	bucking spring
2016-01-22 12:12:59	redcheckers	Monkeh: my keyboard is mechanical and it makes far less noise than the youtube videos of sinead o conner that i play loudly
2016-01-22 12:12:59	mvaenskae	Monkeh: there is no way to make buckling spings silent
2016-01-22 12:13:11	+Monkeh	mvaenskae: That's why I said get a mechanical one with less noise.
2016-01-22 12:13:21	redcheckers	mvaenskae: sure there is. cut off the ears of everyone near by. like that buddhist tree falling in a forest thing
2016-01-22 12:13:36	mvaenskae	i use blacks, they are silent but i want something for typing, not something for gamign
2016-01-22 12:14:15	+Monkeh	So get browns
2016-01-22 12:14:34	mvaenskae	i have 3 different switches i am interested in, brown, blue, buckling spring
2016-01-22 12:15:05	mvaenskae	Monkeh: there is also the good thing with the bucking spring ones that you can find the original model M ones
2016-01-22 12:15:24	mvaenskae	you cannot ask for a better weapon
2016-01-22 12:16:21	mvaenskae	those things weigh more than workstation laptops these days and can be easily 2 decades old already

2016-01-22 12:18:00	+Monkeh	That's because they're basically membrane keyboards
2016-01-22 12:18:42	redcheckers	Monkeh: have you seen the led keyboards, that put out a keyboard design on a flat surface and then watch where you type?
2016-01-22 12:18:45	mvaenskae	redcheckers: the geneva convention explicitly prohibits the use of mass destruction D:
2016-01-22 12:20:02	redcheckers	mvaenskae: the geneva convention only restricts countries.

2016-01-22 12:24:11	catpiggest	mvaenskae, non-proliferation treaty also requires the nuclear powers to a) disarm and b) not spread their WMD tech or devices to other countries
2016-01-22 12:25:12	+Monkeh	ahahah, hahahaah, disarm, hahahaha. That's a good one.

2016-01-22 12:26:57	redcheckers	Monkeh: yep. bribe their politicians
2016-01-22 12:27:03	catpiggest	blow up the world? ^^

2016-01-22 12:27:35	torindel	Monkeh: that wont solve problem, you got to use your nukes on them so they will use up theirs ^^

2016-01-22 12:37:17	redcheckers	the warhead specifically
2016-01-22 12:37:29	redcheckers	like when jet planes drop ordinance, not all of it is combustible

2016-01-24 10:43:25	jwm224	Lightning and electricity, tho' in related proven science, outside slight subatomic particles and acting forces, can still at rare times behave unpredictable, like taking less likely paths to ground. It's still a theory. Oddly.

2016-01-24 10:51:44	cnnx	think i want a gin tonic
2016-01-24 10:51:45	Tear	and x won't start for some reason, no screens found even though i915 is loaded
2016-01-24 10:52:01	Smiley	 But the lightning went in and tried to come out her mouth or something.
2016-01-24 10:52:04	Smiley	No. Just no.
2016-01-24 10:52:16	Tear	it's like fglrx doesn't let any other drivers have a say in anything

2016-01-24 10:53:38	AsumFace	a 10m layer of pvc would probably stop lightning

2016-01-24 10:55:42	+iamben	within about 18 hours we had a new one delivered, configured, and installed... it was impressive =)
2016-01-24 10:55:43	Smiley	It hit my parents house twice
2016-01-24 10:55:54	+zlg	sup guys
2016-01-24 10:55:55	Smiley	Once was the pipe for the overflow on the boiler tank
2016-01-24 10:56:00	Smiley	the other was the TV aerial
2016-01-24 10:56:09	Smiley	The water tank one blew a hole in the side of the house
2016-01-24 10:56:23	Smiley	The TV aerial did nothing, didn't even fry the tv or radio it was connected to
2016-01-24 10:56:38	Smiley	But the cable ran down the outside of the house, to about 2 inches above the ground. That was fried however.
2016-01-24 10:57:29	jwm224	Smiley: Maybe we are talking the tail end of an almost dead bolt of ligtning too. But, yeah there are other forces at work. Crazy.
2016-01-24 10:57:53	Smiley	but surge protectors won't do anything against a lightning strike
2016-01-24 10:57:57	Smiley	and if you believe they will, you're stupid
2016-01-24 11:00:04	jwm224	I lost my asus motherboard to a lightning strike. It hit the tree too. It was plugged into a surge protector. completely fried... the fan crumbled.

2016-01-24 11:00:39	+zlg	What's the best solution in case of lightning then? Assuming your building already has a lightning rod...
2016-01-24 11:01:25	+iamben	surge protectors & insurance & a backup plan
2016-01-24 11:01:28	mvaenskae	zlg: you helped me with my soundcard a couple days ago, right?
2016-01-24 11:01:37	jwm224	Code in the US is two rods now. You used to be able to use the cold water pipe and one 8 foot ground rod. they changed that.
2016-01-24 11:01:49	+zlg	mvaenskae: I don't want to take credit for someone else's help; could you tell me more about what happened?
2016-01-24 11:01:49	Smiley	zlg: insurance
2016-01-24 11:01:57	cnnx	iamben: what do you think of current imacs from apple and would you own one?
2016-01-24 11:01:59	+zlg	jwm224: ah
2016-01-24 11:02:34	+iamben	cnnx: i wouldn't because in 4 years i'll be itching for new cpu/memory but have all that money invested in the nice display
2016-01-24 11:02:39	mvaenskae	zlg: asking how to disable a specific sound device that shares a common driver and the solution was to edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa to disable/enable them with a bitmask
2016-01-24 11:02:52	+zlg	mvaenskae: Doesn't sound familiar to me.
2016-01-24 11:02:58	+iamben	currently have an inherited 27" imac at work, display is still super nice, cpu/gpu is a turd now
2016-01-24 11:03:01	mvaenskae	meh, gotta search in my logs then >.>
2016-01-24 11:03:03	cnnx	iamben: yeah thats the problem with those things, are you the type of guy who upgrades your own computer parts as you need?
2016-01-24 11:03:04	+zlg	That's a neat trick, though. I'll have to remember it!

2016-01-24 11:39:50	cnnx	zlg: nice, profesionally or hobby
2016-01-24 11:40:02	+zlg	Hobby, though it'd be nice to get a job working with computers.
2016-01-24 11:40:11	cnnx	zlg: i think we are in the same boat
2016-01-24 11:40:13	+zlg	Being paid to work on Gentoo would be the best.

2016-01-24 11:40:42	+iamben	cnnx: i think that's what he's doing, on gentoo
2016-01-24 11:40:47	+zlg	cnnx: I've contributed to a few projects here and there but I feel like I need more practice in C and Python to get better
2016-01-24 11:40:58	+Cheaterman	zlg: owiii
2016-01-24 11:41:04	cnnx	zlg: I know C, not python
2016-01-24 11:41:04	+zlg	I want to build a video game at some point.
2016-01-24 11:41:11	cnnx	they didnt have python in college in 1994-1995
2016-01-24 11:41:12	+zlg	using SDL
2016-01-24 11:41:20	mushroomblue	I get paid to wear the IT hat, and when I'm wearing that IT hat, I get paid to use/work on gentoo.
2016-01-24 11:41:29	mushroomblue	it's nice.
2016-01-24 11:41:29	+zlg	noice

2016-01-24 11:41:33	+Cheaterman	noice!
2016-01-24 11:41:35	+Cheaterman	blibliblibli
2016-01-24 11:41:58	jwm224	I took C in college too. Well, C++. But, I like C better.
2016-01-24 11:42:07	cnnx	jwm224: me too, don't like OOP
2016-01-24 11:42:08	+zlg	I've enjoyed C so far.
2016-01-24 11:42:15	+Cheaterman	C++ are like "encapsulation blah blah"
2016-01-24 11:42:18	cnnx	pointers can be confusing, casting, etc
2016-01-24 11:42:19	+zlg	I'm in chapter 7 of 8 in the K&R.
2016-01-24 11:42:24	+Cheaterman	when really it's just getting in the way if you know what you're doing
2016-01-24 11:42:30	cnnx	i like deitel and deitel books
2016-01-24 11:42:31	+zlg	Looking forward to finishing it so I can read standards and start learning libraries.
2016-01-24 11:42:46	+Cheaterman	C is cool :)
2016-01-24 11:42:57	+Cheaterman	C++ is cool too, depends how you use it and what you do with it
2016-01-24 11:42:58	jwm224	cnnx: I always had a hardtime with classes. same here.
2016-01-24 11:43:01	+zlg	I like C's simplicity.
2016-01-24 11:43:10	cnnx	printf("Do you want another whiskey?\n");
2016-01-24 11:43:12	+Cheaterman	Python is awesome
2016-01-24 11:43:13	+zlg	OOP is a mess, though Python's is bearable.
2016-01-24 11:43:19	+Cheaterman	print "Do you want another whiskey?"
2016-01-24 11:43:22	cnnx	structured is better for me
2016-01-24 11:43:24	+zlg	Python's actually makes sense.
2016-01-24 11:43:30	+zlg	decorators are neat.
2016-01-24 11:43:33	+Cheaterman	Python is the most logical actually
2016-01-24 11:43:35	+Cheaterman	even more than C
2016-01-24 11:43:46	cnnx	i'll have to checkout python
2016-01-24 11:43:47	+Cheaterman	C has lots of legacy stuff
2016-01-24 11:43:48	+zlg	Ironic because Python was written in C.
2016-01-24 11:43:54	+Cheaterman	zlg: actually not at all
2016-01-24 11:43:55	cnnx	can you compile python into executable binaries?
2016-01-24 11:44:01	+Cheaterman	cnnx: definitely
2016-01-24 11:44:08	+Cheaterman	With Cython ^__^
2016-01-24 11:44:13	+zlg	Cheaterman: Then what is CPython?
2016-01-24 11:44:15	cnnx	but it requires on python shared libraries on the system
2016-01-24 11:44:16	+Cheaterman	zlg: CPython is just one implementation
2016-01-24 11:44:20	+zlg	iirc that's the reference implementation
2016-01-24 11:44:20	+Cheaterman	zlg: Jython is another for instance
2016-01-24 11:44:25	+Cheaterman	Yes it is :-)
2016-01-24 11:44:31	+Cheaterman	Python is a language, it's not written in anything
2016-01-24 11:44:32	jwm224	Yeah, I watched enough video on python, I should be a pro. I don't practice enough.
2016-01-24 11:44:40	mushroomblue	anyone learning rust?
2016-01-24 11:44:44	+Cheaterman	jwm224: Practice is what makes perfect though, not videos :)
2016-01-24 11:44:48	+zlg	I've considered Rust.
2016-01-24 11:44:49	cnnx	i should buy a python book
2016-01-24 11:44:52	+Cheaterman	mushroomblue: I know buddies who are very into this at #panda3d
2016-01-24 11:44:54	cnnx	how is python with communications?
2016-01-24 11:44:57	+Cheaterman	no idea why, seems nice from afar
2016-01-24 11:44:58	cnnx	like tcp ip client/servers?
2016-01-24 11:45:02	+Cheaterman	cnnx: so easy
2016-01-24 11:45:04	jwm224	Cheaterman: true. so true.
2016-01-24 11:45:06	+zlg	Python has an entire library for it.
2016-01-24 11:45:07	cnnx	easier than sockets?
2016-01-24 11:45:12	+zlg	Though it's not python3 capable yet iirc
2016-01-24 11:45:14	+zlg	twisted
2016-01-24 11:45:17	+Cheaterman	exactly zlg
2016-01-24 11:45:26	+Cheaterman	cnnx: you can do raw sockets if you want
2016-01-24 11:45:30	+Cheaterman	which is easier than in any other language
2016-01-24 11:45:39	+Cheaterman	but twisted is even easier than that to write your own protocols
2016-01-24 11:45:43	cnnx	ok i'll have to maybe consider buying a python book
2016-01-24 11:45:47	cnnx	is there a recommended one?
2016-01-24 11:45:56	+Cheaterman	don't you have... the.. internet?
2016-01-24 11:45:57	+zlg	I'd start with the documentation first tbh
2016-01-24 11:46:03	cnnx	ok
2016-01-24 11:46:06	cnnx	i like paper books
2016-01-24 11:46:07	cnnx	on the couch
2016-01-24 11:46:12	+Cheaterman	if you didn't know programming i'd tell you LPTHW
2016-01-24 11:46:15	+zlg	Nothing wrong with that
2016-01-24 11:46:18	+Cheaterman	but if you already code, it'll be boring
2016-01-24 11:46:23	cnnx	yeah

2016-01-24 11:52:57	+Cheaterman	yes we already said that
2016-01-24 11:52:57	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-01-24 11:53:06	+Cheaterman	it's a networking lib
2016-01-24 11:53:09	+Cheaterman	it's super useful
2016-01-24 11:53:11	+Cheaterman	it's python2 though
2016-01-24 11:53:15	+zlg	Python comes with a bunch of libraries built-in, though
2016-01-24 11:53:16	cnnx	ok ill start reading
2016-01-24 11:53:20	+zlg	'batteries included'
2016-01-24 11:53:22	+Cheaterman	Yeah, like sockets, etc
2016-01-24 11:53:24	+Cheaterman	yes :-)
2016-01-24 11:53:30	cnnx	its newer than C
2016-01-24 11:53:33	cnnx	so maybe its better than C
2016-01-24 11:53:39	+zlg	Nonsense.
2016-01-24 11:53:41	jwm224	it's good for writing something quick.
2016-01-24 11:53:54	+Cheaterman	it's just a totally different thing
2016-01-24 11:53:58	+Cheaterman	but yeah generally it's better
2016-01-24 11:54:01	 < 	DeafKids (~DeafKids@unaffiliated/frozenpigs) has quit (Quit: Kernel Panic)
2016-01-24 11:54:39	+Cheaterman	write stuff quicker, with less lines so it's easier to maintain, and usually better structure
2016-01-24 11:54:48	jwm224	Yeah, I'd say C is stabler... depending on the writer. Is stabler a word?
2016-01-24 11:54:52	+zlg	more stable
2016-01-24 11:54:53	*	cnnx is reading the wiki on python
2016-01-24 11:54:56	+Cheaterman	C is definitely not more stable
2016-01-24 11:55:02	+Cheaterman	you do the memory management yourself
2016-01-24 11:55:03	+zlg	^
2016-01-24 11:55:07	+Cheaterman	and it often is a female dog
2016-01-24 11:55:15	+zlg	la chienne
2016-01-24 11:55:21	cnnx	Cheaterman: its C not B!!
2016-01-24 11:55:22	+Cheaterman	exactement, la chienne
2016-01-24 11:55:40	+Cheaterman	cnnx: in Python you don't manage the memory yourself, at least not directly
2016-01-24 11:55:42	cnnx	oh mon dieux
2016-01-24 11:55:51	+zlg	Can you even do memory management in Python?
2016-01-24 11:55:53	jwm224	Cheaterman: That's why I said depending on the writer.
2016-01-24 11:55:58	cnnx	Cheaterman: so none of that malloc() ?
2016-01-24 11:56:01	+zlg	Beyond unsetting variables?
2016-01-24 11:56:01	+Cheaterman	but you can use your abstractions more properly if you know how the underlying memory is managed, which is mentioned in the docs
2016-01-24 11:56:12	+Cheaterman	zlg: definitely yes
2016-01-24 11:56:17	+zlg	I need to get better with understanding malloc.
2016-01-24 11:56:27	iamben	malloc is a kind of duck, right?
2016-01-24 11:56:29	cnnx	zlg: to assign memory block
2016-01-24 11:56:33	+zlg	from what I understand, I allocate bytes and assign a pointer to said bytes, then free it
2016-01-24 11:56:33	cnnx	allocation
2016-01-24 11:56:40	cnnx	lets say you have a linked list right
2016-01-24 11:56:50	cnnx	you want each node to have a memory allocated to it
2016-01-24 11:56:52	+Cheaterman	iamben: what do you mean
2016-01-24 11:56:52	cnnx	dynamically
2016-01-24 11:56:55	cnnx	to be effecient
2016-01-24 11:57:23	cnnx	and then you can release that memory (free it) when you are done
2016-01-24 11:57:37	+Cheaterman	zlg: malloc does the allocation part, and gives you back a pointer to this memory
2016-01-24 11:57:42	+Cheaterman	also, it's contiguous memory, worth noting
2016-01-24 11:57:45	+zlg	Cheaterman: right
2016-01-24 11:57:51	jwm224	short for "memory allocation"
2016-01-24 11:57:54	+Cheaterman	so you just ask malloc for a certain amount of bytes, and it sends you back a pointer
2016-01-24 11:57:56	jwm224	I believe
2016-01-24 11:58:00	+Cheaterman	quite, yes
2016-01-24 11:58:04	cnnx	right
2016-01-24 11:58:16	+zlg	And if the memory is going to be used for multiple data types, you'll want to use a void pointer or a pointer to a union, right?
2016-01-24 11:58:18	cnnx	i learned that in univeristy
2016-01-24 11:58:25	cnnx	there's nothing wrong with it if you do it right
2016-01-24 11:58:34	cnnx	but if you mess up you will get segmenation errors
2016-01-24 11:58:41	+zlg	segfaults, weeeeeeee
2016-01-24 11:58:43	+Cheaterman	yeah, but that's kinda hackish, I wouldn't interface that directly with a malloc
2016-01-24 11:58:49	+Cheaterman	exactly zlg
2016-01-24 11:58:53	+Cheaterman	segfaults ftw
2016-01-24 11:58:57	cnnx	so pyhton has no such function?
2016-01-24 11:59:03	cnnx	how does it manage memory ? via the kernel?
2016-01-24 11:59:03	+Cheaterman	cnnx: no
2016-01-24 11:59:05	+zlg	MemoryError
2016-01-24 11:59:09	+Cheaterman	cnnx: with malloc
2016-01-24 11:59:16	+zlg	Or would that be OSError?
2016-01-24 11:59:17	+Cheaterman	CPython is written in C, it uses malloc
2016-01-24 11:59:20	+zlg	IOError?
2016-01-24 11:59:32	+Cheaterman	zlg: probably OSError('Not enough memory.')
2016-01-24 11:59:41	+zlg	Cheaterman: For a segfault?
2016-01-24 11:59:48	+Cheaterman	Oh no
2016-01-24 11:59:51	jwm224	I have a memory leak now... or, something's going on with FIFO and tmp storage.
2016-01-24 11:59:54	+Cheaterman	It just barfs at your face
2016-01-24 11:59:56	+Cheaterman	if you segfault :)
2016-01-24 12:00:01	+zlg	So just like C then
2016-01-24 12:00:02	+Cheaterman	signal 11 and everything
2016-01-24 12:00:03	+zlg	haha
2016-01-24 12:00:06	+Cheaterman	yeah that's what a segfault is ^^

2016-01-24 12:03:21	+wiktor_b	cnnx: sure, but some other op, e.g. one whose name starts with G, might take issue with it next time :)
2016-01-24 12:03:26	+Cheaterman	i have auto reconnect to my bt speaker from laptop, etc
2016-01-24 12:03:41	+Cheaterman	cnnx: yeah, someone whose name starts with G is quite dangerous
2016-01-24 12:03:47	+zlg	Cheaterman: And you got alsa to play nice with that?
2016-01-24 12:03:50	cnnx	griz64? he's nice
2016-01-24 12:04:00	+Cheaterman	zlg: pulseaudio of course, ALSA alone isn't supposed to do that
2016-01-24 12:04:06	+Cheaterman	although I did get ALSA alone to do it too
2016-01-24 12:04:11	+Cheaterman	but you ned to restart the ALSA client
2016-01-24 12:04:18	+Cheaterman	so it's kind of a PITA
2016-01-24 12:04:26	+Cheaterman	with PA you get seamless switching between interfaces
2016-01-24 12:04:28	+zlg	Well, the BT stack is supposed to be able to talk to alsa-lib to tell it about the new device.
2016-01-24 12:04:30	+Cheaterman	without restarting the app :)
2016-01-24 12:04:35	+Cheaterman	yes it can
2016-01-24 12:04:38	+zlg	so naturally alsa clients need restarting so that's no big deal
2016-01-24 12:04:40	+Cheaterman	but your apps won't use it until you ask them
2016-01-24 12:04:43	+Cheaterman	yeah
2016-01-24 12:04:46	+Cheaterman	that just sucks
2016-01-24 12:04:47	+Cheaterman	go PA
2016-01-24 12:04:47	+Cheaterman	:D
2016-01-24 12:04:51	+Cheaterman	also bluez4 does ALSA
2016-01-24 12:04:54	+Cheaterman	bluez5 does PA only
2016-01-24 12:04:56	+zlg	PA's never worked correctly for me.
2016-01-24 12:05:06	+Cheaterman	PA works fine everywhere I install it
2016-01-24 12:05:07	+Cheaterman	go go PA!
2016-01-24 12:05:31	+zlg	Seems like a needless abstraction on top of something that generally just works.
2016-01-24 12:05:34	+wiktor_b	I think PA is the only well-described net audio solution, and since I wanna do net audio at home, I think I'll be stuck with PA
2016-01-24 12:05:56	+Cheaterman	zlg: if you want several audio interfaces and to work with them easily, you just need an audio server
2016-01-24 12:06:03	+Cheaterman	be it PA or anything else
2016-01-24 12:06:06	+zlg	I've only had issues with ALSA when I'm adding new devices or have specific needs with those devices.
2016-01-24 12:06:11	+Cheaterman	exactly
2016-01-24 12:06:14	+Cheaterman	what PA addresses
2016-01-24 12:06:15	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-01-24 12:06:25	+zlg	I'll use JACK before I touch PA again
2016-01-24 12:06:31	+zlg	It produced 20GB of logs once.
2016-01-24 12:06:34	+wiktor_b	hmm, I'm wondering how to do net audio on windows now...
2016-01-24 12:06:38	+Cheaterman	Xorg did that to me as well
2016-01-24 12:06:41	+Cheaterman	I don't hate it though
2016-01-24 12:06:44	+Cheaterman	wiktor_b: PA
2016-01-24 12:06:53	+wiktor_b	zlg: jack and PA do different things
2016-01-24 12:06:59	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: PA on windows?!
2016-01-24 12:07:04	+Cheaterman	That's what they claim yes
2016-01-24 12:07:13	+Cheaterman	So just give it a try
2016-01-24 12:07:19	+zlg	PA was also written by someone who won't stand behind his work and moves onto the next project before stabilizing the first one :)
2016-01-24 12:07:33	+Cheaterman	Poettering is a stupid dude
2016-01-24 12:07:38	+wiktor_b	zlg: indeed
2016-01-24 12:07:39	+Cheaterman	but now that he doesn't work on it anymore, PA is cool
2016-01-24 12:07:40	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-01-24 12:07:41	+zlg	Maintainers end up coming behind him and fixing what he writes.
2016-01-24 12:07:47	+wiktor_b	hmm, time to go to bed
2016-01-24 12:07:47	+wiktor_b	o/
2016-01-24 12:07:58	+Cheaterman	baiii wiktor_b :)
2016-01-24 12:08:05	+wiktor_b	see ya
2016-01-24 12:08:08	+Cheaterman	time to roll a joint owiii
2016-01-24 12:08:10	iamben	wiktor_b: happy birthday
2016-01-24 12:08:10	+Cheaterman	cya wiktor_b bliblibli
2016-01-24 12:08:15	+Cheaterman	iamben: happy birthday!
2016-01-24 12:08:29	+zlg	I might consider PA in a VM some time, if I can ever get a look at how it works.
2016-01-24 12:08:58	cnnx	how do i check which package contains pyinstaller? i never remember, i tried e-file
2016-01-24 12:09:19	+zlg	Oh crap there's an online tool for that.
2016-01-24 12:09:33	+Cheaterman	cnnx: sudo pip install pyinstaller
2016-01-24 12:09:48	+zlg	That seems gross.
2016-01-24 12:10:00	+zlg	It'll work, sure, but why let pip do what portage can do better?
2016-01-24 12:10:09	iamben	zlg: PA just works now and that's part of why people hate it so much
2016-01-24 12:10:10	+Cheaterman	because portage doesn't have pyinstaller
2016-01-24 12:10:18	+Cheaterman	iamben: exactly
2016-01-24 12:10:30	+zlg	iamben: ? I wouldn't have issues with it if it worked.
2016-01-24 12:10:47	iamben	zlg: hah we hear that every day in #gentoo =)
2016-01-24 12:10:48	+zlg	And if it was transparent enough to understand what was going on under the hood.
2016-01-24 12:11:27	+zlg	Last time I tried it was, last year I think. It was when Skype forced PA as a dep and apulse wasn't written yet.

2016-01-24 12:12:11	+Cheaterman	cnnx: you can try that
2016-01-24 12:12:11	cnnx	an overlay is like adding a repository right?
2016-01-24 12:12:15	+zlg	Pretty much

2016-01-24 12:14:52	+Cheaterman	and get some
2016-01-24 12:15:07	+zlg	The local grocery outlet has these Hawaiian onion chips
2016-01-24 12:15:10	+zlg	Things are so nommy.

2016-01-24 12:16:47	iamben	cnnx: mostly due to the VCS clients needed for most overlays, like git
2016-01-24 12:16:59	cnnx	ok
2016-01-24 12:17:04	iamben	jwm224: yeah canned nacho cheese is awesome
2016-01-24 12:17:05	+zlg	You'll want git anyway :)

2016-01-24 12:20:57	jwm224	I mainly need splitdebug for Valgrind to work.
2016-01-24 12:21:24	+zlg	Most profiles already don't have stricter, distcc, or ccache on.
2016-01-24 12:21:35	+zlg	I don't recall splitdebug doing anything bad.
2016-01-24 12:22:24	jwm224	with glibc... Not sure if I had to add those or not. I'll check my make.conf.

2016-01-24 13:19:31	mvaenskae	i will see how it progresses
2016-01-24 13:21:22	dugz	i'm trying to hold out for Zen and Polaris before I make a decision on my next computer. This one still has life in it so I'm not in a big hurry
2016-01-24 13:21:48	mvaenskae	zen/polaris?
2016-01-24 13:21:56	mvaenskae	new gens coming this year?
2016-01-24 13:21:59	dugz	the upcoming AMD cpu+gpu
2016-01-24 13:22:12	mvaenskae	alright, nvidia lost a customer unless this is a pebkac
2016-01-24 13:22:18	dugz	polaris is, not sure about zen because it got delayed
2016-01-24 13:22:25	mvaenskae	i will report further on the development
2016-01-24 13:22:36	mvaenskae	but as of right now i am extremely unhappy with nvidia
2016-01-24 13:22:42	dugz	sleep on it, maybe you can fix it still
2016-01-24 13:23:03	dugz	mvaenskae, did you try turning off the EFI framebuffer?
2016-01-24 13:23:15	mvaenskae	there is NO output on the hard
2016-01-24 13:23:18	mvaenskae	*card
2016-01-24 13:23:32	dugz	oh my
2016-01-24 13:23:39	mvaenskae	that is what is making me furious, it should at least display something
2016-01-24 13:23:56	dugz	yeah like the initial EFI crap
2016-01-24 13:24:37	dugz	wait, qemu can do EFI too?
2016-01-24 13:24:49	mvaenskae	i can try a legacy only installation as well but i doubt it will work, especially as i need to then patch my system iirc
2016-01-24 13:24:54	mvaenskae	yup
2016-01-24 13:26:03	dugz	so when you enable gpu-passthrough you suddenly get a black window
2016-01-24 13:26:20	dugz	hmm
2016-01-24 13:27:12	mvaenskae	i get nothing

2016-01-24 13:27:28	dugz	mvaenskae, could be a problem with the IOMMU maybe
2016-01-24 13:27:49	mvaenskae	iommu should work, i get my groups shown

2016-01-24 13:30:04	dugz	puzzling
2016-01-24 13:33:23	mvaenskae	not puzzling, nvidia i guess
2016-01-24 13:33:48	mvaenskae	as the error 43 is nvidia telling the customer to go cuddle with skunks
2016-01-24 13:34:55	dugz	mvaenskae, i'm reading some stuff but no answers are jumping out at me
2016-01-24 13:35:06	mvaenskae	i did for the past 8ish hours
2016-01-24 13:36:31	mvaenskae	i will either ask around with my buddies if someone had a gpu i can borrow for a moment or i will just wait for the next gpu generation and then enjoy games with amd :)
2016-01-24 13:36:47	dugz	mvaenskae, you need to blacklist the nvidia kernel module on your host
2016-01-24 13:37:03	mvaenskae	i don't have either compiled
2016-01-24 13:37:26	mvaenskae	and included; furthermore, nvidia and grsec are NOT compatible ;)
2016-01-24 13:38:21	mvaenskae	i did my homework so far to really get it passed along with ovmf
2016-01-24 13:38:31	mvaenskae	it's just nvidia being a bundle of sticks
2016-01-24 13:39:12	dugz	remind me never to try what you are doing
2016-01-24 13:39:45	dugz	i think i'd rather write dbus rules
2016-01-24 13:39:49	mvaenskae	eh, if i had a 980 it should have been in a working setup 3 hours ago
2016-01-24 13:39:59	mvaenskae	i found a marvelous script for qemu
2016-01-24 13:40:03	mvaenskae	i will keep it and enhance it

2016-01-24 13:41:50	dugz	i used to use qemu-arm to compile, well, arm systems
2016-01-24 13:42:08	mvaenskae	with this script i might be tempted to give it a test again
2016-01-24 13:42:21	dugz	thats the spirit!

2016-01-24 13:44:08	cnnx	how well does python do graphics ?
2016-01-24 13:44:18	cnnx	in X
2016-01-24 13:44:39	*	mvaenskae wonders how one partitions a logical volume...
2016-01-24 13:45:02	dugz	cnnx, you need some kind of extra lib with Python for graphics
2016-01-24 13:45:18	dugz	mvaenskae, you don't the LV is a partition
2016-01-24 13:45:20	+zlg	Graphics will need SDL if you want 2D
2016-01-24 13:45:33	mvaenskae	oh, i can just use cfdisk on it
2016-01-24 13:45:35	+zlg	For GUI you'll want something that ties into one of the GUI libs, ofc
2016-01-24 13:45:37	cnnx	yeah just 2D is fine
2016-01-24 13:45:51	dugz	pygame used to make for easy 2D graphics too
2016-01-24 13:46:01	+zlg	Pygame is pretty cool.
2016-01-24 13:46:07	cnnx	how can i see it
2016-01-24 13:46:08	+zlg	A friend and I made a platformer prototype in under an hour.
2016-01-24 13:46:11	cnnx	i want to write a game
2016-01-24 13:46:12	mvaenskae	dugz: i would want to have a raw lvm partition that i can put my arm image on
2016-01-24 13:46:12	+zlg	pygame.org
2016-01-24 13:46:24	mvaenskae	and the usually want some sort of partitioning :)
2016-01-24 13:46:27	+zlg	dunno if they support py3 yet
2016-01-24 13:46:32	cnnx	is it hard to have my game put into portage once its done?
2016-01-24 13:46:34	dugz	mvaenskae, that would be an unformatted LV
2016-01-24 13:46:46	+zlg	cnnx: If your game is built sanely, not a problem at all.
2016-01-24 13:46:50	mvaenskae	i have 2 ssds that i use for that ;)
2016-01-24 13:46:51	dugz	mvaenskae, just create one with lvcreate
2016-01-24 13:46:58	mvaenskae	they are old though :(
2016-01-24 13:47:04	cnnx	zlg: is there a submission url/procedure i can look at?
2016-01-24 13:47:28	+zlg	cnnx: Ideally, you'd build your own overlay and make sure it works, following the devmanual.
2016-01-24 13:47:39	+zlg	Once it works, you'd create a bug asking for it to be added to the gentoo repository.
2016-01-24 13:47:49	+zlg	Or talk to a dev and ask if they'd be willing to maintain it for you.
2016-01-24 13:47:58	+zlg	But you'd need a place to publish new versions and stuff like that.
2016-01-24 13:48:04	cnnx	zlg: am I better off just creating it first and worry about that stuff after?
2016-01-24 13:48:12	dugz	sunrise overlay right?
2016-01-24 13:48:17	+zlg	Absolutely. Just build the game and make it work first.
2016-01-24 13:48:23	cnnx	ok
2016-01-24 13:48:26	cnnx	it will be a net game
2016-01-24 13:48:33	cnnx	between 2 players across the internet or lan
2016-01-24 13:48:40	+zlg	Packaging can always be figured out and improved later.
2016-01-24 13:49:33	+zlg	Man,  feels good to get rid of my reddit account.
2016-01-24 13:49:39	+zlg	I wasted so much time on there.
2016-01-24 13:49:39	cnnx	why?
2016-01-24 13:50:48	dugz	i read that each subreddit is its own petty dictatorship
2016-01-24 13:50:58	+zlg	dugz: That's a nice way of putting it.
2016-01-24 13:51:32	+zlg	The part about reddit that sucks is community builders still haven't learned that numbers influence behavior.
2016-01-24 13:52:13	+zlg	A score next to your name, your comments, your submissions, and others' ability to influence that number creates the means for quelling unpopular opinions and groupthink.

2016-01-24 13:53:51	+zlg	I got tired of that environment and left. Pretty clear cut.

2016-01-24 13:56:36	+zlg	Oh, it's not about that, for me. I never really made any friends on Reddit aside from finding my SO. I'd say Animal Crossing was more instrumental to that than Reddit.
2016-01-24 13:57:59	+zlg	Welp, time to do a few chores.
2016-01-24 13:58:44	dugz	drat, bad nausea. heading for the kitchen sink ...

2016-01-24 14:04:04	mvaenskae	dugz: what type of meds?
2016-01-24 14:04:12	mvaenskae	and how have they been in your system?
2016-01-24 14:04:33	mvaenskae	could be that they were all already ingested
2016-01-24 14:05:01	dugz	quaalude, xanax, oxy :P   just kidding. bunch of boring pills

2016-01-24 14:06:42	jwm224	dugz. I just took 2.5mg valuim, 15mg morphine, and 10mg of oxycodine. It's not helping my progress one iota.

2016-01-24 14:07:20	jwm224	i think its oxycodone
2016-01-24 14:07:23	jwm224	yea
2016-01-24 14:07:42	dugz	morphine kinda is oxycodone, or close enough
2016-01-24 14:08:31	dugz	mostly i just heaved up my diabetes pills, but since my dinner went with it, its not a real issue now

2016-01-24 14:11:00	+zlg	I feel a bit better only taking omeprazole.

2016-01-24 14:13:34	jwm224	I wish there was a medication for Asperger's. It keeps me locked in my room for months.
2016-01-24 14:13:52	dugz	i think rottingdead has that jwm224
2016-01-24 14:14:15	jwm224	I never questioned surgury.
2016-01-24 14:14:44	jwm224	The name fits.
2016-01-24 14:15:35	dugz	he's allright, i like to chat with him when i see him, he was real down and out in a bad situation but he said he moved near stores walking distance now and is doing better
2016-01-24 14:15:45	jwm224	My social skills keep me from interacting with people to go eat and sometimes even the bathroom.
2016-01-24 14:16:16	dugz	yeah aspergers would be tough in public, i wouldn't want to go out much
2016-01-24 14:17:31	dugz	i'd be very self conscious and it would make for a bad time
2016-01-24 14:17:45	jwm224	Yeah, I have most trouble looking ppl in the eyes. I like zero in on them and akwardness just sets in, so I usually avoid eye contact altogether.
2016-01-24 14:18:44	+zlg	I have a brother in law who's on the autism spectrum. Likely Asperger's. I can relate to a lot of his troubles. It's not an easy life and he'll have trouble adapting to adult life. It doesn't help that a good portion of the 'social internet' likes to use autism as an insult. Maybe that's just mostly in US-centric communities, though, where mental illness is taboo.
2016-01-24 14:18:52	jwm224	Sometimes when I'm drunk, it works out... It's a little easier.
2016-01-24 14:19:19	+zlg	I don't look people in the eye much, either. I reserve it for people I'm comfortable with and trust.
2016-01-24 14:19:23	+zlg	That list is tiny.
2016-01-24 14:19:26	dugz	sure, drinking removes inhibitions

2016-01-24 14:36:51	dugz	cnnx, idk but did you check out pygame? its easy to use
2016-01-24 14:37:04	cnnx	i'm more at ease with C for now
2016-01-24 14:37:12	cnnx	i would have to start from the begnning in python

2016-01-24 14:39:34	jwm224	dugz: I went thru a tutorial on pygames, programmed side by side.
2016-01-24 14:40:01	dugz	jwm224, I can use pygame to write simple apps
2016-01-24 14:40:28	jwm224	Some one mentioned a screensaver maze that solves itself. I have that code in pygame.
2016-01-24 14:40:51	dugz	i wrote a 3D space sim with pygame
2016-01-24 14:40:58	arvut	jwm224: buy a book, study and don't chat. - best recipe if you wanna learn a language :) (unless you can take a course in that language ofcourse)
2016-01-24 14:41:24	jwm224	I got it off of someone online. I didn't write it myself, but it's impressive.
2016-01-24 14:42:01	dugz	python is pretty easy, if you know C you would have few issues
2016-01-24 14:42:33	jwm224	I have a python book. I gave my cousin my C++ book from college, well leant, but no one returns books. it seems.
2016-01-24 14:43:19	jwm224	True. If you understand C, you can learn any language.
2016-01-24 14:44:57	jwm224	The only thing I really have problems understanding is Assembly, and I said before I'm not an object-oriented classes programmer.
2016-01-24 14:45:41	jwm224	I can grasp it, it just confuses me to a point that I'd rather not.
2016-01-24 14:47:01	jwm224	I have several Linux books too.
2016-01-24 14:48:11	mvaenskae	assembly is mostly just complex in terms of raw data management
2016-01-24 14:48:33	dugz	jwm224, assembly isn't necessarily hard, but it lacks nice features of higher level languages, and its not dense at all, a short assembly program can be pages and pages
2016-01-24 14:48:59	mvaenskae	and singular operations are sometimes difficult to understand (why do we now add %rax and %rbx?)
2016-01-24 14:49:42	mvaenskae	could be a complex mathematical formula's last step, could also just be a simple increment by a constant value that the compiler decided to actually store in register
2016-01-24 14:50:39	mvaenskae	also assembly debugging is usually limited to -O0, the moment you go to -O3 or -Os or even better, non standard you are really asking for extensive understanding of the target architecture

2016-01-24 14:52:10	mvaenskae	knowing the general basics of assembly is great, intricate details here are rarely what helps you create good code though
2016-01-24 14:52:17	 > 	biergaizi (~gaizi@fsf/member/biergaizi) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-01-24 14:53:25	mvaenskae	you need to know it all and not only understand the target architecture but also then the algorithm/code you are writing; changing from an addition to a multiplication or from assigning constant expression to singular increments can already cause more work for you than you get back in saved time from quicker execution
2016-01-24 14:54:22	dugz	I wrote the towers of hanoi in motorola 68000 assembly for one of my college courses. I loved it
2016-01-24 14:54:32	mvaenskae	also proving them being bug free and feature free (oh right, this caused an off-by-one error, my bad D:)  is not always a simple task either :)
2016-01-24 14:55:41	mvaenskae	so all in all knowing assembly is good to understand computers, but to truly master it you need to spend a couple hundred, maybe a few thousand hours with the target architecture, the compiler you are using and the language standard/definition to get something remarkable back in return :)
2016-01-24 14:55:57	mvaenskae	dugz: oh, it finished already? =p

2016-01-24 14:56:43	dugz	its cool to drop from C to assembly by using the asm{ } directive, you can do things like load something in a register and call an interrupt, for instance
2016-01-24 14:57:15	mvaenskae	i haven't yet used the assembly directive
2016-01-24 14:57:32	dugz	thats the easy way to use assembly
2016-01-24 14:57:43	mvaenskae	but then again i did write a compiler in a group of 3 to compile a subset of java to asm :)
2016-01-24 14:58:00	mvaenskae	including inheritance :o
2016-01-24 14:58:07	dugz	whoa there
2016-01-24 14:58:10	catpiggest	mvaenskae, how did that happen?
2016-01-24 14:58:25	mvaenskae	not multiple though, just single
2016-01-24 14:58:52	mvaenskae	introduction to compiler design class
2016-01-24 14:58:59	mvaenskae	there is also the advanced compiler design class
2016-01-24 14:59:07	mvaenskae	i will likely take it in my masters

2016-01-24 15:09:05	mushroomblue	dugz: can you have udev and eudev installed simultaneously

2016-01-24 15:09:16	mvaenskae	ahhhh, it was udev i think
2016-01-24 15:09:36	mvaenskae	systemd integrated udev if memory serves me right :)
2016-01-24 15:09:50	catpiggest	mvaenskae, sorta
2016-01-24 15:09:55	mushroomblue	and gummiboot, didn't they?
2016-01-24 15:10:18	catpiggest	mvaenskae, i have udev installed and active, but systemd not even installed
2016-01-24 15:10:23	mvaenskae	mushroomblue: that is gummiboot =p
2016-01-24 15:10:31	mvaenskae	at least in my books
2016-01-24 15:10:34	dugz	mushroomblue, is mdev the *new way*?
2016-01-24 15:10:42	mushroomblue	I dunno, I just work here.
2016-01-24 15:10:50	mushroomblue	I use eudev on my machine.
2016-01-24 15:11:03	mvaenskae	catpiggest: that is possible but systemd uninstalls udev from my understanding
2016-01-24 15:11:14	catpiggest	mvaenskae, that would make sense
2016-01-24 15:11:29	dugz	never even heard of eudev until just now
2016-01-24 15:11:37	mushroomblue	eudev is the gentoo udev fork.
2016-01-24 15:11:41	catpiggest	dugz, thats because it's called moodev
2016-01-24 15:11:43	mushroomblue	I hadn't heard of mdev until just now. :)
2016-01-24 15:12:08	catpiggest	mushroomblue, i thought mdev wasnt suitable and/or meant for normal desktop systems

2016-01-24 15:14:10	dugz	aha! udev is the unholy offspring of systemd
2016-01-24 15:14:15	mushroomblue	mvaenskae: or, you know, just install JACK.

2016-01-24 15:29:25	+Griz64	hahahaha. liar!
2016-01-24 15:29:30	+Griz64	nice try though! ;-)
2016-01-24 15:29:42	mvaenskae	Griz64: if it doesn't then it's 99.5% pebkac
2016-01-24 15:29:42	catpiggest	more importantly, once you get something to work it generally stays that way
2016-01-24 15:29:43	+Griz64	we've all seen each other curse and moan.
2016-01-24 15:29:56	dugz	catpiggest, i was also a debian worm before i went through my larval stage and emerged a gentoo dude
2016-01-24 15:29:56	mvaenskae	tthe other .5 are issues the other distros also experience ;)
2016-01-24 15:30:32	+Griz64	i use Gentoo because when it doesn't "Just Werk(tm)", i can visit #Gentoo, have a couple of discussions and get it to "Just Werk(tm)".
2016-01-24 15:30:32	catpiggest	dugz, other way round for me, used debian at work
2016-01-24 15:30:43	mvaenskae	Griz64: also that
2016-01-24 15:30:47	catpiggest	Griz64, to be fair, most of my debian problems got fixed here ^^
2016-01-24 15:30:51	mvaenskae	seriously, community is awesome
2016-01-24 15:30:59	+Griz64	*nod*
2016-01-24 15:31:10	+Griz64	that's why i have a 'Bad Name' here.
2016-01-24 15:31:13	mvaenskae	the community is a major reason i am still with you guys
2016-01-24 15:31:31	dugz	the problem with fixing debian bugs, is the next time you run apt-get upgrade, its likely to unfix them all
2016-01-24 15:31:32	mvaenskae	the other is because i like to break stuff =p
2016-01-24 15:31:33	catpiggest	what i like about gentoo is that it has few surprises
2016-01-24 15:31:35	+Griz64	i'm one of those ASCIIhats assigned with KEEPING the community good. ;-)
2016-01-24 15:32:00	mvaenskae	gentoo makes breaking stuff easy
2016-01-24 15:32:14	+Griz64	and correcting it, even MORE fun!
2016-01-24 15:32:24	catpiggest	mvaenskae, exactly. so when something breaks you can actually fix it
2016-01-24 15:32:42	dugz	Griz64, are you a developer or staff?
2016-01-24 15:32:49	catpiggest	in terms of personal abilities i mean
2016-01-24 15:32:58	+Griz64	dugz, negative
2016-01-24 15:33:02	mvaenskae	catpiggest: i could be, but usually i ask everyone else to fix it =p
2016-01-24 15:33:02	mushroomblue	I dunno, how many people use FEATURES="candy" ?
2016-01-24 15:33:07	mushroomblue	that's a surprise. :)

2016-01-24 15:33:11	catpiggest	gentoo taught me more about computer architecture than the computer architecture module ^^

2016-01-24 15:36:36	mushroomblue	no.. that's what candy said during my emerge.

2016-01-26 11:26:16	dugz	FrostFeline, i kind of explained it earler, we just have a tight cap and then enforce it with fees

2016-01-26 11:29:34	+FrostFeline	eh heh
2016-01-26 11:29:48	+zlg	FrostFeline: No excuse for American ISPs to have crap infra. The gov't *paid them* to expand/improve, and they pocketed it.
2016-01-26 11:30:08	dugz	oh i have fiber to the house
2016-01-26 11:30:24	+FrostFeline	What ISP are you using?
2016-01-26 11:30:26	dugz	i can max out my monthly cap in about a day
2016-01-26 11:30:40	+zlg	Monthly caps are so nonsensical.
2016-01-26 11:30:40	dugz	FrostFeline, Armstrong (zoom internet)
2016-01-26 11:30:48	+zlg	Even with wireless carriers there's not much of an argument for them.
2016-01-26 11:31:29	dugz	its just a scheme to get more money
2016-01-26 11:31:29	+FrostFeline	zlg: So the wireless ISPs have enough bandwidth for everyone to start torrenting 24/7 from their phone?
2016-01-26 11:32:02	+FrostFeline	or watching netflix I guess, that's almost as bandwidth heavy
2016-01-26 11:32:03	+zlg	FrostFeline: Do they need to? Odds are no. Even if they did, they should sell what they can handle.
2016-01-26 11:32:27	+zlg	If they can't handle it, then the money they earn needs to go back into the infrastructure. People will pay for better service.
2016-01-26 11:32:44	+FrostFeline	People... paying for things ... :^)
2016-01-26 11:33:12	+zlg	I mean, it's not much of a discussion in the first place since local governments allow monopolies to exist in their cities.
2016-01-26 11:33:33	+zlg	Until it's 100% classified as a utility and companies all work on the same infra, it's really not going to get any better.

2016-01-26 11:34:22	+zlg	Municipal, mostly.
2016-01-26 11:34:38	+FrostFeline	What influence would they have in that situation? I thought radio bandwidth was allocated at the federal level?
2016-01-26 11:35:00	+zlg	I was talking wired ISPs... wireless is a different beast and controlled mostly by the FCC afaik.
2016-01-26 11:35:34	dugz	_anomaly_, I just tested fbgetty and the @image doesn't work

2016-01-26 11:36:08	+FrostFeline	How does a monopoly get them more money?
2016-01-26 11:36:23	+zlg	Company A comes in, tells the city they'll build infra, infra will attract business, which means more consumers and more tax dollars. They'll pay them *more* if they forbid other ISPs from operating there.
2016-01-26 11:36:29	+zlg	Boom, done.

2016-01-26 11:36:54	+zlg	It's the same song and dance as any other politics; it eventually boils down to money.
2016-01-26 11:37:18	_anomaly_	dugz: *shrug*
2016-01-26 11:37:22	+FrostFeline	Is there any churn in american ISPs?
2016-01-26 11:37:25	+zlg	I mean, why else would you reduce choice and competition?
2016-01-26 11:37:29	_anomaly_	i use fbcon and a normal getty

2016-01-26 11:37:34	+zlg	FrostFeline: Very little, highly dependent on where you are.
2016-01-26 11:37:37	_anomaly_	er
2016-01-26 11:37:39	_anomaly_	fbcondecor
2016-01-26 11:37:40	+FrostFeline	Do we still have the same ones from 1980?
2016-01-26 11:37:42	dugz	_anomaly_, hey I might be able to do it!
2016-01-26 11:37:43	+FrostFeline	oh
2016-01-26 11:38:01	_anomaly_	i've had some pretty sweet fbcondecor themes in the past
2016-01-26 11:38:01	+zlg	AT&T got broke up, but I think that was only in the phone/cable space and not ISP.
2016-01-26 11:38:04	_anomaly_	wish i still had them
2016-01-26 11:38:47	+zlg	These days it's Xfinity/Comcast, FiOS/Verizon, Uverse or other AT&T stuff, and smaller players like Shentel, Charter, Qwest, etc.
2016-01-26 11:39:15	+FrostFeline	Would these smaller ISPs have been affected by the subsidies on internet infrastructure?
2016-01-26 11:39:22	+zlg	But generally, the location of your home dictates which ISP you have access to, even in a city that has good options, sometimes.
2016-01-26 11:39:36	+zlg	Your HOA may have made a deal with one specific ISP, or only one or two ISPs serve your area.
2016-01-26 11:39:47	+FrostFeline	These smaller ISPs could be being gouged by their backbone providers
2016-01-26 11:39:53	+zlg	FrostFeline: They might've been paid less since their infra was smaller? No clue tbh.
2016-01-26 11:40:01	+zlg	That too.
2016-01-26 11:40:20	+zlg	From what I gather there's not a lot of regulation in the ISP space aside from the pole and pedestal codes, zoning, crap like that.
2016-01-26 11:40:42	+zlg	And that just relates to how the infra is built, not necessarily where it's built.
2016-01-26 11:41:24	+zlg	Google's mixing things up a little in the markets they enter.

2016-02-07 08:18:40	+zlg	so `read` is reading stdout. But in that context I think it's trying to read something that's not there
2016-02-07 08:19:00	+zlg	looks like stdin is fd 0
2016-02-07 08:19:08	+Smiley	ah ok
2016-02-07 08:19:11	+zlg	so replace `while read -r 1` with a 0

2016-02-07 08:19:29	+Smiley	erm, it's an l I think?

2016-02-07 08:20:32	+Smiley	should we not just try read?
2016-02-07 08:20:40	+zlg	read -r could be good enough, yeah
2016-02-07 08:20:49	+zlg	since xscreensaver's output is being piped to it in the first place
2016-02-07 08:20:53	+Smiley	./lockScreen: line 14: read: `0': not a valid identifier
2016-02-07 08:20:56	+zlg	and read -r 0 is kinda redundant

2016-02-07 08:23:16	+Smiley	still doesn't 'background/disown' the job

2016-02-07 08:23:36	+eroen	blibli
2016-02-07 08:23:40	+hosler	do it
2016-02-07 08:23:43	+zlg	Smiley: So it runs, but doesn't background?
2016-02-07 08:23:50	+eroen	hosler: I don't woo
2016-02-07 08:23:54	+hosler	do ittt

2016-02-07 08:24:03	+hosler	wooo

2016-02-07 08:24:09	+hosler	doooo iitt
2016-02-07 08:24:12	+Smiley	& should make it background right?
2016-02-07 08:24:13	+eroen	pa-choo
2016-02-07 08:24:18	+Smiley	hm,mm maybe redirect it to null too :D
2016-02-07 08:24:33	+zlg	& backgrounds a process, yes
2016-02-07 08:24:41	+zlg	redirecting won't do anything unless you care about the text stream
2016-02-07 08:24:47	+zlg	Sec, I'm working on a gist
2016-02-07 08:24:49	+Smiley	I don't
2016-02-07 08:24:55	+Smiley	but I'm confused to why it doesn't seem to background
2016-02-07 08:25:25	+zlg	Ugh, Gist, why you gotta be retarded and not work with it's all text!?
2016-02-07 08:25:33	+zlg	Vim it is

2016-02-07 08:30:37	+zlg	Smiley: First off, I was wrong about removing the lowercase L. That's the variable you're testing against in the if statement.
2016-02-07 08:30:53	+zlg	read will take its stdin and put each line into the variable you specify
2016-02-07 08:30:55	+zlg	So that was fine
2016-02-07 08:34:12	+Smiley	actually
2016-02-07 08:34:14	+Cheaterman	eroen: xD
2016-02-07 08:34:16	+Smiley	ckb does disconnect
2016-02-07 08:34:20	+Smiley	the script never finishes!
2016-02-07 08:34:21	+FrostFeline	Not sure why apple thought it would be a good idea to make the mac pro a trash can
2016-02-07 08:34:45	+FrostFeline	As opposed to a normal ATX computer
2016-02-07 08:34:55	+zlg	Smiley: Oh, so it's backgrounding? Good
2016-02-07 08:35:10	+zlg	I had to figure out what ckb actually was, haha
2016-02-07 08:35:12	+Smiley	yup just noticed when I hit ctrl z
2016-02-07 08:35:17	+Smiley	ckb continues running, it's just the script
2016-02-07 08:35:21	+Smiley	zlg: lol should of asked
2016-02-07 08:35:29	+Smiley	                        then /usr/bin/ckb --background &
2016-02-07 08:35:29	+Smiley	                        break
2016-02-07 08:35:31	+Smiley	So that works
2016-02-07 08:35:37	+Smiley	it maybe doesnt' break out?
2016-02-07 08:35:56	+hosler	dump to nulllll
2016-02-07 08:36:03	+zlg	Right, it's not breaking.
2016-02-07 08:36:30	+Smiley	hosler: and eventually run outta pid's XD
2016-02-07 08:36:37	+hosler	you wont

2016-02-07 08:37:09	+zlg	Assuming your background command is on its own line with just & at the end, no ;, and the same for break (just 'break' on the line), try putting ';;' on the line below break, before 'fi'
2016-02-07 08:37:21	+zlg	And make sure 'fi' doesn't have a ; at the end either
2016-02-07 08:37:45	+zlg	You generally don't need ;; except in switch/cases

2016-02-07 08:39:59	+zlg	hmmm
2016-02-07 08:40:06	+zlg	I'd just remove the ;; line, then.
2016-02-07 08:40:16	+zlg	I really don't see why it wouldn't break out of the while loop

2016-02-07 08:41:38	+zlg	no no no. the -r flag to read is important, since it makes it not escape things. the identifier is important, too, because it passes that information to the variable.
2016-02-07 08:41:47	+zlg	How that works for you, I have no idea.

2016-02-07 08:42:32	+zlg	On line 16 I'd change that = to a ==, even though bash treats them the same way

2016-02-07 09:01:11	+zlg	I'm still not sure how ckb is running in that if statement, since you didn't define REPLY anywhere.
2016-02-07 09:01:15	+zlg	Unless `read` is setting it for you
2016-02-07 09:01:30	+Smiley	yup
2016-02-07 09:01:34	+Smiley	it's build in for read
2016-02-07 09:01:38	+zlg	cool
2016-02-07 09:02:18	+zlg	The only thing I can think of here is something is blocking.
2016-02-07 09:02:28	+zlg	`read` is taking xscreensaver-commands output as its input
2016-02-07 09:02:36	+zlg	What causes xscreensaver-command -watch to exit?
2016-02-07 09:02:52	+zlg	If it's not exiting, the script will continue to read

2016-02-07 09:05:53	+zlg	So that Perl script is actually kind of a bad idea
2016-02-07 09:06:08	+zlg	If you have no reason to watch xscreensaver, no need to keep the process running.

2016-02-07 09:06:23	+zlg	In fact, each time that perl script is run, it'd be another process watching xscreensaver

2016-02-07 09:16:08	+zlg	Okay. We have two approaches for ckb
2016-02-07 09:16:37	+zlg	One is to prepend 'nohup' to it; the other is to background and then disown so it basically ****s off and leaves us alone.
2016-02-07 09:16:40	+zlg	I'll modify your gist
2016-02-07 09:17:49	+Smiley	welll disown was what I was going for with &
2016-02-07 09:17:53	+Smiley	but we can nohup too , that' works
2016-02-07 09:18:21	+zlg	Well, & is merely the same as loading it and hitting Ctrl-Z.
2016-02-07 09:18:31	+zlg	At that point, it's a background job and you can bring it back with 'fg'
2016-02-07 09:18:48	+zlg	You have to disown it entirely if you want it to leave you alone and/or not close at the end of a terminal sessian

2016-02-07 09:27:33	+zlg	best case scenario is tinyurl or some other service
2016-02-07 09:27:36	+Cheaterman	i received it here anyways :p
2016-02-07 09:27:57	+Cheaterman	hence "back to sender"
2016-02-07 09:28:00	+zlg	Smiley: Glad we solved the problem :D
2016-02-07 09:29:03	+Cheaterman	Oh but catpig might have had it tinyurl'd indeed, can't see it in my logz
2016-02-07 09:29:09	+Smiley	sweeeeeet
2016-02-07 09:29:13	+zlg	Although, honestly we shouldn't have to kill xscreensaver-command
2016-02-07 09:29:19	+mvaenskae	personally i don't mind urls with bad words in them
2016-02-07 09:29:22	+zlg	The dang while loop should listen to the break
2016-02-07 09:29:24	+Cheaterman	And apparently I've been asked to tinyurl it last time I posted it >__> me not good
2016-02-07 09:29:40	+Cheaterman	mvaenskae: if it happened in a youtube url it would be different i suppose :)
2016-02-07 09:29:55	+Cheaterman	bad words in random strings are funni
2016-02-07 09:30:20	+zlg	Well, that's what happens when you apply arbitrary, conservative social mores to things outside your control.
2016-02-07 09:30:23	*	zlg shrugs.
2016-02-07 09:30:25	+Cheaterman	nonetheless, awesome mix, check it out if you like electro swing and dnb
2016-02-07 09:30:27	+mvaenskae	i am quite certain that yt has an algo that actually censors bad words

2016-02-07 09:31:03	+zlg	I got banned from GameFAQs once because my Golden Sun 1 migration code (which was an awesome file with great items) had "g A y" in it.
2016-02-07 09:31:07	+zlg	Not kidding.
2016-02-07 09:31:13	+Cheaterman	Smiley: my rave party looks less funni now

2016-02-07 09:31:40	+zlg	Cheaterman: Right?
2016-02-07 09:31:44	+Cheaterman	arbitrary mods
2016-02-07 09:31:48	+Cheaterman	fortunately we don't have that here
2016-02-07 09:31:55	+mvaenskae	zlg: good to know where not to go anymore :)
2016-02-07 09:32:02	+zlg	No, just arbitrary rules, like most other places :p
2016-02-07 09:32:07	+Cheaterman	just rules that are kinda excessive :) but mods enforcing them are generally cool
2016-02-07 09:32:15	+zlg	mvaenskae: Yeah. I had some good times on GameFAQs before it became a big deal
2016-02-07 09:32:22	+zlg	read: CJayC selling out

2016-02-07 09:33:01	+zlg	GameFAQs was sold to CBS for something like 4 million?
2016-02-07 09:33:05	+zlg	Maybe more.
2016-02-07 09:33:10	+zlg	Back in 2005 or so.
2016-02-07 09:33:13	+Cheaterman	CBS must have loved it
2016-02-07 09:33:14	+zlg	Er, Cnet
2016-02-07 09:33:16	+mvaenskae	isn't cbs a television company?
2016-02-07 09:33:19	+zlg	Cnet then was bought by CBS
2016-02-07 09:33:25	+Cheaterman	I think so mvaenskae
2016-02-07 09:33:28	+mvaenskae	lol, cnet
2016-02-07 09:33:32	+mvaenskae	that is even wrose

2016-02-07 09:33:37	+Cheaterman	wrose yes
2016-02-07 09:33:38	+Cheaterman	much wrose
2016-02-07 09:33:41	+Cheaterman	:D
2016-02-07 09:33:43	+mvaenskae	so bad, it makes me make typos
2016-02-07 09:33:55	+zlg	I miss when the Web was 'small-time'
2016-02-07 09:33:59	+zlg	Lots of independent sites.
2016-02-07 09:34:03	+zlg	Webrings, topsites...
2016-02-07 09:34:09	+zlg	Most of it cringey, but fun
2016-02-07 09:34:16	+mvaenskae	there is still the onion-net
2016-02-07 09:34:24	+zlg	I suck at Tor-ing
2016-02-07 09:34:34	+zlg	and apparently the US govt can bypass it
2016-02-07 09:34:46	+mvaenskae	not 100%
2016-02-07 09:34:58	+mvaenskae	at least not with extensive powers
2016-02-07 09:35:09	+FrostFeline	It's fairly simple if you run a bunch of tor nodes
2016-02-07 09:35:22	+mvaenskae	you gotta own around 50% of the exit nodes i believe to start some form of attack
2016-02-07 09:35:25	+mvaenskae	and the more you own the better
2016-02-07 09:35:28	+zlg	It's probably the same issue as other federated or distributed systems: it's all in trusting your exit node
2016-02-07 09:35:45	+FrostFeline	or you could compromise the server software.
2016-02-07 09:35:51	+FrostFeline	or the client software
2016-02-07 09:35:56	+zlg	That's honestly an easier vector than Tor itself
2016-02-07 09:35:59	+FrostFeline	(the stuff that you're tunneling over tor)
2016-02-07 09:36:05	+hosler	cookies still exist for tracking
2016-02-07 09:36:11	+hosler	tor is useless
2016-02-07 09:36:39	+FrostFeline	No more useless than any socks proxy
2016-02-07 09:36:45	+zlg	Well, ideally you wouldn't use tor for anything that you would *want* traced, i.e. login names, etc
2016-02-07 09:36:45	+hosler	right
2016-02-07 09:37:21	+zlg	That reminds me...
2016-02-07 09:37:30	+zlg	Does anyone here have a puush.me account?
2016-02-07 09:37:45	+zlg	I read their terms and I'm okay with them, but I want to make sure I have the option to delete my account and couldn't find any info on it.
2016-02-07 09:37:53	+zlg	Nobody was responding in IRC for over 6 hours...
2016-02-07 09:38:03	+zlg	Couldn't find any information on it
2016-02-07 09:38:21	+mvaenskae	zlg: assume your data is getting backed up ;)

2016-02-07 09:39:05	+zlg	But use a nice-n-easy script to do it
2016-02-07 09:39:10	+FrostFeline	I use imgur/dropbox, personally

2016-02-07 09:40:41	+zlg	Isn't it also proprietary software?

2016-02-07 09:41:47	brushdemon	interesting, I just did a fresh install in a vm, go to compile my kernel and apparently bc is missing (after installing genkernel)
2016-02-07 09:41:54	brushdemon	guess it's a dependency that's missing for the package

2016-02-07 09:43:47	+zlg	I get bothered by 10
2016-02-07 09:43:47	brushdemon	then it lists PATH

2016-02-07 09:44:05	+FrostFeline	That's an interesting firefox extension
2016-02-07 09:44:08	brushdemon	literally none
2016-02-07 09:44:08	+zlg	iirc bc is an explicit dependency of the kernel
2016-02-07 09:44:19	+zlg	FrostFeline: tree style tabs.
2016-02-07 09:44:22	+FrostFeline	They changed the firefox menu to look like chrome.
2016-02-07 09:44:27	+FrostFeline	Menu button*
2016-02-07 09:44:34	+zlg	I honestly don't like the gray look, but it's the best of what they offered.
2016-02-07 09:44:41	+zlg	Yeah, I don't like the UI changes.
2016-02-07 09:44:51	+mvaenskae	genkernel is at least missing bc if it is supposed to be installed

2016-02-07 09:45:09	+Cheaterman	1294
2016-02-07 09:45:09	brushdemon	it's just a missing dependency for genkernel on fresh installs
2016-02-07 09:45:11	+Cheaterman	just counted them
2016-02-07 09:45:34	+zlg	Cheaterman: There are these neat things called "bookmarks"
2016-02-07 09:45:37	+FrostFeline	I used to use a theme for firefox called abstract blue.
2016-02-07 09:45:39	+zlg	:P
2016-02-07 09:45:39	+Cheaterman	i hate them
2016-02-07 09:45:42	+Cheaterman	i prefer tabs :)
2016-02-07 09:45:45	+Cheaterman	easier to look up
2016-02-07 09:45:56	+zlg	vimperator makes it all irrelevant.

2016-02-07 09:46:11	+zlg	haha
2016-02-07 09:46:16	+Cheaterman	fair point, but I use tabs
2016-02-07 09:46:18	+Cheaterman	FrostFeline: only 8
2016-02-07 09:46:26	+zlg	I have 16 GB and rarely use more than 2 GB
2016-02-07 09:46:27	+Cheaterman	and it was slower with only 4 but not unusable
2016-02-07 09:46:29	+zlg	<_<;
2016-02-07 09:46:29	+FrostFeline	he's using ram pages as bookmarks
2016-02-07 09:46:44	+Cheaterman	don't forget disk space :)
2016-02-07 09:46:52	+mvaenskae	brushdemon: maybe also ask in #gentoo?
2016-02-07 09:47:04	+FrostFeline	zlg: So, like chrome, but with no extensions ;)
2016-02-07 09:47:05	+mvaenskae	there might be someone who knows what the reason could be
2016-02-07 09:47:37	+zlg	Even right now, playing a YT vid, browser with a bunch of tabs, spacefm, geeqie, Skype, transmission, fluxbox, urxvt and a few tmux sessions...
2016-02-07 09:47:40	+zlg	Not even 1.2 GB
2016-02-07 09:48:04	+Cheaterman	my Firefox takes 2200MiB
2016-02-07 09:48:08	+Cheaterman	but he wasn't restarted in a while
2016-02-07 09:48:14	+zlg	Jeez
2016-02-07 09:48:14	+Cheaterman	whole system is 2900MiB
2016-02-07 09:48:28	+Cheaterman	keep in mind he has 1300 tabs loaded
2016-02-07 09:48:29	+zlg	I've not seen Firefox use a bunch of RAM in a long time
2016-02-07 09:48:40	+zlg	But yeah, 1300 tabs is insane
2016-02-07 09:48:59	+FrostFeline	Well fragmentation is always going to be a factor for firefox.
2016-02-07 09:49:05	+FrostFeline	At least until electrolysis

2016-02-07 09:49:29	+zlg	I can see that

2016-02-07 09:49:44	+mvaenskae	ff uses for opengl a new thread since 44 iirc
2016-02-07 09:49:48	+zlg	Better for security, worse for RAM usage and extensions.
2016-02-07 09:50:03	+FrostFeline	I'm not sure what you mean by worse for extensions.
2016-02-07 09:50:24	+zlg	Chrome extensions can't do the same things Firefox extensions can.

2016-02-07 09:50:54	+zlg	Adblocking is worse, Request Policy likely isn't even possible, the UI is probably immutable, etc.
2016-02-07 09:50:54	+mvaenskae	firefox is slowly merging with chrome-functionality though
2016-02-07 09:51:04	+zlg	mvaenskae: And that's one of the worst decisions they're making.
2016-02-07 09:51:09	+mvaenskae	zlg: ublock origin is quite nice
2016-02-07 09:51:23	+zlg	The new extension system will be killing off a lot of Firefox extensions that likely won't be possible in the new system
2016-02-07 09:51:25	+FrostFeline	I'm not familiar with it
2016-02-07 09:51:26	+zlg	Like downthemall
2016-02-07 09:51:34	+zlg	mvaenskae: It is; I use it in Firefox.
2016-02-07 09:51:36	arvut	they are both merging with eachother, its the normal copying of ideas between projects
2016-02-07 09:51:40	+mvaenskae	zlg: i never implied it being a good idea :)
2016-02-07 09:51:44	+zlg	mvaenskae: :)
2016-02-07 09:51:47	+FrostFeline	Why wouldn't downthemall be possible in chrome?
2016-02-07 09:51:59	+FrostFeline	At least chrono comes close to matching it iirc
2016-02-07 09:52:07	+zlg	FrostFeline: I don't know, I don't develop it.
2016-02-07 09:52:35	+FrostFeline	but more importantly, wouldn't what can and can't be done in the browser be a matter of what APIs the designers decided to implement?
2016-02-07 09:52:36	+zlg	But dtA's developer wrote to Mozilla with his concerns over the new extension system for Fx and how it'd be gimping dta
2016-02-07 09:52:52	*	mvaenskae wonders how much longer for llvm to take over as a compiler alternative to gcc
2016-02-07 09:53:25	+zlg	FrostFeline: Exactly. And cutting down the API for, say, UI customization in the interest of 'security' is total BS.
2016-02-07 09:53:39	+FrostFeline	Security isn't BS though
2016-02-07 09:53:47	+Cheaterman	The only one who could ever reach me was the son of a preacher man!!!! \o/
2016-02-07 09:53:50	+mvaenskae	FrostFeline: if api calls used inside the browser cannot be done anymore in the new system that were necessary for core functionality then it does kinda matter :)
2016-02-07 09:54:05	+FrostFeline	I never said it doesn't matter.
2016-02-07 09:54:22	+FrostFeline	But I think not getting exploited is a touch more important than having a shiny widget in your browser
2016-02-07 09:54:23	MattiMo	maybe they are trying to guard against phishing extensions?
2016-02-07 09:54:24	+zlg	You're right, security isn't BS. But whose fault is it that you install a malicious extension: the malware writer or the browser?
2016-02-07 09:54:40	+Cheaterman	getting exploited is awesome ^__^
2016-02-07 09:54:42	+zlg	Just because some parts of the API can be misused doesn't mean those parts should be removed.

2016-02-07 09:54:51	+FrostFeline	zlg: Most people aren't technical enough to make the distinction.

2016-02-07 09:55:23	+zlg	FrostFeline: Firefox tends to ask if you want to install an extension. There are options, iirc, to install only signed or trusted extensions, too.
2016-02-07 09:55:30	+mvaenskae	power users will not like that

2016-02-07 09:55:53	MattiMo	if a user gets exploited using firefox even if it's there fault
2016-02-07 09:55:56	MattiMo	it looks bad for mozilla
2016-02-07 09:56:16	MattiMo	the browser wars are tight
2016-02-07 09:56:28	+zlg	At some point, it becomes users not wanting to be responsible for their poor decisions.
2016-02-07 09:56:29	+Cheaterman	browser wars suck :-(
2016-02-07 09:56:31	+Cheaterman	why not all be friends :-(
2016-02-07 09:56:44	+zlg	I mean on one hand, it shouldn't be possible to gank your system via a simple link or extension.
2016-02-07 09:56:46	+Cheaterman	zlg: and on computers, that's a fact
2016-02-07 09:56:57	+mvaenskae	zlg: that point has been reached long ago
2016-02-07 09:57:03	+zlg	On the other, people who know what they're doing shouldn't be hamstringed.
2016-02-07 09:57:20	+mvaenskae	sadly very very few feel responsible if they fish something up
2016-02-07 09:57:31	MattiMo	ya there should be an 'Extended API' checkbox or something
2016-02-07 09:57:38	+zlg	MattiMo: I'd be okay with that.
2016-02-07 09:57:49	+mvaenskae	they think computers are a magic box that is too difficult to understand
2016-02-07 09:57:49	+zlg	Disabling stuff by default that you have to dig for? Sure, it's inconvenient.
2016-02-07 09:57:50	+Cheaterman	there should be something like android's permissions system
2016-02-07 09:57:51	+zlg	But at least it's there
2016-02-07 09:57:51	 > 	tomboy65 (~tomboy64@unaffiliated/tomboy64) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-02-07 09:57:56	+Cheaterman	so a whole list of the bad things an app can do to you
2016-02-07 09:58:01	+Cheaterman	but nobody reads it
2016-02-07 09:58:01	+mvaenskae	honestly, i am more impressed how computers actually manage to work
2016-02-07 09:58:06	+Cheaterman	so you're legally warned
2016-02-07 09:58:09	+zlg	mvaenskae: Right. And they get catered to by people who take advantage of that ignorance.
2016-02-07 09:58:22	+zlg	Then get mad when they inevitably get taken advantage of.
2016-02-07 09:58:27	+FrostFeline	zlg: I think that's fair
2016-02-07 09:58:42	+mvaenskae	the universe will always be a devs nightmare
2016-02-07 09:58:44	+Cheaterman	that's not just computers, that's how life works
2016-02-07 09:58:46	+Cheaterman	kinda sucks btw
2016-02-07 09:58:54	+FrostFeline	zlg: Nobody expects you to be a mechanic, so why would you expect people to be computer experts
2016-02-07 09:59:01	+FrostFeline	(wrt ignorant mainstream)
2016-02-07 09:59:02	MattiMo	personally I wish there was a version of chrome or firefox that didnt take up half my ram :D
2016-02-07 09:59:03	+mvaenskae	he tries making the system more fool proof, the universe creates an even foolier fool
2016-02-07 09:59:12	+mvaenskae	it
2016-02-07 09:59:14	+Cheaterman	MattiMo: try mine
2016-02-07 09:59:19	+mvaenskae	it's an everlasting struggle
2016-02-07 09:59:25	+FrostFeline	Life is full of specialized professions, and to someone else you're part of the ignorant mainstream.
2016-02-07 09:59:26	+Cheaterman	got 1300 tabs and uses like 35%
2016-02-07 09:59:28	+zlg	FrostFeline: you don't have to be an expert, but being careful in your browser is like putting on your seatbelt; it's just a good idea
2016-02-07 09:59:31	+mvaenskae	the only system that is fool proof is a computer that doesn't turn on
2016-02-07 09:59:42	MattiMo	Cheaterman: what it's called?
2016-02-07 09:59:51	Guest69760	Oo@1300 tabs
2016-02-07 09:59:52	+FrostFeline	being careful in your browser is a lot more complicated than putting on a seatbelt, zlg

2016-02-07 10:01:00	+mvaenskae	Smiley: once they build a miniature compiler with which they build then the new gcc version and then build with that gcc version the version again and compare functionality
2016-02-07 10:01:03	+zlg	Cheaterman: agreed
2016-02-07 10:01:09	+mvaenskae	if the two gcc versions match then it's all right
2016-02-07 10:01:31	+zlg	brb

2016-02-07 10:02:30	+Cheaterman	if you cut anything it's power really
2016-02-07 10:02:33	+FrostFeline	I suppose you could always use something like surf
2016-02-07 10:02:36	+Cheaterman	network isn't such an issue
2016-02-07 10:02:54	+zlg	FrostFeline: Isn't surf just a webkit wrapper?
2016-02-07 10:03:01	+zlg	Useless without some means to control its behavior
2016-02-07 10:03:06	+FrostFeline	Yes, it's a minimal browser

2016-02-07 10:03:30	+zlg	I mean, I'm even fine with scripting it yourself, like uzbl

2016-02-07 10:05:17	+zlg	FrostFeline: Looks like Chrome didn't have anything close to the API until around 2012... and apparently still no comparable analog
2016-02-07 10:05:27	+Cheaterman	what if I roll another one \o/

2016-02-07 10:06:10	+mvaenskae	i am using chromium and am quite happy with it
2016-02-07 10:06:19	+mvaenskae	it performs quick
2016-02-07 10:06:33	+mvaenskae	and chromium, not chrome
2016-02-07 10:06:36	+FrostFeline	I use chrome because of the tab sync, no-one else had that at the time I switched
2016-02-07 10:06:46	Guest69760	I wish that arch version of firefox where the cut all the tracking was ported to gentoo.
2016-02-07 10:06:54	+mvaenskae	and still noone has it quite as good as google
2016-02-07 10:07:16	+FrostFeline	That's because google has an army of programmers and billions of dollars.
2016-02-07 10:07:25	+zlg	Guest69760: The very little tracking I'm aware of is the stuff like "block known tracking sites" and stuff that you can turn off.
2016-02-07 10:07:26	+mvaenskae	and the server architecture
2016-02-07 10:07:31	Tear	surf here too
2016-02-07 10:07:41	Guest69760	zlg: tracking in the wider sense
2016-02-07 10:07:46	+FrostFeline	Not sure what the server arch has to do with a web client
2016-02-07 10:07:51	Guest69760	zlg: have you seen that arch page ?
2016-02-07 10:07:57	+zlg	Guest69760: No?
2016-02-07 10:08:10	+FrostFeline	You could always sync history/tab data over a service like dropbox if so inclined
2016-02-07 10:08:13	+zlg	I left Arch 4 years ago
2016-02-07 10:08:59	+zlg	Guest69760: If you have it handy I'd be willing to check it out.
2016-02-07 10:09:45	Guest69760	zlg: your neurons will explode into a million pieces...

2016-02-08 18:43:53	satmd	this isn't probably related to gentoo itself, but I just woke up to some production servers misbehaving and I lack the knowledge

2016-02-08 18:48:55	deux3xmachina	If it's having trouble writing to a file, it could be a problem were the fs went read-only.
2016-02-08 18:49:20	deux3xmachina	Or maybe the unit file just doesn't get run with the proper permissions?

2016-02-08 20:29:46	SpaceToast	damex: 'find' is a part of GNU findutils (https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/), I'm not aware of them using travis for their CI
2016-02-08 20:30:25	damex	SpaceToast, i mean travis-ci have public CI and there is some utilities present by default out of box...

2016-02-08 20:33:06	SpaceToast	damex: considering it's part of findutils and travis uses ubuntu precise by default it should be in there. And even if it isn't, you can simply install it using apt as part of your CI procedure
2016-02-08 20:33:06	+Chainsaw	dugz: If you tell it to, yes.
2016-02-08 20:33:07	+willikins	Chainsaw, you have notes! [Feb- 5 23:47] <Smiley> wondering if you know how to make ckb turn off the leds on demand via commandline at all.
2016-02-08 20:33:23	damex	SpaceToast, the thing is - i'd prefer complete default
2016-02-08 20:33:37	SpaceToast	damex: 1. why? 2. why not verify?
2016-02-08 20:33:41	+Chainsaw	Smiley: I haven't actually used ckb with my Corsair keyboard at all. It's in plain USB HID mode.
2016-02-08 20:34:21	damex	SpaceToast, why not verify what? if it is available? i have to push commit with travis config first...
2016-02-08 20:34:31	Tear	maybe i should just stop trying to use the apparently crappy oggenc
2016-02-08 20:34:34	damex	i will take some time to complete here
2016-02-08 20:34:38	Tear	and use sox instead

2016-02-08 20:37:27	dugz	whew ok, rsync++

2016-02-08 21:51:37	dugz	I used to know a BBS sysop that used Machinegun as a handle. His system ran on an Amiga

2016-02-08 21:51:47	+xiaomiao	so in theory they could build that
2016-02-08 21:52:13	+Chainsaw	I could do with 32 cores per socket.

2016-02-08 23:39:56	+zlg	I've not drank in a while, so I'm a little lightweight. That's okay though. I hold my liquor wel.
2016-02-08 23:40:19	+zlg	I wonder if I've hit the Ballmer Peak yet.
2016-02-08 23:40:49	+Chainsaw	zlg: Probably overshot it.
2016-02-08 23:40:53	+zlg	Chainsaw: haha
2016-02-08 23:41:01	+zlg	Maybe.
2016-02-08 23:41:13	+zlg	But comments make it all better, right? :P
2016-02-08 23:41:34	+zlg	"this stupid function didn't want to work, so I wrote a million 'printf's and 'assert's
2016-02-08 23:42:20	+zlg	For real, though. I should really finish the K&R so I can start exploring some C libraries.
2016-02-08 23:42:48	+zlg	I like that C is small and simple.
2016-02-08 23:42:57	+zlg	But it gives you plenty of rope with which to hang yoruself.
2016-02-08 23:43:41	dugz	C is just a fancy assembler :D
2016-02-08 23:43:48	+zlg	dugz: That's okay :D
2016-02-08 23:44:03	+Chainsaw	dugz: More portable than assembler :)
2016-02-08 23:44:15	+zlg	Once I realized how dumb PHP is, I felt a need to understand lower level programming.
2016-02-08 23:44:23	+xiaomiao	when it came out people complained how bloated it was
2016-02-08 23:44:33	+zlg	When you know how things work from the metal up, I think it makes you a better programmer.
2016-02-08 23:45:33	+zlg	And even if I can't find a job programming right now.. It's at least fun to build things that work. That feeling is pretty encouraging.
2016-02-08 23:46:33	dugz	do some bux fixing on gentoo bugzilla
2016-02-08 23:46:48	+zlg	I fixed a bug yesterday, as a matter of fact.
2016-02-08 23:46:55	dugz	nice
2016-02-08 23:47:04	+zlg	dev-tcltk/tcllib was conflicting with x11-wm/pager for /usr/bin/page
2016-02-08 23:47:21	+zlg	So I wrote a patch for page's ebuild to rename it to pagewm
2016-02-08 23:47:45	+zlg	Since tcllib's 'page' is a parser generator and... well, kinda more important than a window manager.
2016-02-08 23:48:02	+zlg	It's the stdlib for tcl so it can't really afford to have its name moved around.
2016-02-08 23:48:12	+zlg	But it's annoying that packages want such generic names.
2016-02-08 23:48:19	+zlg	We'll see if the maintainer accepts my patch.
2016-02-08 23:48:30	+zlg	I did all the work for him when I didn't have to, so *shrug*
2016-02-08 23:48:40	+zlg	It was a good exercise.

2016-02-09 00:15:17	Tear	i thought wildcards don't work in quotes

2016-02-09 00:17:27	+zlg	I have a backup script that calls rsync, and I use an include file
2016-02-09 00:17:45	+zlg	It has *s in it, so I assume rsync will accept * in path arguments
2016-02-09 00:18:13	dugz	ok it works only without quotes
2016-02-09 00:20:16	Tear	TIL the project lead of mpv was hired by plex

2016-02-09 00:56:28	gentwo1	and speaking...
2016-02-09 00:56:42	+xiaomiao	gentwo1: there's some random useflag changes ... that looks confusing
2016-02-09 00:56:57	+iamben	either you "lost" some abi_x86_32 entries, or they are too version-specific
2016-02-09 00:57:20	+iamben	basically it's saying "if this were to be rebuilt or upgraded, it would not meet the USE deps of other pkgs"

2016-02-09 00:58:02	+iamben	you still have USE=multilib on nvidia-drivers which needs 32bit stuffs
2016-02-09 00:58:18	gentwo1	do i have to have this in nvidia drivers?
2016-02-09 00:58:33	+iamben	only if you want to be able to use it for 32bit opengl games
2016-02-09 01:00:16	gentwo1	iamben:  no games in the office, i am using fgrun and i guess its 64bit
2016-02-09 01:00:48	+Chainsaw	gentwo1: ...or is it?

2016-02-09 01:10:59	+iamben	if you do not build from source then you lose a lot of the advantages of gentoo

2016-02-09 01:17:00	+iamben	im wanting to get onboard but the only pro so far is "gentoo forked it"
2016-02-09 01:17:19	+xiaomiao	puddlejumper: @system
2016-02-09 01:17:22	ACKNAK	xiaomiao, are you using various evil flags for compiling?
2016-02-09 01:17:31	+xiaomiao	iamben: we get an active upstream that doesn't insult, and catch up to everyone else
2016-02-09 01:17:44	+xiaomiao	ACKNAK: no, but I hide rootkits
2016-02-09 01:17:46	puddlejumper	I need to read more Michio Kaku stuff
2016-02-09 01:18:06	+xiaomiao	iamben: udev standalone is deprecated and strongly discouraged since 2012 - you should have switched years ago
2016-02-09 01:18:24	+iamben	xiaomiao: so it's just a personal conflict, no technical reasons? i believe there are technical reasons, but no one bothers to explain
2016-02-09 01:18:40	+iamben	someone shoudl explain
2016-02-09 01:18:55	puddlejumper	deprecation is technical :p
2016-02-09 01:18:59	+iamben	beyond "upstream are meanie pants"
2016-02-09 01:19:08	+xiaomiao	iamben: no, the technical reason is "udev is unsupported"
2016-02-09 01:19:25	+xiaomiao	like, upstream will not even listen to your stupid whining, go use the proper thing
2016-02-09 01:19:39	+hosler	wow
2016-02-09 01:19:40	+xiaomiao	and everyone who is not using systemd is using the supported version
2016-02-09 01:19:44	+xiaomiao	soo
2016-02-09 01:19:49	+xiaomiao	gentoo is last man standing
2016-02-09 01:19:57	+iamben	so there are no technical advantages to eudev?
2016-02-09 01:20:25	+likewhoa	tomboy64: sup
2016-02-09 01:20:38	+UberPinguin	aren't politics great, iamben ?
2016-02-09 01:21:03	puddlejumper	iamben: it's time to evolve
2016-02-09 01:21:10	+iamben	it is?
2016-02-09 01:21:12	+xiaomiao	iamben: apart from being supported?
2016-02-09 01:21:18	+xiaomiao	I'm confused
2016-02-09 01:21:21	+xiaomiao	as usual
2016-02-09 01:21:33	+xiaomiao	your argument seems to be "it hasn't failed for me, so everything is ok"
2016-02-09 01:21:41	+iamben	xiaomiao: isn't sys-fs/udev still maintained?
2016-02-09 01:21:51	+xiaomiao	iamben: eeeeeeh for small values of 'maintained'
2016-02-09 01:22:04	+xiaomiao	thanks to eudev it still exists on life support
2016-02-09 01:22:20	+iamben	isn't eudev existing "thanks to udev"?
2016-02-09 01:22:59	+xiaomiao	eudev was a response to udev losing features
2016-02-09 01:23:08	+xiaomiao	we're still not back to the state of 2009 :(
2016-02-09 01:23:17	+iamben	maybe you can make a list of outstanding problems/bugs with udev, and mention that as reason to move to euddev
2016-02-09 01:23:31	+xiaomiao	go troll, you're away
2016-02-09 01:23:54	+iamben	im not trolling, you wont give me any real information
2016-02-09 01:24:03	pavlix	xiaomiao: have you heard the news about lennart wanting to replace DNS with D-Bus in applications? :)
2016-02-09 01:24:06	+iamben	some vague implication that upstream sucks and is broken
2016-02-09 01:24:19	+xiaomiao	pavlix: that sounds like his typical lack of understanding
2016-02-09 01:24:31	+xiaomiao	iamben: well, if we ignore all the facts we don't have any facts
2016-02-09 01:24:35	pavlix	xiaomiao: we had a fun time at devconf.cz in Brno
2016-02-09 01:24:58	+xiaomiao	so apart from upstream deprecating standalone udev in 2012 and patches from eudev being reimplemented in it for feature parity ...
2016-02-09 01:25:00	+iamben	xiaomiao: you haven't given any facts, just broad claims that it's totally broken
2016-02-09 01:25:08	+xiaomiao	no, unsupported
2016-02-09 01:25:12	+xiaomiao	stop wording my twists
2016-02-09 01:25:14	+xiaomiao	that's rude
2016-02-09 01:26:01	+iamben	so the idea is that it's easier to be totally forked than to keep packaging udev without upstream's blessing?

2016-02-09 01:26:11	+iamben	im not trying to bicker here
2016-02-09 01:26:17	+xiaomiao	yeah, having a supported fork is easier than trying to coerce upstream
2016-02-09 01:26:36	+xiaomiao	and without eudev we wouldn't have support for older kernels and other nice features
2016-02-09 01:26:41	puddlejumper	systemd
2016-02-09 01:26:43	+iamben	why do we need upstream coerced? it's being packaged successfully as sys-fs/udev afaict
2016-02-09 01:26:56	+xiaomiao	iamben: but any bugfix is going to be like discussing with you
2016-02-09 01:27:04	+xiaomiao	"but I don't have this issue why should we fix it"
2016-02-09 01:27:30	+iamben	are these hypothetical bugs, or ones, that are really fixed in eudev today?
2016-02-09 01:28:06	+iamben	i dont know why you're attacking me personally, i just want some information on eudev
2016-02-09 01:28:19	+xiaomiao	well, support for <=kernel-3 came from eudev
2016-02-09 01:28:28	+xiaomiao	and udev just copied that really fast to remove any feature disparity
2016-02-09 01:28:39	+xiaomiao	thus allowing you to claim eudev is relatively useless :)
2016-02-09 01:28:52	+xiaomiao	well, your communciation style is ... how to say this ...
2016-02-09 01:28:55	+xiaomiao	it's inefficient
2016-02-09 01:28:59	+iamben	no i want eudev to exist, i just dont know what we gain by making it default today

2016-02-09 03:30:03	Tear	i do that in other lines and it's correct
2016-02-09 03:30:05	+hosler	also really not that healhy at all
2016-02-09 03:30:05	+wiktor_b	hosler: is it? I just like the taste and the texture
2016-02-09 03:30:15	+iamben	gentwo1: if you dont want multilib you can disable it in make.conf or package.use
2016-02-09 03:30:20	+hosler	wiktor_b: yes avacado is delicious
2016-02-09 03:30:24	Tear	bash is really strange, the only language i know where quotes inside the same quotes are allowed and even encourated for proper escaping
2016-02-09 03:30:25	+wiktor_b	hosler: I mash it with a fork, sometimes adding spices, sometimes I just add the avocado into other things

2016-02-09 05:16:48	+Cheaterman	Hmm. What do you want to do?
2016-02-09 05:16:57	Tear	convert from flac to ogg, keeping all metadata

2016-02-09 05:17:04	+Cheaterman	Oh
2016-02-09 05:17:06	+Cheaterman	Then just use ffmpeg
2016-02-09 05:17:19	Tear	ffmpeg has moon syntax

2016-02-09 05:17:31	+Cheaterman	otherwise just use ffmpeg
2016-02-09 05:17:36	+Cheaterman	if you're insane, use mencoder

2016-02-09 05:32:21	+Cheaterman	that we even *think* they would waste time visiting us
2016-02-09 05:32:24	puddlejumper	most aliens out there would be at like stage 0 like us and most probably killed themselves before stage 1
2016-02-09 05:32:39	Laurenzo	why on every comparison of any programming language to python mention python is slower than anything :P like they don't know it can be compiled too...
2016-02-09 05:32:42	+Cheaterman	yes puddlejumper
2016-02-09 05:32:45	+Cheaterman	even Sagan said that :)
2016-02-09 05:32:47	gentwo1	all i know is all alien is using gentoo
2016-02-09 05:32:56	+Cheaterman	Laurenzo: you get the point
2016-02-09 05:33:09	+Cheaterman	Laurenzo: they want a REASON to having wasted so much time on <insert any other language here>
2016-02-09 05:33:14	puddlejumper	if we ever make stage 1 we'll see aliens that didn't make stage 1 or maybe one that made stage 1 will see that we didn't make it ;)
2016-02-09 05:33:25	+Cheaterman	I just cried my eyes out, and stopped using C++
2016-02-09 05:33:30	Laurenzo	Cheaterman: lol :) they sound bunch of n00bs :)
2016-02-09 05:33:35	+Cheaterman	Exactly :D
2016-02-09 05:33:37	Laurenzo	C++ .... it's horrible
2016-02-09 05:33:42	+Cheaterman	Yes it is
2016-02-09 05:33:43	Laurenzo	no structure to speak of
2016-02-09 05:33:47	Laurenzo	ad-hoc everywhere
2016-02-09 05:33:54	+Cheaterman	But I've been doing quite a bunch of C too, and it's marginally better only
2016-02-09 05:33:56	+Cheaterman	compared to Python
2016-02-09 05:33:57	puddlejumper	python can do some things just as fast
2016-02-09 05:33:57	Laurenzo	even trivial string operations require 3rd party shit :)

2016-02-09 05:35:22	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: actually ndk is for compiling the python interpreter
2016-02-09 05:35:27	+Cheaterman	at which point you can run normal python
2016-02-09 05:35:29	Laurenzo	Griz64: sorry. Just say the word and I go repent :P
2016-02-09 05:35:30	+Cheaterman	cython is just a bonus :)
2016-02-09 05:35:58	puddlejumper	i mostly do Java these days

2016-02-09 05:36:24	puddlejumper	although I have written a lot of python in the past

2016-02-09 05:36:28	Laurenzo	hosler: I already recite that in my dreams :)
2016-02-09 05:36:29	puddlejumper	a few games
2016-02-09 05:36:30	+Cheaterman	but i wouldn't be too optimistic
2016-02-09 05:36:59	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: java is a sad lang
2016-02-09 05:37:08	+Cheaterman	I wouldn't write it for twice the pay I currently get
2016-02-09 05:37:17	Laurenzo	puddlejumper: Java has been there for a while (though python for even longer)
2016-02-09 05:37:32	+Cheaterman	I wouldn't say longer, both have been here quite a while now
2016-02-09 05:37:58	Laurenzo	I know people (*cough* Cheaterman *cough*) are Java haters, but I do recognize it has it's perks :P
2016-02-09 05:38:07	puddlejumper	there's a lot of stuff i would use python for and a lot i would use java for
2016-02-09 05:38:16	Laurenzo	though then again, I do appreciate brevity and conciseness of python...
2016-02-09 05:39:41	+Cheaterman	Laurenzo: Definitely has perks. you can underpay indians to write the code and still get a working app.
2016-02-09 05:39:44	+Cheaterman	:-)
2016-02-09 05:39:55	+Cheaterman	that's not happening with python yet
2016-02-09 05:40:17	+Cheaterman	other than that, well, it's fast, which once again prevents you from having to find decent devs
2016-02-09 05:40:51	Laurenzo	lol :)
2016-02-09 05:40:55	Laurenzo	well...
2016-02-09 05:41:07	+Cheaterman	I mean I can find more
2016-02-09 05:41:10	+Cheaterman	But the reality is business
2016-02-09 05:41:16	+Cheaterman	and has been described by my two sentences above :p
2016-02-09 05:42:14	SpaceToast	Java has no perks. You're probably thinking of the JVM
2016-02-09 05:42:25	+Cheaterman	↑↑↑↑↑
2016-02-09 05:42:26	Laurenzo	Cheaterman: I recognize some aspects that aren't that nice regarding Java language :P Funny thing is, there are quite a bit commercial software written with it
2016-02-09 05:42:29	Laurenzo	haha
2016-02-09 05:42:36	Laurenzo	JVM is great invention, yes
2016-02-09 05:42:38	+Cheaterman	The language itself is cr*p, the interpreter is very fast tho
2016-02-09 05:42:43	SpaceToast	^
2016-02-09 05:42:46	+Cheaterman	not necessarily means it's well coded but it get sthe stuff done

2016-02-09 05:43:16	+Cheaterman	anywayz Laurenzo last but not least, much easier to write closed source softwawre with java than python

2016-02-09 05:43:47	+Cheaterman	well
2016-02-09 05:43:51	+Cheaterman	i've been doing a bit of Jython
2016-02-09 05:43:54	+Cheaterman	it's impressively good

2016-02-09 05:44:10	+Cheaterman	I prefer what we do with pyjnius though
2016-02-09 05:44:16	+Cheaterman	in terms of "how to expose java"
2016-02-09 05:44:19	Laurenzo	and their open-source counterparts mostly suxz0r
2016-02-09 05:44:32	Laurenzo	jython, that's sick :)
2016-02-09 05:44:45	+Cheaterman	yes it is
2016-02-09 05:44:48	+Cheaterman	it's very slow to start too
2016-02-09 05:44:59	+Cheaterman	but once it's started, well, can't tell the difference from cpython
2016-02-09 05:45:13	+Cheaterman	oh, and once you get it to work with the modules that you like, too. but usually that should be fine
2016-02-09 05:45:19	+Cheaterman	and I know a coredev who helped me with that :)
2016-02-09 05:45:41	+Cheaterman	and then, yeah, you can use java from python totally transparently
2016-02-09 05:46:09	Laurenzo	Cheaterman: I must say the reasons I even work with Java has mostly do with the fact there are some mature frameworks out there and support for many kind of technology&integration :)

2016-02-09 06:40:09	+Cheaterman	Okay, mine is from 2013 I think
2016-02-09 06:40:14	+Cheaterman	maybe 2014 actually
2016-02-09 06:40:28	+Cheaterman	nah definitely 2013 :)
2016-02-09 06:40:29	Tear	are you sure? i think i have a similar cpu
2016-02-09 06:40:41	redeyedman	i5/GTX 750 looks good
2016-02-09 06:40:43	Tear	and while one core can go to 3.2, when 2 or more are active they're capped at 3.0
2016-02-09 06:41:00	+Cheaterman	or could it be 2014 >__> I'm not even sure, I'm gonna ask the ark
2016-02-09 06:41:26	+Cheaterman	could be 2013 :)
2016-02-09 06:41:37	+Cheaterman	anyways time to link KSP and Python
2016-02-09 06:41:44	+Cheaterman	gonna probably make a Kivy-based launch control

2016-02-09 06:42:37	Tear	hm
2016-02-09 06:42:50	Tear	i messed with limits on mine a bit, and that's as high as it went
2016-02-09 06:42:50	+Cheaterman	I'm not sure how turboboost tech works (or worked in 2013)
2016-02-09 06:43:00	+Cheaterman	but I think SpaceToast explained it to me back then?
2016-02-09 06:43:09	+Cheaterman	maybe she can confirm/infirm
2016-02-09 06:43:31	+Cheaterman	redeyedman: yeah, sounds like a pretty good rig, especially if it's a current i5
2016-02-09 06:43:49	+Cheaterman	redeyedman: 750Ti or Ti Boost if available would be worth it
2016-02-09 06:44:06	redeyedman	$600-700
2016-02-09 06:44:18	+Cheaterman	yeah 750ti seems to exist
2016-02-09 06:44:32	+Cheaterman	oh but you might be talking about a laptop, in which case you don't have the choice
2016-02-09 06:44:40	SpaceToast	Turbo Boost is just thermal throttling

2016-02-09 06:45:37	redeyedman	may be
2016-02-09 06:45:44	SpaceToast	Cheaterman: Turbo Boost upclocks if you're far under TDP, and downclocks if you're too close, trying to reach a balance and always be near-TDP

2016-02-09 07:06:17	+Cheaterman	Oh it's Polish
2016-02-09 07:06:56	Tear	it used to be a commercial game, but the source code was given to a polish team of fans and they've been maintaining it since
2016-02-09 07:07:24	+Cheaterman	awesome
2016-02-09 07:07:35	+Cheaterman	Less planet colonization tho

2016-02-09 07:09:28	+Cheaterman	hence colobot gold
2016-02-09 07:09:59	+Cheaterman	making it work on linux is a fairly basic requirement if you want the foss community to take care of a project, really :)
2016-02-09 07:11:22	AsumFace	why is it, whenever i provide proof for my statement in an argument, it gets disregarded and the argument stops? this is both in real life and on the internet
2016-02-09 07:11:29	Tear	there was actually a few versions of the game, colobot was the most "gamey" one of the bunch, and the only one where you can control the robots manually
2016-02-09 07:12:06	Tear	ceebot was all about the code, but the assets for that one haven't been released to that team
2016-02-09 07:12:53	Tear	i wonder if it's difficult to import when you have the disc, probably not
2016-02-09 07:13:05	Tear	the graphics aged surprisingly well given how ancient this game is

2016-02-09 07:53:17	redeyedman	yup
2016-02-09 07:53:19	jaake	I thought 1333 was slow...

2016-02-09 07:53:33	SpaceToast	my CPU is bottlenecking, being an FX 6300

2016-02-09 07:55:17	SpaceToast	jaake: under x70 isn't really worth
2016-02-09 07:55:23	SpaceToast	I used to have a 270 and it was ok
2016-02-09 07:56:07	redeyedman	1333 should be best

2016-02-09 07:56:18	jaake	so my 360 counts as under *70?
2016-02-09 07:56:58	jaake	redeyedman: I think 1600 is pretty standard for high end gaming iirc.
2016-02-09 07:57:03	jaake	these days
2016-02-09 07:57:12	+Cheaterman	hahaha this game is so much more awesome with Python
2016-02-09 07:58:02	SpaceToast	jaake: 270 = *70 (2 being the *), 360 = *60, which is under *70, of course
2016-02-09 07:58:14	+Cheaterman	I can kill people with software bugs
2016-02-09 07:58:24	SpaceToast	the frequency of your ram doesn't really matter much, timings and width are kind of a big deal too
2016-02-09 07:58:27	+Cheaterman	owi how awesome is that :D
2016-02-09 07:59:55	jaake	SpaceToast: what is the difference between the <70 and >60?
2016-02-09 07:59:56	dugz	Cheaterman, you must use your powers for good
2016-02-09 08:00:08	jaake	I'm not a hardware person :)
2016-02-09 08:00:18	jaake	that's why I hang out in here with all you people.
2016-02-09 08:01:05	SpaceToast	jaake: grade. This is just AMD's convention. R7 is "low grade", goes up to 50. R9 is "enthusiast" grade, with 60 being the introductory card which isn't much better than the top R7 (aka 50). 70 and onwards is mid-grade, with 80x and above being "high grade"
2016-02-09 08:02:00	+Cheaterman	dugz: and I do
2016-02-09 08:02:00	jaake	SpaceToast: sorry, I think i have a the R9 390
2016-02-09 08:02:09	+xiaomiao	jaake: you might need a new powersupply
2016-02-09 08:02:09	+Cheaterman	I don't kill them intentionally, and yet I didn't even kill anyone :)
2016-02-09 08:02:22	jaake	xiaomiao: Mine is way above spec
2016-02-09 08:02:25	SpaceToast	jaake: if you can't post with a 390 that's probably your PSU
2016-02-09 08:02:29	jaake	unless it's somehow broken?
2016-02-09 08:02:36	jaake	its 950W
2016-02-09 08:02:46	+hosler	jaake: how many rails
2016-02-09 08:02:47	SpaceToast	what's the efficiency rating on it?
2016-02-09 08:02:48	jaake	Silencer MKII 950W
2016-02-09 08:02:49	+xiaomiao	jaake: I've had problems with a '650W' PSU and ~150W load
2016-02-09 08:02:52	jaake	Silver
2016-02-09 08:02:58	+xiaomiao	the marketingwattage is relatively irrelevant
2016-02-09 08:03:02	jaake	I think? whatever that means
2016-02-09 08:03:05	SpaceToast	xiaomiao: it's 80+ silver so it *should* be ok though
2016-02-09 08:03:10	dugz	If R7 is low grade, my card a R7 265 (hd 7850) is ridiculously good for what it is then
2016-02-09 08:03:13	+hosler	jaake: railssss. how many
2016-02-09 08:03:18	+hosler	+12v rails
2016-02-09 08:03:25	+xiaomiao	SpaceToast: depends on how fast it can ramp up
2016-02-09 08:03:40	SpaceToast	dugz: the 265 is pretty much the "sweet spot" for low-end price/power ratio, though it's better with the 270
2016-02-09 08:03:49	SpaceToast	maybe xiaomiao
2016-02-09 08:03:55	+xiaomiao	SpaceToast: changing from a 135W Phenom to a 135W Phenom II caused some crashes because the PSU couldn't ramp down fast enough
2016-02-09 08:03:55	jaake	it has 4, dual 8s and dual 6 +2s
2016-02-09 08:04:02	jaake	something like that
2016-02-09 08:04:03	+hosler	+2?
2016-02-09 08:04:17	jaake	it has the 6 and then the little 2 guy next to it
2016-02-09 08:04:17	+hosler	usually is +12,+5, and +3
2016-02-09 08:04:19	+hosler	3.3*
2016-02-09 08:04:34	jaake	it's like a 3x3 with a 3x4 option
2016-02-09 08:04:44	+hosler	uhhh
2016-02-09 08:04:45	jaake	or I mean 4x4
2016-02-09 08:04:54	+hosler	how many times does it say +12?
2016-02-09 08:05:05	jaake	4 iirc
2016-02-09 08:05:12	+hosler	ok then that aint no problem there
2016-02-09 08:05:30	+hosler	at least if you are spreading the load
2016-02-09 08:05:33	jaake	it's supposed to support to high end cards
2016-02-09 08:05:37	jaake	two&
2016-02-09 08:05:49	+hosler	if you unplug stuff does it eventually post?

2016-02-09 08:07:16	+hosler	cool
2016-02-09 08:07:22	+hosler	what code is it giving you
2016-02-09 08:07:25	dugz	doc235, no post, no beep is a bad CPU, or memory modules unseated
2016-02-09 08:07:29	jaake	it fails on 97

2016-02-09 08:07:52	jaake	nah, 97 is just the code
2016-02-09 08:08:04	+doc235	turned it off to remove a part and it never restarted
2016-02-09 08:08:04	jaake	old card works fine
2016-02-09 08:08:13	dugz	doc235, try snapping the RAM in and out

2016-02-09 08:08:25	+doc235	i did the ram swap :) no joy
2016-02-09 08:08:53	jaake	I think it may be a UEFI bios thing, this MOBO doesn't have a disable secure boot option.
2016-02-09 08:09:09	jaake	and the firmware hasn't been updated since 2011
2016-02-09 08:09:12	dugz	i mean make sure its pressed down good, i my RAM is hard to get in the slots right, or pull all the RAM except for one stick
2016-02-09 08:09:16	jaake	880G Pro3
2016-02-09 08:09:26	jaake	ASROCK
2016-02-09 08:10:22	jaake	hosler: My current plan is to update the MOBO, if it still doesn't work then I'll send the card back and also upgrade the PSU :)
2016-02-09 08:10:23	+doc235	i pulled all ram but 1 stick and then cycled thru the sticcks with no help
2016-02-09 08:10:48	+hosler	jaake: i would unplug stuff one by one to find the culprit
2016-02-09 08:10:48	dugz	jaake, I have a dead 880G. RIP died of dust bunnies. (It probably still works)
2016-02-09 08:11:10	jaake	hosler: find what culprit?
2016-02-09 08:11:19	jaake	if I put the old card in it works fine

2016-02-09 08:12:22	SpaceToast	0 beeps, just dead vram
2016-02-09 08:12:41	SpaceToast	it would suddenly artifact and then crash *everything*
2016-02-09 08:12:44	+hosler	jaake: to see which hardware is the actual problem
2016-02-09 08:12:46	SpaceToast	I had two, and only one of them did that :D
2016-02-09 08:13:02	dugz	that kinda reminds me, I found a 7600GT OC that needs tested. Maybe it works

2016-02-09 10:12:26	+Cheaterman	can you still do hardware-dependent partitioning somehow?
2016-02-09 10:13:20	+lejonet	Cheaterman: lvm has mappings which you can move around iirc, but it was a while since I used LVM really
2016-02-09 10:13:32	+Cheaterman	okay, sounds nice

2016-02-09 10:14:46	Smiley	you can set a ssd as a cache device infront of the blocks.

2016-02-09 11:20:16	cnnx	the ??? are the weird chars on my system
2016-02-09 11:20:23	cnnx	and i did locale-gen for utf8
2016-02-09 11:20:27	cnnx	and eselect locale list
2016-02-09 11:21:52	cnnx	what should I check?

2016-02-09 11:22:28	Smiley	ooo awesome, the menubar fixed itself too XD
2016-02-09 11:22:29	chry	Well, first you can tell us if you know for sure if this issue is openoffice specific or systemwide...
2016-02-09 11:22:35	cnnx	systemwide
2016-02-09 11:22:38	cnnx	it happens in irssi too
2016-02-09 11:22:41	cnnx	or any other terminal
2016-02-09 11:23:06	cnnx	i see the weird chars in peoples quit message
2016-02-09 11:23:54	chry	What does echo $LANG say?

2016-02-09 11:25:53	chry	cnnx, could you try and google up russian cyrilic or something utf and copy/paste it into a terminal window?
2016-02-09 11:26:13	cnnx	chry: why?
2016-02-09 11:26:15	dugz	I'm going to try and run minidlna. i have no idea what ffmpeg USE flags i should set though
2016-02-09 11:27:11	dugz	chry, I can paste cyrillic into an xterm
2016-02-09 11:27:59	cnnx	chry: its weird, it shows them all as ?
2016-02-09 11:28:02	cnnx	then i paste them
2016-02-09 11:28:29	cnnx	when
2016-02-09 11:28:39	dugz	maybe your xterm font doesn't have good unicode coverage
2016-02-09 11:28:48	cnnx	how do I fix that
2016-02-09 11:28:57	dugz	pick some other font
2016-02-09 11:29:13	dugz	try unifont, ugly but its fixed
2016-02-09 11:29:38	cnnx	im using monospace now
2016-02-09 11:29:53	cnnx	i dont have unifont in the list
2016-02-09 11:30:23	dugz	I use the old Apple Monaco.ttf which you can find for free. It has pretty good unicode and looks fairly nice
2016-02-09 11:30:39	cnnx	changing the font does nothing i just ried
2016-02-09 11:31:08	chry	cnnx, did you env-update && source /etc/profile after locale-gen?
2016-02-09 11:31:13	dugz	maybe your system LINGUAS isn't set to utf8
2016-02-09 11:31:37	cnnx	chry: yes
2016-02-09 11:31:49	cnnx	echo $LINGUAS is blank
2016-02-09 11:32:13	cnnx	where do I set that?
2016-02-09 11:32:16	cnnx	.bashrc ?
2016-02-09 11:32:51	dugz	eselect locale list
2016-02-09 11:33:10	cnnx	its set to utf8

2016-02-09 11:33:30	dugz	i'm not entirely sure, not a big expert on localization, i just set everything to utf8

2016-02-09 11:38:48	cnnx	why dont i have this problem on my other gentoo system
2016-02-09 11:38:53	cnnx	i never emerged noto
2016-02-09 11:38:54	SpaceToast	the goal of noto is to support every language in existence -> good idea to test this out
2016-02-09 11:39:03	SpaceToast	noto isn't the only font with russian symbols, but it's useful as a diagnostic
2016-02-09 11:39:22	cnnx	362MB?
2016-02-09 11:39:23	cnnx	wow
2016-02-09 11:39:27	cnnx	13% done
2016-02-09 11:39:31	SpaceToast	EVERY. LANGUAGE. in the world.
2016-02-09 11:39:41	cnnx	i'll be able to select noto in terminal preferences font?
2016-02-09 11:39:43	chry	cnnx, do you have any graphical text editor?
2016-02-09 11:39:45	cnnx	for xterm?
2016-02-09 11:39:49	SpaceToast	sure?
2016-02-09 11:39:52	cnnx	chry: i dont use gedit much
2016-02-09 11:39:56	SpaceToast	doesn't xterm just use fontconfig?
2016-02-09 11:40:01	chry	But you have it?
2016-02-09 11:40:05	cnnx	let me check
2016-02-09 11:40:06	chry	Like right now?
2016-02-09 11:40:11	cnnx	no
2016-02-09 11:40:13	cnnx	i emerge it?
2016-02-09 11:40:25	chry	No...there must be some in xfce...
2016-02-09 11:40:26	SpaceToast	he wants to make sure it's not some weird xterm conf
2016-02-09 11:40:33	cnnx	ok emerging it
2016-02-09 11:40:36	SpaceToast	leafpad in xfce
2016-02-09 11:40:40	chry	^
2016-02-09 11:40:45	SpaceToast	not default on gentoo tho, iirc
2016-02-09 11:40:46	cnnx	this thinkpad is gonna blow up
2016-02-09 11:40:50	cnnx	im running on battery
2016-02-09 11:40:52	cnnx	full load
2016-02-09 11:41:16	SpaceToast	just pull electricity out of thin air like Tesla, you'll be fine
2016-02-09 11:41:19	cnnx	177mb of noto downloaded so far
2016-02-09 11:41:22	cnnx	:)
2016-02-09 11:41:38	cnnx	gedit is pulling 16 packages
2016-02-09 11:41:42	cnnx	ill be back in a few minutes
2016-02-09 11:41:43	SpaceToast	unsurprising
2016-02-09 11:43:23	cnnx	back
2016-02-09 11:43:31	cnnx	ill take a screenshot
2016-02-09 11:52:31	+zlg	I wonder if I should setup a user on my VPS for IRCing
2016-02-09 11:55:29	cnnx	hey
2016-02-09 11:55:39	cnnx	my system froze and i had to backtrack
2016-02-09 11:55:45	cnnx	i had to unmerge noto to get back into x

2016-02-09 12:02:03	dugz	i can even stream video to my android phone now
2016-02-09 12:02:05	FrostFeline	zlg: Quassel is pretty slick
2016-02-09 12:02:17	cnnx	can someone help with a locale problem?
2016-02-09 12:02:22	cnnx	im still struggling
2016-02-09 12:02:34	dugz	i don't know what else to suggest cnnx
2016-02-09 12:02:37	cnnx	ok
2016-02-09 12:03:21	dugz	cnnx, what kind of terminal is it, or is this system-wide?
2016-02-09 12:03:35	cnnx	xterm
2016-02-09 12:04:10	dugz	doesn't xterm use built-in fonts?
2016-02-09 12:04:12	cnnx	exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator
2016-02-09 12:04:19	cnnx	thats what i run
2016-02-09 12:04:21	+zlg	FrostFeline: ?
2016-02-09 12:04:21	cnnx	in the shortcut
2016-02-09 12:04:38	FrostFeline	zlg: It's a graphical IRC bouncer
2016-02-09 12:04:51	+zlg	Not really sure what a bouncer is.
2016-02-09 12:05:04	dugz	quassel is also dependent on mysql server
2016-02-09 12:05:11	FrostFeline	no it's not
2016-02-09 12:05:24	+zlg	I was thinking I'd just ssh into my VPS and reattach to a tmux session
2016-02-09 12:05:27	+zlg	Nice and simple
2016-02-09 12:05:27	dugz	eh? *looks again at it*
2016-02-09 12:05:30	FrostFeline	It has an embedded sqlite database that you can use.
2016-02-09 12:05:56	+zlg	I need to redo my VPS some time though
2016-02-09 12:06:01	cnnx	dugz: i have a clue now, in xterm its ok
2016-02-09 12:06:11	cnnx	but not the terminal program in xfce4
2016-02-09 12:06:16	SpaceToast	I'm using weechat relays~
2016-02-09 12:06:22	+zlg	Unless I can somehow migrate from standard partitions right now to LVM
2016-02-09 12:06:33	dugz	cnnx, hmmm....
2016-02-09 12:06:37	+zlg	SpaceToast: I use weechat, what's a relay for?
2016-02-09 12:06:52	cnnx	wait
2016-02-09 12:06:57	cnnx	it looks ok in this term too now
2016-02-09 12:06:58	cnnx	odd
2016-02-09 12:07:03	FrostFeline	zlg: It's fairly simple.
2016-02-09 12:07:05	cnnx	when i emerge openoffice-bin
2016-02-09 12:07:43	cnnx	 Б, Г, Д, ё, Ж, П, Ф, И, й, Л, Ц, Ш, Щ,
2016-02-09 12:07:43	cnnx	yes!
2016-02-09 12:07:45	cnnx	it works!
2016-02-09 12:07:50	cnnx	i dont know what changed
2016-02-09 12:07:51	FrostFeline	Make new lvm partitions, cp your data over, edit fstab, grub2-mkconfig
2016-02-09 12:08:11	FrostFeline	grub can boot lvm linear and raid1 among others
2016-02-09 12:08:15	cnnx	maybe i never did env-update && source /etc/profile
2016-02-09 12:08:18	cnnx	what does source do?
2016-02-09 12:08:23	cnnx	and env-update
2016-02-09 12:08:38	+zlg	cnnx: source literally runs all the lines in a given rc file
2016-02-09 12:08:42	FrostFeline	If your disk is already full of partitions you'll have to shrink them first
2016-02-09 12:08:48	cnnx	zlg: ok
2016-02-09 12:09:10	+zlg	FrostFeline: the current setup of my VPS is rather dumb. I didn't realize how dumb it was until I noticed space wasn't being used where I thought it was.
2016-02-09 12:09:24	+zlg	So I'll probably just redo it so it's all one partition.
2016-02-09 12:09:38	cnnx	dugz: im glad its fixed, it was so annoying

2016-02-09 12:10:03	+zlg	I can then break up that partition into LVs
2016-02-09 12:10:25	+zlg	After working with LVM on my desktop, I enjoy the fact I can expand an LV any time I need to
2016-02-09 12:10:31	+zlg	Online resizing, even

2016-02-09 12:11:50	+zlg	That should be a bug to *require* both
2016-02-09 12:11:51	dugz	stuff for quassel

2016-02-09 12:12:04	cnnx	dugz: are you exploring gentoo?
2016-02-09 12:12:07	+zlg	*Supporting* both, or *building* both versions is fine
2016-02-09 12:12:18	dugz	cnnx, always ;)
2016-02-09 12:12:22	cnnx	dugz: fun :)
2016-02-09 12:12:34	dugz	app-crypt/qca-2.1.0.3:2::gentoo  USE="openssl qt4 qt5
2016-02-09 12:12:44	+zlg	USE flags are different from requiring something
2016-02-09 12:12:56	redcheckers	zlg: true.
2016-02-09 12:12:58	FrostFeline	dugz: Quassel is punishing you for using gentoo :P
2016-02-09 12:12:59	dugz	I have -qt4 i make.conf
2016-02-09 12:13:16	dugz	I like quassel but I am NOT installing effin qt4
2016-02-09 12:13:16	redcheckers	dugz: i have -gnome -kde mplayer2
2016-02-09 12:13:35	+zlg	dugz: That sounds like quassel may not have qt5 support yet, then
2016-02-09 12:13:53	+zlg	Or you haven't explicitly used the qt5 flag in make.conf
2016-02-09 12:13:59	dugz	zlg, i think thats it, i see it has (-qt5) now
2016-02-09 12:13:59	+zlg	Let me read the ebuild..
2016-02-09 12:14:04	+zlg	ah
2016-02-09 12:14:25	+zlg	Generally if you're picky about that, you need to negate the one you dislike and add the one you do.
2016-02-09 12:14:34	+zlg	I typically do gtk2 -gtk3 for instance.
2016-02-09 12:14:48	redcheckers	zlg: why not -gtk2 ncurses :))
2016-02-09 12:14:54	dugz	i've been wanting an irc bouncer for a while now, maybe I could put ZNC on catdog
2016-02-09 12:14:57	*	SpaceToast does -gtk -gtk2 -gtk3 -gnome -kde qt -qt4 qt5
2016-02-09 12:15:05	+zlg	redcheckers: Haha, I like your interpretation
2016-02-09 12:15:12	+zlg	ncurses is certainly better than gtk3
2016-02-09 12:15:23	dugz	hey now! I run xfce4 here
2016-02-09 12:15:37	redcheckers	dugz: i prefer icewm because of icewm-themes's themes
2016-02-09 12:15:38	+zlg	dugz: Which runs gtk2 apps afaik
2016-02-09 12:15:43	dugz	oic
2016-02-09 12:15:54	cnnx	i have a question, i have this 1u rackserver i want to use as a development box for programming, where should I locate it?
2016-02-09 12:15:55	+zlg	XFCE doesn't have its own GUI toolkit
2016-02-09 12:15:57	cnnx	in my house its loud
2016-02-09 12:15:59	redcheckers	cnnx: siberia
2016-02-09 12:16:03	cnnx	or should i put it in the basement
2016-02-09 12:16:15	redcheckers	cnnx: put it in siberia, free air conditioning, cheap internet, etc
2016-02-09 12:16:21	cnnx	yeah
2016-02-09 12:16:30	cnnx	expensive to ship
2016-02-09 12:16:37	cnnx	russian IP address will be blacklisted 1
2016-02-09 12:16:39	cnnx	!
2016-02-09 12:17:03	redcheckers	cnnx: lol yeah i noticed that a lot of times i reply to people from my mail.qip.ru account and people can't get it, not even in their spam folder
2016-02-09 12:17:18	redcheckers	cnnx: and then they're like why didnt you reply, and i show them my sent mail box. ^_^
2016-02-09 12:17:25	+zlg	That's pretty crappy.
2016-02-09 12:17:26	cnnx	oh
2016-02-09 12:17:30	+zlg	Why blacklist an entire country?
2016-02-09 12:17:50	cnnx	anyways i dont see the point of using a 1u rack server wjen a regular desktop computer will do the same job
2016-02-09 12:17:55	cnnx	but since i have it already
2016-02-09 12:17:57	cnnx	why not
2016-02-09 12:18:03	+zlg	I mean, unless their government has a problem with you or your site, so you blacklist them just to abide their laws.
2016-02-09 12:18:14	redcheckers	zlg: its cheaper than trying to bring someone to justice there?
2016-02-09 12:18:14	FrostFeline	The quassel binary for OSX has an old qt that doesn't render emoji properly
2016-02-09 12:18:16	+zlg	(which really shouldn't fly because it's dependent on the country your server operates in)
2016-02-09 12:18:41	redcheckers	zlg: did i tell you about the time a russian dating website billed me for opening a letter that didnt open?
2016-02-09 12:18:51	+zlg	redcheckers: lolwut
2016-02-09 12:19:09	FrostFeline	OSX at least uses qt 5.3.2 for quassel 0.12.2
2016-02-09 12:19:12	redcheckers	zlg: i found their lawyer here in the us, several of the banks and post office boxes they use in foreign countries etc, and got the phone number for their office in moscow
2016-02-09 12:19:26	redcheckers	zlg: but they didnt have an answering machine or voicemail set up .
2016-02-09 12:19:41	redcheckers	zlg: so i just had to keep calling ^_^^_^_^_^_^;;;^_^
2016-02-09 12:19:55	redcheckers	zlg: anyhow, they credited me back the credits...
2016-02-09 12:20:07	+zlg	Isn't the onus on them to prove you opened something?
2016-02-09 12:20:17	redcheckers	zlg: but its a lot of effort. imagine if it's something more severe than a 2 credit letter
2016-02-09 12:20:17	+zlg	Or that they provided a service you signed up for?
2016-02-09 12:20:41	redcheckers	zlg: well, they didnt bother claiming anything, because it was such a small amount.
2016-02-09 12:20:43	+zlg	I'd have told them to **** themselves. That's not legitimate.
2016-02-09 12:20:51	redcheckers	zlg: i did leave a review of the law office they use though.
2016-02-09 12:20:55	+zlg	haha
2016-02-09 12:20:59	+zlg	Noice
2016-02-09 12:20:59	redcheckers	zlg: do you know ' yelp' or ' martindale hubbel ' ?
2016-02-09 12:21:11	+zlg	I know about yelp, yeah
2016-02-09 12:21:20	redcheckers	zlg: well, its kind of funny.... i think a lot of law offices shy away from publicity that the russian dating sites enjoy
2016-02-09 12:21:38	redcheckers	zlg: maybe the next dating site operator will see my yelp review, and then hire that same law firm.
2016-02-09 12:22:23	+zlg	So you basically encouraged dating sites to use that specific law firm, knowing full well that such firms don't enjoy the kind of crap dating sites do
2016-02-09 12:22:31	+zlg	That's hilarious if so.
2016-02-09 12:22:37	redcheckers	zlg: well. they already have one as a client
2016-02-09 12:22:42	+zlg	True.
2016-02-09 12:22:49	redcheckers	zlg: so its not like i forced them into their trade, like a human trafficker might
2016-02-09 12:23:04	redcheckers	zlg: but, if the referall helps them to dig themselves in deeper... then it could be amusing?
2016-02-09 12:23:14	+zlg	That's pretty funny.
2016-02-09 12:23:15	+zlg	And clever.
2016-02-09 12:23:18	redcheckers	zlg: anyhow, they have a lot of offshoring.
2016-02-09 12:23:29	redcheckers	zlg: and then their moscow office allegedly can't accept mail.
2016-02-09 12:23:41	+zlg	That's a line of BS.
2016-02-09 12:23:45	+zlg	What address can't accept mail?
2016-02-09 12:23:49	redcheckers	zlg: well, it could be true, if the office is fake.
2016-02-09 12:23:53	+zlg	Ah.
2016-02-09 12:23:56	redcheckers	zlg: a fake address cannot accept mail.
2016-02-09 12:24:16	+zlg	So Russia doesn't have laws mandating a legitimate address for a place of business?
2016-02-09 12:24:29	redcheckers	zlg: well, who says they're a russian business. they have a lot of off shoring
2016-02-09 12:24:43	+zlg	Oh, the law firm itself didn't have a legit address?
2016-02-09 12:24:46	+zlg	But operated in the US?
2016-02-09 12:24:49	redcheckers	zlg: but one of my hobby interests is russian shell corporations.  so it was an interesting exercise
2016-02-09 12:24:56	redcheckers	zlg: the law firm was in california usa
2016-02-09 12:25:14	redcheckers	zlg: the main office of the business is in moscow russia.
2016-02-09 12:25:30	redcheckers	they have several other addresses throughout several island countries in the atlantic
2016-02-09 12:25:46	redcheckers	zlg: including some accountants and more attorneys, marketing firms, deposit corporations etc
2016-02-09 12:25:54	+zlg	o_O
2016-02-09 12:26:04	redcheckers	zlg: but back to point... if you wanted to ask ' why ban an entire country's ip addresses'
2016-02-09 12:26:20	redcheckers	zlg: some people might not feel like going through that much effort... and thats without a specific person to hold accountable
2016-02-09 12:26:43	SpaceToast	redcheckers: don't you know? Only a few may be to blame, but everyone is responsible ;)
2016-02-09 12:26:46	+zlg	What would you hold them accountable *for*L
2016-02-09 12:26:59	redcheckers	zlg: the missing 2 credits/ poor coding on the site
2016-02-09 12:27:05	redcheckers	zlg: blame the programmer!!!

2016-02-09 12:27:53	redcheckers	zlg: no, something i converted money into ^_^
2016-02-09 12:28:03	redcheckers	zlg: like if you go to an amusement park, and change money into ride tickets.
2016-02-09 12:28:05	+zlg	If I got burned like that I'd just leave the site and never come back. Leave a poor review on every site that it was relevant to, and actively dissuade people from using it
2016-02-09 12:28:10	+zlg	redcheckers: ah
2016-02-09 12:28:19	+zlg	Still, you paid for something and didn't get all of it.
2016-02-09 12:28:36	redcheckers	zlg: well, like i said, they credited it back

2016-02-09 12:35:29	+zlg	All these couples out on V-day and the buzz around it, I imagine it's annoying to single people.

2016-02-09 12:36:17	+zlg	I guess what I'm saying is I don't need a holiday to justify getting something for my SO. It's just something I do regularly.

2016-02-09 12:54:53	+zlg	You say 'subspace' though and I'm immediately reminded of a game I played for a while called continuum.

2016-02-09 12:55:02	+zlg	I played on the Trench Wars server.
2016-02-09 12:55:30	redcheckers	zlg: no, continuum was what they did after subspace lost its devs. re-using the same engine and sites but with lots of reverse engineering and reproduction?
2016-02-09 12:55:30	+zlg	lol, such odd questions.
2016-02-09 12:55:42	redcheckers	zlg: trench wars was fun, especially the hockey.

2016-02-09 12:55:54	+zlg	Neat.
2016-02-09 12:55:59	+zlg	And it started as a tank game..

2016-02-09 12:56:12	redcheckers	zlg: no, reread the above. sony took the engine and made a game

2016-02-09 12:57:28	redcheckers	its only when you're at 1200 or above

2016-02-09 13:00:18	+zlg	But a friend taught me how to play wb for a while
2016-02-09 13:00:35	redcheckers	zlg: lancasters are so easy to kill with terriers. you fire first then fly into them and they waste their nrg to shoot you, and then your bullets catch up
2016-02-09 13:00:38	redcheckers	and they die
2016-02-09 13:01:00	+zlg	yeah, terriers are tough to defeat in general due to wonky shot physics.
2016-02-09 13:01:06	redcheckers	zlg: quick go download continuum, and install it in win e.
2016-02-09 13:01:07	+zlg	And if they have turrets, you're probably dead

2016-02-09 13:01:47	+zlg	Well yeah, it's just not like other ships. They're slower and affected by momentum much more than the others.
2016-02-09 13:01:51	redcheckers	mom = distance times mass times velocity?
2016-02-09 13:01:59	redcheckers	zlg: not really.

2016-02-09 13:02:19	+zlg	Maybe the speed of the terrier has a lot to do with it.
2016-02-09 13:02:22	+zlg	They're so dang fast
2016-02-09 13:02:23	redcheckers	zlg: i think the most fun to play though is the shark.... you can set the mines places, and toss slow bullets
2016-02-09 13:02:36	redcheckers	zlg: yeah, but they're not aggresive. fast doesnt matter if they cant kill you
2016-02-09 13:02:38	+zlg	Sharks are tough to play as, but so rewarding.
2016-02-09 13:02:46	redcheckers	no they're not tough to play at all.
2016-02-09 13:02:52	redcheckers	the important thing to remember is ?buy repel
2016-02-09 13:02:58	+zlg	There's a lot of micromanagement.
2016-02-09 13:03:02	redcheckers	no, there's not.
2016-02-09 13:03:07	+zlg	Cloak, antiradar, etc
2016-02-09 13:03:11	redcheckers	you just set a new mine each time someone dies to one...
2016-02-09 13:03:11	cnnx	what was that site again
2016-02-09 13:03:13	+zlg	Lay bombs, shoot missiles
2016-02-09 13:03:14	cnnx	low end what
2016-02-09 13:03:15	redcheckers	zlg: sharks can't cloak.
2016-02-09 13:03:19	cnnx	for the domains
2016-02-09 13:03:20	redcheckers	zlg: you're thinking weasels.
2016-02-09 13:03:32	redcheckers	sharks get radar at high pv. but they set mines and can repel
2016-02-09 13:03:45	+zlg	Sharks are the ones that don't have standard shots, right?
2016-02-09 13:03:55	+zlg	standard size and count on mines and stuff
2016-02-09 13:03:56	redcheckers	zlg: they can throw balls just like javs though
2016-02-09 13:03:59	+zlg	yeah
2016-02-09 13:04:10	+zlg	Those aren't as tough as weasels, yeah.
2016-02-09 13:04:16	+zlg	Still gotta be careful with repels
2016-02-09 13:04:17	redcheckers	they have more hp.
2016-02-09 13:04:25	redcheckers	nah, you can even kill someone with repels
2016-02-09 13:04:38	redcheckers	zlg: figure out what your name was there ^_^_^_^_^_^;;;; ^_^;;
2016-02-09 13:04:38	+zlg	Right, but you still gotta be careful.
2016-02-09 13:04:40	+zlg	Don't waste'em.
2016-02-09 13:04:44	redcheckers	no. you can waste em
2016-02-09 13:04:49	redcheckers	you just have to ?buy repel afterwards
2016-02-09 13:04:54	+zlg	If you have high enough bounty, sure :p
2016-02-09 13:04:58	redcheckers	the points you get for killing with mines are more than you spend on ?buy repel
2016-02-09 13:05:04	redcheckers	its not the bounty. its the points
2016-02-09 13:05:11	+zlg	Don't you have to be in a safe zone to buy?
2016-02-09 13:05:27	+zlg	If you're in the flag room, you can't buy
2016-02-09 13:05:29	+zlg	afaik
2016-02-09 13:05:50	+zlg	Man, so many memories of that game...
2016-02-09 13:06:03	redcheckers	zlg: why would anyone sit in the flag room, its a death trap
2016-02-09 13:06:11	+zlg	redcheckers: defending it!
2016-02-09 13:06:19	redcheckers	better to defend the entrance :P
2016-02-09 13:06:29	+zlg	Entrance is crap. Mid's probably the best place to dogfight
2016-02-09 13:06:42	+zlg	Lots of cover and tactical shots for your javs.

2016-02-09 13:07:38	+zlg	I used to be a levi, turret onto a terrier once I had enough bounty, and just hammer the top side of the flag room with a missile/bomb. It'd catch a lot of people off guard.
2016-02-09 13:07:47	+zlg	Easily get 200+ bounty from that, haha

2016-02-09 13:08:33	+zlg	There were a few places where a good terrier could get you momentum, you'd fire into a specific spot, and it'd slam one side of the flag room pretty well.
2016-02-09 13:08:52	+zlg	I think they nerfed levis after a while
2016-02-09 13:09:08	+zlg	Which is funny because they were the last ship that needed a nerf.

2016-02-14 22:02:15	+_anomaly_	i know of a very commercially successful app written in vb that generates and outputs php to run serverside because the author didn't know how to write asp
2016-02-14 22:02:24	+_anomaly_	it makes me cringe
2016-02-14 22:03:33	+_anomaly_	this is the same guy who asked me what the difference was between 'byref' and 'byval' in vb

2016-02-14 22:05:08	+dugz	PHP was better than ASP, which is about all I can say for it.

2016-02-14 23:39:38	+dugz	Cheaterman, well some things have mysql or postgresql USE flags
2016-02-14 23:40:11	+Cheaterman	these things will need to be configured to use your LAN SQL server instead
2016-02-14 23:40:12	+Cheaterman	no big deal?
2016-02-14 23:40:52	+dugz	well hopefully. is that how the big dogs do it then?
2016-02-14 23:41:05	tomboy64	eh?
2016-02-14 23:41:10	+Cheaterman	dunno if you could call me a big dog but that's how I'd do it, yes.
2016-02-14 23:41:53	tomboy64	dugz: you are aware that the use-flags usually refer to compile-time and run-time dependencies - NOT userspace-config issues, right?
2016-02-14 23:42:33	tomboy64	so whatever you want to use a specific sql server you have to configure yourself. that doesn't mean it does not need the relevant sql useflag set.
2016-02-14 23:42:58	+dugz	i have a little server, not particularly fast, but i'm trying to leverage it. yes tomboy64 although the use flags can trigger setup scripts that expect certain things
2016-02-14 23:43:51	tomboy64	"can" but shouldn't. the use-case you're probably imagining would be something like sqlite; a library providing sql-like access from within the code.
2016-02-14 23:44:49	tomboy64	something is supposed to work with a full-fledged sql-server, it will do this with a server sitting anywhere (provided it's reachable somehow)
2016-02-14 23:45:12	+dugz	cool, this is a bit of an experiement for me. yeah thats what i would expect tomboy64
2016-02-14 23:46:07	+Cheaterman	nothing surprising here dugz, Gentoo is pretty logic in general
2016-02-14 23:46:14	+Cheaterman	which is the reason most of us use it, really.
2016-02-14 23:46:50	+Cheaterman	the only thing that really sucks
2016-02-14 23:47:05	+dugz	i used to use ODBC to access my tables at work, but never set up a centralized sql server on gentoo before
2016-02-14 23:47:32	+Cheaterman	emerge --configure timezone_data
2016-02-14 23:47:48	+Cheaterman	should be changed to something more gentooic like eselect timezone
2016-02-14 23:47:50	+Cheaterman	or something
2016-02-14 23:48:13	+dugz	↑
2016-02-14 23:48:32	+Cheaterman	!karma configure
2016-02-14 23:48:33	+willikins	Cheaterman: karma for configure: -155
2016-02-14 23:49:14	+Cheaterman	emerge --config has a dpkg-reconfigure feeling and i don't like that
2016-02-14 23:52:15	+Cheaterman	eselect timezone set Europe/Paris
2016-02-14 23:52:16	+Cheaterman	:)
2016-02-14 23:52:58	+Cheaterman	should I write a GEP? hahaha

2016-02-15 00:02:08	+iamben	it needs to happen with each timezone-data upgrade, and the manual way is super easy anyway
2016-02-15 00:02:28	+iamben	you could write an eselect module trivially but i dunno if it's worth the effort

2016-02-15 00:17:49	+Cheaterman	zlg: yep, Gentoo (Linux) Enhancement Proposal iirc
2016-02-15 00:18:34	+dugz	Cheaterman, you know, maybe you want the system to maintain concurrent clocks but also have a system wide timezone; e.g. slotted timezones!
2016-02-15 00:19:51	+dugz	one program might run one one timezone, second program might run on another. its highly logical
2016-02-15 00:20:01	+Cheaterman	dugz: don't know how that would work, but okay
2016-02-15 00:21:19	+iamben	programs don't run on any timezones usually, they use UTC
2016-02-15 00:21:34	+iamben	just the stupid humans want to see a local time

2016-02-15 22:38:49	+wiktor_b	cold but sunny
2016-02-15 22:38:50	+monk	HAI!
2016-02-15 22:39:07	+wiktor_b	eroen: got gcc-6 build against musl with no patches!
2016-02-15 22:39:23	+wiktor_b	eroen: once gcc-6 hits stable, musl is a first-class-citizen libc
2016-02-15 22:39:48	+wiktor_b	eroen: currently 4C and sunny, almost no clouds

2016-02-15 22:41:03	+monk	wiktor_b, all good man, you?
2016-02-15 22:41:06	+monk	hey eroen
2016-02-15 22:41:14	+FrostFeline	musl has less interfaces than glibc.
2016-02-15 22:41:23	+wiktor_b	gcc-6.0.0_alpha20160110::toolchain precisely
2016-02-15 22:41:29	+eroen	FrostFeline: this is true
2016-02-15 22:41:31	+FrostFeline	Wouldn't it naturally be easy to support in gcc? or what's the situation?
2016-02-15 22:41:56	+eroen	hello world linked to glibc is also like 100 kb
2016-02-15 22:42:01	+FrostFeline	I tried a hardened-musl install once, and it broke because one of my applications needed glibc.
2016-02-15 22:42:01	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: they really just needed to tell gcc to recognise it

2016-02-15 22:42:48	+FrostFeline	Not sure if it was a hard dep on glibc because musl is newer or if it actually used glibc's extra stuff.
2016-02-15 22:42:54	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: which application? for the over-nine-thousandth time, I'm willing to work on any package anyone needs, provided it's open sauce
2016-02-15 22:43:06	+wiktor_b	:)
2016-02-15 22:43:10	+wiktor_b	I just need to know
2016-02-15 22:43:45	+FrostFeline	¿What if it's habañero sauce?

2016-02-15 22:44:42	+FrostFeline	I don't remember what it was.
2016-02-15 22:44:48	+eroen	wiktor_b: we have 1° and dry for a few days now :)

2016-02-15 22:45:13	+Smiley	I also have no face.
2016-02-15 22:45:24	+eroen	I have 1.4 TCpS now
2016-02-15 22:46:22	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: huzzah! https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/
2016-02-15 22:46:43	+FrostFeline	Now I won't have to do some gymnastics to share disks with windows. I can just LVM everything.
2016-02-15 22:46:45	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: but... why? :D
2016-02-15 22:46:54	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: does it work with lvm, tho?
2016-02-15 22:47:04	+FrostFeline	Well it says "LVM support"
2016-02-15 22:47:06	+wiktor_b	oh, it does, but RO
2016-02-15 22:47:08	+eroen	FrostFeline: I tried to use paragon's live cd thing to do something (I forget what) to an ext4 partition once. I would not recommnend that.
2016-02-15 22:47:16	+Cheaterman	owiiii hello blibli ^__^
2016-02-15 22:47:17	+FrostFeline	That could mean "LVM linear only"
2016-02-15 22:47:21	+eroen	blibli Cheaterman
2016-02-15 22:47:51	+Cheaterman	owiii eroen bliblibli :D you doing goodie?
2016-02-15 22:47:55	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: "Read/Write support for LVM (Logical Volume Management)" Pro edition.
2016-02-15 22:48:11	+eroen	Cheaterman: I goodie, should get some eatsies tho
2016-02-15 22:48:12	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: I was about to say.... how do you implement read support for LVM but no write support to lvm volumes
2016-02-15 22:48:22	+Cheaterman	Owi
2016-02-15 22:48:26	+eroen	Cheaterman go skiing yet?
2016-02-15 22:48:29	+Cheaterman	Me should get some smokiez ^__^
2016-02-15 22:48:35	+Cheaterman	Wat, no hahaha
2016-02-15 22:48:38	+Cheaterman	me at workiiiie
2016-02-15 22:48:50	+eroen	not office skiing day soon?
2016-02-15 22:49:28	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: well, reading is often easier to achieve than writing
2016-02-15 22:49:39	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: especially if the format is not open
2016-02-15 22:49:43	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: but lvm isn't
2016-02-15 22:50:23	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Well the point I was making is that if you go to the effort of implementing a vfs layer to translate the blocks of lvm to physical blocks on the disk it seems you've done all the work (provided the nested filesystem is read/write)
2016-02-15 22:50:47	+FrostFeline	Since LVM doesn't care about filesystems.
2016-02-15 22:50:47	+Cheaterman	eroen: hahahaha we don't do this
2016-02-15 22:51:28	+Cheaterman	Most of them can't ski :-)
2016-02-15 22:51:37	+FrostFeline	It seems there's also Windows dynamic disc support in Linux.
2016-02-15 22:52:39	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: they want to sell you the pro version somehow :)
2016-02-15 22:52:54	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: It's ai'aight
2016-02-15 22:53:52	+FrostFeline	The easiest way to sell it might be to only support Windows Vista/7 in the free edition :P
2016-02-15 22:53:54	*	monk is trying to get entropy to sync through squid
2016-02-15 22:54:02	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: I wouldn't be surprised if ntfs-3g was better than paragon's ext-for-windows
2016-02-15 22:54:18	+eroen	Cheaterman: of course they can't ski if they never can go skiing, that's the point of office ski day!
2016-02-15 22:54:45	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: of course ntft-3g and paragon ext are completely different products.
2016-02-15 22:54:48	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: funny, in scotland "smokies" means something completely different
2016-02-15 22:54:56	+FrostFeline	A better comparison might be paragon ntfs for linux
2016-02-15 22:55:11	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: I mean at the general "let linux and windows be able to rw the same fs"
2016-02-15 22:55:18	+FrostFeline	Well, "ntfs&hfs"
2016-02-15 22:55:35	*	eroen likes ufs more better
2016-02-15 22:55:41	+FrostFeline	there's an "express" version
2016-02-15 22:55:45	+eroen	err.
2016-02-15 22:55:47	+eroen	udf I mean
2016-02-15 22:55:47	+FrostFeline	Never tried it.
2016-02-15 22:55:58	+FrostFeline	Linux supports UDF rw?
2016-02-15 22:56:02	+eroen	yes
2016-02-15 22:56:10	+eroen	windows also, since vista
2016-02-15 22:56:40	+FrostFeline	Why invent ext4 then?
2016-02-15 22:57:23	+eroen	features and performance? :P
2016-02-15 22:57:23	+wiktor_b	isn't udf a ro fs anyway?
2016-02-15 22:57:36	+wiktor_b	ach, packet writing
2016-02-15 22:57:41	+eroen	:D
2016-02-15 22:57:51	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: udf really doesn't work for anything apart from spinning plastic
2016-02-15 22:58:03	+eroen	I use on usb sticks

2016-02-15 23:00:46	+FrostFeline	The one on the left is one that's been sitting around for 10 years so I figured why not.
2016-02-15 23:01:25	+FrostFeline	So in a week I'll have duel 1080p monitors. I got one of the kind I already had so it wouldn't look weird.

2016-02-15 23:03:23	+FrostFeline	Well I guess the patent issue could be a problem for those that care.
2016-02-15 23:03:50	+FrostFeline	There's not much evil microsoft can do with a filesystem though
2016-02-15 23:04:03	+FrostFeline	Everyone's going to just keep using the lowest common denominator -- FAT
2016-02-15 23:04:07	+wiktor_b	why take part in the ecosystem, though?
2016-02-15 23:04:34	+FrostFeline	I already use windows for games.
2016-02-15 23:04:35	+wiktor_b	it's not quite exactly but still quite close to buying broadcom or nvidia chips
2016-02-15 23:04:38	+FrostFeline	That's pretty evil.
2016-02-15 23:04:50	+FrostFeline	That means I paid microsoft real money to use the OS.
2016-02-15 23:05:01	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: meh, if you use it as a more customisable games console, it's not that evil
2016-02-15 23:05:18	+Tear	go all foss, have an ext4 pendrive
2016-02-15 23:05:19	+FrostFeline	I'd never let my data get locked up in some proprietary database anyway.

2016-02-15 23:27:20	+FrostFeline	So your machine gets woken up when something tries to access the disk.

2016-02-15 23:30:24	+eroen	sounds good
2016-02-15 23:30:28	ntwari	eroen: what determines their elderliness?
2016-02-15 23:31:44	+eroen	ntwari: IMO you are not elderly if you can still stand upright and walk stairways at normal speed

2016-02-15 23:32:55	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Right, but that something can be anything.
2016-02-15 23:33:08	+eroen	Smiley: you looked at the official tutorial, right?
2016-02-15 23:33:11	+eroen	https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/argparse.html
2016-02-15 23:33:18	+Smiley	yeah reading it atm
2016-02-15 23:33:21	+Smiley	but it's not exactly great :/
2016-02-15 23:33:23	+FrostFeline	A desktop, a laptop, a router, or an apple tv
2016-02-15 23:33:38	+FrostFeline	routers and apple tvs are always going to be awake anyway.
2016-02-15 23:33:41	+Smiley	I guess I need to use store_true
2016-02-15 23:33:48	+Smiley	but  Idon't know how I later access that to check it
2016-02-15 23:33:51	+eroen	Smiley: for a --quiet flag you probably want action=store_true
2016-02-15 23:34:02	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: why not make that something be the nas?
2016-02-15 23:34:15	+FrostFeline	The NAS uses a lot more power than a router.

2016-02-15 23:34:38	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: spin down the HDDs whenever you can, also don't stick x86 in your nas :)
2016-02-15 23:34:46	+FrostFeline	Well, maybe.
2016-02-15 23:35:05	+FrostFeline	Not sure, haven't done the testing myself.

2016-02-15 23:35:16	+FrostFeline	But the power to your network equipment is basically free.
2016-02-15 23:35:20	+Smiley	eroen: so it knows to strip the -- off for the variable name?
2016-02-15 23:35:24	+eroen	yes

2016-02-15 23:35:26	+Smiley	:D
2016-02-15 23:35:27	+eroen	magic :P
2016-02-15 23:35:41	+FrostFeline	Since in order for your NAS (or the rest of your business to work) you need to keep it powered before anything else will.
2016-02-15 23:35:57	+Smiley	So I'd do if args.quiet: foo.
2016-02-15 23:36:01	+eroen	yes
2016-02-15 23:36:08	+FrostFeline	No reason to have your sleep proxy be the NAS when your router does the job better. (in general)
2016-02-15 23:36:14	ntwari	eroen: so what do you call someone in their late 50s/early 60s?
2016-02-15 23:36:41	+FrostFeline	Then you can power the whole system down minus the ram sticks.
2016-02-15 23:36:51	+FrostFeline	I guess you could go for SSDs to save a few bucks on power.
2016-02-15 23:38:20	+eroen	ntwari: baby boomers?
2016-02-15 23:38:37	+eroen	or, in the case of doc235, stoners

2016-02-16 00:48:37	+jrunyon	       -n     do not output the trailing newline
2016-02-16 00:48:39	+Smiley	Why? :D
2016-02-16 00:48:48	+jrunyon	    Display the ARGs on the standard output followed by a newline.
2016-02-16 00:48:48	+jrunyon	    Options:
2016-02-16 00:48:48	+jrunyon	      -n        do not append a newline
2016-02-16 00:48:55	+jrunyon	because echo is very basic?
2016-02-16 00:48:57	+Smiley	Yus
2016-02-16 00:49:04	+Smiley	So, knowing stuff isn't basic.
2016-02-16 00:49:12	+jrunyon	and because you should RTFM like a good little emoticon?
2016-02-16 00:49:16	+jrunyon	;)
2016-02-16 00:49:18	+Smiley	I've given you no reason to believe I've worked with echo before :D
2016-02-16 00:49:23	+jrunyon	...

2016-02-16 00:49:28	+jrunyon	you're in #gentoo-*
2016-02-16 00:49:29	+Smiley	this is breaking ground.
2016-02-16 00:49:32	+jrunyon	so
2016-02-16 00:49:39	+jrunyon	you sure better have worked with echo
2016-02-16 00:49:43	+Smiley	hmmmm
2016-02-16 00:49:50	+Smiley	back in the day using it with mirror select
2016-02-16 00:49:53	+Smiley	not much else :D
2016-02-16 00:49:54	+jrunyon	that's pretty much a prerequisite to installing gentoo imo :D
2016-02-16 00:50:07	+jrunyon	basic unix shell knowledge
2016-02-16 00:50:32	+Smiley	pffft.
2016-02-16 00:50:36	+Smiley	Gentoo teaches this :)
2016-02-16 00:50:44	+Smiley	but as I said, not a programmer.. lol
2016-02-16 00:50:51	+Smiley	I rarely echo stuff, scripts should stfu. :D

2016-02-16 01:14:42	+iamben	gentwo: you seem to have an incomplete unmask of qt5, autounmask often fails on this.  replace your qt5 related entries in package.accept_keywords with a single entry "dev-qt/*:5"
2016-02-16 01:16:54	+kensington	that situation should be improving fortunately
2016-02-16 01:17:39	+iamben	kensington: 5.5.1 stable coming soon?
2016-02-16 01:17:45	+kensington	yep
2016-02-16 01:17:51	+iamben	good deal
2016-02-16 01:18:04	+kensington	also future version bumps of kde stuff will have every qt atom with the version specified to help autounmask
2016-02-16 01:18:31	+iamben	i know the dev-qt/* entry isn't a perfect solution since it'll allow more unstable than needed later, but it's a quick workaround

2016-02-16 01:20:04	+iamben	yeah it's pretty limited in what's allowed

2016-02-16 03:47:24	catpig	or IRC client for that matter
2016-02-16 03:47:34	+eroen	I used facebook in bitlbee a bit
2016-02-16 03:47:53	+eroen	Then I remembered why I stopped using facebook in the first place
2016-02-16 03:47:57	catpig	hehe
2016-02-16 03:48:10	catpig	well i was just wondering if anyone else was having a bug i see
2016-02-16 03:48:22	+eroen	oic
2016-02-16 03:48:30	catpig	dont really wanna hassle the pidgin people because, well, you remembered why you stopped using facebook ;)
2016-02-16 03:48:38	+FrostFeline	bleh
2016-02-16 03:48:40	+eroen	I only see babies and selfies, no bugs
2016-02-16 03:49:13	+Chainsaw	catpig: There's a Pidgin plugin.
2016-02-16 03:49:19	+Chainsaw	catpig: It's called purple-facebook and it's in portage.
2016-02-16 03:49:28	+FrostFeline	I'll wait till I finish Mass Effect 1+2 before I try arch, everything about doing a dual boot with an existing wwindows install is painful :(
2016-02-16 03:49:45	catpig	Chainsaw, yeah, thats what im using. but everytime it reconnects i re-receive a set of seemingly arbitrarily selected messages of the last few months (!)
2016-02-16 03:49:47	*	eroen ran out of croissants and goes back bo bike fixings
2016-02-16 03:49:57	+Chainsaw	catpig: Works fine here...
2016-02-16 03:50:02	+FrostFeline	It won't let me shrink the windows drive much while the system is booted.
2016-02-16 03:50:03	catpig	ok, cheers
2016-02-16 03:50:12	+FrostFeline	"Unmovable file" my buttocks
2016-02-16 03:50:34	catpig	FrostFeline, boot sysresccd; startx; gparted
2016-02-16 03:50:45	catpig	will require shutting down windows ofc ;)
2016-02-16 03:51:15	+hosler	eroen: supe doodmeister
2016-02-16 03:51:17	+FrostFeline	Eh, don't want to risk trashing the windows install just yet.
2016-02-16 03:51:18	catpig	you could try booting sysresccd in a vm and giving it raw access to your windows disk.. probably a bad idea though
2016-02-16 03:51:44	+FrostFeline	I've had gparted spin for hours on a partition shrink before.
2016-02-16 03:51:52	+hosler	Griz64: are you in love with plex yet
2016-02-16 03:51:54	catpig	partition resizing is one of the few ways i have not yet managed to blow up a windows with
2016-02-16 03:52:04	catpig	was the disk damaged?
2016-02-16 03:52:11	+FrostFeline	Maybe it was just an old gparted.
2016-02-16 03:52:27	+FrostFeline	Not that I know of. The machine continued to function for about 6 years until the PSU gave out.
2016-02-16 03:52:38	catpig	hm probably a parted bug then
2016-02-16 03:52:41	+Chainsaw	FrostFeline: It used to love reverting to "just copy it block by block" behaviour. Word has it that got better.
2016-02-16 03:52:42	+Griz64	hosler, well, it took me until an hour ago, to get it to share OUTSIDE my network. :-\
2016-02-16 03:52:53	catpig	ah talking of which, brb
2016-02-16 03:52:54	+hosler	lol
2016-02-16 03:52:56	+iamben	gparted itself doesn't really do any "heavy lifting", it just calls parted & fs resize tools with the right numbers
2016-02-16 03:53:00	+hosler	Griz64: now we can share with eachother
2016-02-16 03:53:04	+FrostFeline	Then the disk still ran like a champ until I replaced it. It only ever had 3.5 years of spinup time.
2016-02-16 03:53:35	+FrostFeline	So out of 10 years, I was using it just over a third of the time it was powered on.
2016-02-16 03:54:00	catpig	FrostFeline, more than an office computer is expected to bear ;)
2016-02-16 03:54:14	+FrostFeline	It isn't an office computer.
2016-02-16 03:54:31	+FrostFeline	It was some fancy OEM gaming system
2016-02-16 03:54:48	+FrostFeline	With a whopping ... 1GB of ram and a Radeon X1300 with integrated TV tuner.
2016-02-16 03:55:13	+FrostFeline	Ran XP media center... ooo
2016-02-16 03:55:20	catpig	yikes
2016-02-16 03:55:43	+FrostFeline	Remember when microsoft had good products? :P
2016-02-16 03:55:48	catpig	hm, not really
2016-02-16 03:56:14	+FrostFeline	Hm
2016-02-16 03:56:29	catpig	win2000 served me well until uninstalling keyboard extra software (for a long gone keyboard) figured "hey, i'll remove the keyboard driver, too" was a good idea
2016-02-16 03:56:44	+FrostFeline	Well media center was like using a roku, except it was on a PC instead of a locked down media brick.
2016-02-16 03:56:48	catpig	and i gather NT4 was quite good
2016-02-16 03:57:07	+FrostFeline	catpig: Windows XP was the upgrade to Windows Vista ;)
2016-02-16 03:57:21	+FrostFeline	They just released them backwards
2016-02-16 03:57:28	catpig	XP was ok. much like 2k but with a more painful theme

2016-02-16 03:58:19	catpig	though XP was useful, because with that people finally started removing the "if are_you_a_winNT then i_wont_start_f***_you" code from games
2016-02-16 03:58:58	+FrostFeline	mass effect just bluescreened my windows install >_>
2016-02-16 03:59:01	catpig	but now XP is gone
2016-02-16 03:59:25	+FrostFeline	Why would they put that code in the game?
2016-02-16 03:59:56	catpig	was standard in win9x days because NT4 lacked 3d hw acceleration for games
2016-02-16 04:00:34	catpig	so if an NT was detected the games would often refuse to install and refuse to run. even if you were in win2k and hat working direct3d

2016-02-16 04:10:29	+FrostFeline	Maybe there's a third party fork of gzip?
2016-02-16 04:10:46	+FrostFeline	I can't see the taring process itself being CPU bound.
2016-02-16 04:10:59	catpig	nah tar would be io-bound
2016-02-16 04:11:06	catpig	though in this case it is gzip-bound
2016-02-16 04:11:21	catpig	and there's a "pigz: a parallel implementation of gzip"

2016-02-16 04:16:48	+FrostFeline	1280x720p is 16:9
2016-02-16 04:17:10	+FrostFeline	So I know all these other 1280x resolutions can't also be 16:9, they're not even close to 720p
2016-02-16 04:17:26	catpig	it could put black strips on the top/bottom
2016-02-16 04:17:46	catpig	like DVDs do. they actually encode the blackness as part of the picture
2016-02-16 04:18:23	+FrostFeline	Yay for video compression.
2016-02-16 04:18:35	+FrostFeline	Otherwise that would take up a huge part of the space on your disc :)
2016-02-16 04:18:45	catpig	yeah but its a problem when idiots rip them
2016-02-16 04:19:28	+FrostFeline	Oh boy, mass effect on "ultra".
2016-02-16 04:19:30	+FrostFeline	Here goes.
2016-02-16 04:19:31	catpig	because in video files its a problem if you wanna play them windowed
2016-02-16 04:20:05	+FrostFeline	Can you use odd aspect ratios in vlc?
2016-02-16 04:20:18	+FrostFeline	Like video stretching as opposed to just scaling
2016-02-16 04:20:43	catpig	i would assume so
2016-02-16 04:20:57	catpig	but i dont like vlc
2016-02-16 04:21:57	catpig	i just realised something great

2016-02-16 04:41:59	+FrostFeline	I wonder if pigz can crash a skylake
2016-02-16 04:42:08	catpig	its probably faster than raw copying on this ssd lol
2016-02-16 04:42:17	catpig	are skylakes crashy?
2016-02-16 04:42:27	+FrostFeline	They crash on the prime95 test

2016-02-16 04:43:29	catpig	Smiley, you skipped the bit that said whats wrong :P
2016-02-16 04:43:32	+FrostFeline	Also there's a bug in iOS where you set your time to jan 1 1970 and it bricks your phone until your unix time is non-negative.
2016-02-16 04:43:45	catpig	nice
2016-02-16 04:43:50	+FrostFeline	The funniest part was
2016-02-16 04:43:56	+FrostFeline	A redditor did it and bricked his phone
2016-02-16 04:44:08	+FrostFeline	The apple genius didn't believe him and bricked his phone too.
2016-02-16 04:44:12	catpig	lol
2016-02-16 04:44:18	+Tear	it doesn't brick
2016-02-16 04:44:22	+FrostFeline	So now they're both RMA
2016-02-16 04:44:24	+Tear	the phone is fine once the battery runs down
2016-02-16 04:44:32	+iamben	we all read the same news stories i think
2016-02-16 04:44:45	+Tear	or if you take it ou- oh right. iphone.
2016-02-16 04:44:50	catpig	i pretty much only read lwn these days
2016-02-16 04:45:02	+FrostFeline	Tear: It's pretty easy with a screwdriver.
2016-02-16 04:45:13	+FrostFeline	You might need a star bit for some of the models of iPhone.
2016-02-16 04:45:17	catpig	Tear, a bug like that would leave me without phone for a week
2016-02-16 04:45:40	+Tear	i heard some people are doing that to display devices in apple stores
2016-02-16 04:45:49	+Smiley	catpig: iknow hehe
2016-02-16 04:45:56	+FrostFeline	You can semi-brick an iPhone by changing the MAC address.
2016-02-16 04:45:57	+Smiley	about to get a link to the script and then share the error.
2016-02-16 04:46:00	catpig	i thought of people doing it to their friends
2016-02-16 04:46:09	+Smiley	you can brick an iphone by setting the date to epoch 0
2016-02-16 04:46:12	catpig	"hey, set your phone to 1970, its an easter egg, shows a funny video"
2016-02-16 04:46:12	+FrostFeline	It's really difficult to change it back.
2016-02-16 04:46:33	+FrostFeline	Tell them to set their phone to one week before Jan 1 1970 :)

2016-02-16 04:46:59	+doc235	i forget why the date 1970 is important
2016-02-16 04:47:04	+doc235	long time ago
2016-02-16 04:47:04	catpig	Tear, yeah like that lol
2016-02-16 04:47:13	catpig	doc235, i think its the start of unix time
2016-02-16 04:47:19	+lejonet	doc235: 1970, 1st jan is beginning of unix time
2016-02-16 04:47:20	catpig	the one that runs out in 2038
2016-02-16 04:47:21	+FrostFeline	doc235: It's the zero time of some time system.
2016-02-16 04:47:35	+doc235	ah yes :)
2016-02-16 04:47:42	+doc235	brain farts. getting old
2016-02-16 04:47:46	catpig	fortunately people are starting to fix the y2038 problem already
2016-02-16 04:47:47	+FrostFeline	catpig: or we could just switch to 64 bit integers! :D
2016-02-16 04:47:58	+FrostFeline	y2k was so much more fun
2016-02-16 04:48:07	catpig	FrostFeline, well thats what theyre doing
2016-02-16 04:48:15	+FrostFeline	The world was going to end.
2016-02-16 04:48:21	+Smiley	errrr why does it seem i have no git repo on this system
2016-02-16 04:48:23	catpig	oh the same will happen in 2037
2016-02-16 04:48:31	+Tear	only 32bit iphones are susceptible
2016-02-16 04:48:33	catpig	because people will forget 1 million pieces of software
2016-02-16 04:48:40	+Smiley	how do i see which repo this things it's connected to
2016-02-16 04:48:45	+FrostFeline	Why not just represent epoch time with 64 bits?
2016-02-16 04:48:50	+FrostFeline	or 128?
2016-02-16 04:48:53	catpig	FrostFeline, thats what they're doing
2016-02-16 04:48:54	+FrostFeline	etc etc
2016-02-16 04:49:09	+doc235	now i don't actua;lly remember why 2038 is a problem.
2016-02-16 04:49:20	catpig	but it's more than just changing one variable definition. a lot more. you have to change the on-disk format of file systems for example
2016-02-16 04:49:33	catpig	doc235, unix time is a 32bit int of seconds since 1970
2016-02-16 04:49:40	+doc235	oh cool
2016-02-16 04:49:44	catpig	and 2038 is 32bit seconds after 1970
2016-02-16 04:49:45	+doc235	did not know that
2016-02-16 04:50:09	+eroen	wait, 32bit timespec still exists?
2016-02-16 04:50:12	catpig	basically, those idiots in the 60s didnt think their software or software using the same APIs and formats would still be in use in 2038
2016-02-16 04:50:28	+doc235	who wqould
2016-02-16 04:50:38	+Smiley	Nintendo.
2016-02-16 04:50:39	+FrostFeline	Will I still be able to play mass effect in 2038? I wonder...
2016-02-16 04:50:43	+Smiley	with their 1000 yr plan.
2016-02-16 04:51:02	+doc235	i remember when the rumor was that they invented a sattellite dish the size of a large pizza :)
2016-02-16 04:51:22	catpig	they make much smaller ones by now dont they?
2016-02-16 04:51:27	catpig	pretty sure i sold smaller ones actually
2016-02-16 04:51:35	+doc235	no idea
2016-02-16 04:51:44	+FrostFeline	Maybe it's an X-ray sattelite transceiver
2016-02-16 04:51:46	+eroen	you can get them any size, from small coin to large building ;)
2016-02-16 04:51:46	+doc235	iremember the talk about the CD coming out

2016-02-16 07:17:49	+doc235	yup
2016-02-16 07:18:02	CcxCZ	If the computer is unusable while compiling, then that's an issue for sure.
2016-02-16 07:18:25	+iamben	if you cannot be away from your computer for 10 hours at least once a week, that's also an issue =)
2016-02-16 07:18:46	CcxCZ	That's assuming everything in the upgrade goes smoothly.
2016-02-16 07:19:38	+iamben	well you cannot successfully compile something without at least trying to compile it =)
2016-02-16 07:20:02	redeyedman	well, may be my pc isn't suitable for gentoo, but I already accustomed to that distro unlike to others like debian or ubuntu

2016-02-16 07:22:10	CcxCZ	I tend to prefer snapshot/chroot/binpkg for unmanned upgrades, so it won't break the system while compiling.
2016-02-16 07:24:31	redeyedman	gentoo doesn't fail after updates so often unlike other binary distros
2016-02-16 07:24:44	redeyedman	for me
2016-02-16 07:25:04	catpig	i used to update unimportant systems first but its so rare that something goes unexpectedly wrong that now i usually dont bother

2016-02-16 07:26:00	CcxCZ	I tend to get compile errors here and there, usually for when my setup deviates from the common ones.
2016-02-16 07:26:07	tomboy65	lol
2016-02-16 07:26:34	tomboy65	i haven't had a breaking compile ruin my system ever since i'm using linux
2016-02-16 07:26:57	redeyedman	right
2016-02-16 07:27:01	catpig	all depends on how you define "ruin"
2016-02-16 07:27:07	tomboy65	i had, however, successful merges render systems unbootable. that was pre-2.1, though (preserved-rebuild anyone?)
2016-02-16 07:27:30	redeyedman	hmm I hadn't
2016-02-16 07:27:32	CcxCZ	now that revdep-rebuild is (mostly) gone it's less common, sure, but it still can blow up spectacularly
2016-02-16 07:28:00	tomboy65	CcxCZ: that's what you have elog for. and successful merges? no.
2016-02-16 07:28:02	CcxCZ	not updating etc in time can also cause fun
2016-02-16 07:28:32	+iamben	CcxCZ: not heeding the advice printed after emerge is done, can be harmful to your health
2016-02-16 07:28:58	tomboy65	oh, and "computer being unsuable while compiling" tells me you failed to configure your -j --load-average options properly. not just PORTAGE_DEFAULT_OPTS, also MAKEOPTS
2016-02-16 07:29:11	catpig	there's also PORTAGE_NICENESS
2016-02-16 07:29:37	+iamben	new items, config changes, various pkg_postinst warnings, etc
2016-02-16 07:29:43	tomboy65	catpig: which pales in effectiveness compared to load-average
2016-02-16 07:30:02	catpig	tomboy65, shrug, my system works almost flawless at load 20
2016-02-16 07:30:19	CcxCZ	tomboy65: I was talking mainly about upgrades breaking down in middle of stuff, which does happen more when you turn of funny USE like "debug" and so on.

2016-02-16 07:31:28	CcxCZ	iamben: Indeed, I was talking about unmanned compiles, so we seem to agree.
2016-02-16 07:32:01	+hosler	CcxCZ: you use debug flag?
2016-02-16 07:32:08	+hosler	doesnt that make your binaries 1000x bigger?
2016-02-16 07:32:37	catpig	hosler, i think you're thinking of not stripping the binaries
2016-02-16 07:32:50	catpig	which, iirc, is a PORTAGE_FEATURES
2016-02-16 07:32:55	CcxCZ	hosler: nope, that's configured in FEATURES, with splitdebug it's placed in separate location so it's fine
2016-02-16 07:34:33	CcxCZ	so far I have counted something around 50 packages that were at some point uncompilable with debug USE

2016-02-16 07:34:55	+iamben	that's why most people dont set USE=debug globally
2016-02-16 07:35:33	tomboy65	lol
2016-02-16 07:35:59	CcxCZ	Indeed. My point was the less tested your configuration is … the less tested it is.
2016-02-16 07:36:31	tomboy65	and i would reckon 49 of those 50 packages are upstream issues
2016-02-16 07:37:32	CcxCZ	Most likely. Lot of developers don't like gentoo for the precise reason it makes it easy to find upstream bugs. :]
2016-02-16 07:37:51	tomboy65	^^
2016-02-16 07:38:35	tomboy65	but a compile failing doesn't break stuff. --keep-going removes the depending packages from the list and resumes the rest
2016-02-16 07:42:07	+iamben	i guess everybody handles production-system-risk differently =)

2016-02-16 09:22:10	slicktux	So, I have a lappy that does not support HDD unlock via its BIOS; I am trying to come up with a method to unlock the HDD via a USB; (I need HDD Password on). . . The lappy has Gentoo installed; I was thinking maybe I can make a simple USB stick that loads GRUB and holds the Kernel and HDPARM and then mount my / after unlocking the HDD with hdparm. . . any ideas? Should I do a simple Gentoo install on
2016-02-16 09:22:16	slicktux	 a USB stick and just mount / when necessary?

2016-02-16 09:24:28	+wiktor_b	but you have to realise anyone can boot the system with a livecd/pendrive then
2016-02-16 09:24:37	+wiktor_b	if you don't want that, you have to encrypt
2016-02-16 09:27:24	slicktux	wiktor_b: well, as long as '/' is in the locked HDD I am fine. . . it is a SED  Self-encrypting-drive. . .

2016-02-16 09:34:37	shadowdao	slicktux: Yeah basically.  I haven't done this, but I think it's possible.
2016-02-16 09:34:49	slicktux	I'll check out the Wiki thankt
2016-02-16 09:37:12	+stintel	I think I would trust LUKS over a "self-encrypting-drive"
2016-02-16 09:38:38	shadowdao	You can also incorporate LVM into the setup.
2016-02-16 09:39:33	+stintel	on my laptop I have a 512MB EFI system partition, rest is luks. have this in kernel options: crypt_root=/dev/sda2
2016-02-16 09:39:45	+stintel	during boot, the passphrase to unlock the drive is asked
2016-02-16 09:44:24	shadowdao	I just use passphrases too.
2016-02-16 09:44:49	shadowdao	It's "good enough".
2016-02-16 09:46:04	shadowdao	I think with LUKs you can use both?
2016-02-16 09:47:48	slicktux	stintel: yes, I have my doubts over  SED's but hey. . .
2016-02-16 09:48:04	slicktux	I'll try out LUKs
2016-02-16 09:48:07	+stintel	shadowdao: yes
2016-02-16 09:48:53	+stintel	one thing I still need to do is create an initrd that spawns dropbear
2016-02-16 09:49:07	+stintel	so I can enter the passphrase via SSH when WOL'ing a remote box with LUKS encrypted filesystem

2016-02-16 10:16:35	shadowdao	I'm kinda in that category too.
2016-02-16 10:16:44	+Tatsh	i don't know how you implied that

2016-02-16 10:16:54	+Tatsh	that would be cool'
2016-02-16 10:17:07	cnnx	can someone help me understand when i type 'free -h' which is the real memory free ??? the "free" column or the "available" column?
2016-02-16 10:17:17	shadowdao	I refuse to use Skype.
2016-02-16 10:17:22	+Tatsh	yea so i'm on irc
2016-02-16 10:17:26	+Tatsh	on quassel technically
2016-02-16 10:17:37	+Tatsh	cnnx, you need to understand how memory use works in modern OS
2016-02-16 10:17:58	cnnx	available ram
2016-02-16 10:18:01	cnnx	used ram
2016-02-16 10:18:02	cnnx	and free ram
2016-02-16 10:18:03	cnnx	simple
2016-02-16 10:18:09	cnnx	why confuse it
2016-02-16 10:18:11	+Tatsh	no
2016-02-16 10:18:23	+Tatsh	almost all ram is consumed, or 'wired' as OS X calls it
2016-02-16 10:18:45	+Tatsh	it's basically a huge amount of cached data, especially a lot of information on the file system
2016-02-16 10:18:54	cookiemon5ter	i think some is cached
2016-02-16 10:19:13	cookiemon5ter	cnnx: it is the reason why a webbrowser opens faster the second time :p
2016-02-16 10:19:30	cnnx	cache
2016-02-16 10:19:35	cookiemon5ter	if it's cached then it won't need to load everything again
2016-02-16 10:19:48	+Tatsh	yea
2016-02-16 10:19:56	shadowdao	Caches are for the Russian GRU.
2016-02-16 10:19:57	+Tatsh	the kernel does this intentionally; it refuses to page such memory
2016-02-16 10:20:04	+Tatsh	that is, if you have a swap file at all
2016-02-16 10:20:26	cookiemon5ter	cnnx: so you have a certain amount being used and a certain amount that is used + what can become available if needed
2016-02-16 10:20:37	+Tatsh	although this is for OS X, this is probably the best explanation
2016-02-16 10:20:38	+Tatsh	http://sg80bab.blogspot.com/2007/03/is-my-mac-using-too-much-memory.html
2016-02-16 10:20:42	cookiemon5ter	if that makes sense :/
2016-02-16 10:20:56	+Tatsh	the same concept is used on Windows and Linux
2016-02-16 10:21:24	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: i don't see how they would be different , they're basically all the same design :p
2016-02-16 10:21:35	cnnx	basically as long as no swap is being used im good

2016-02-16 10:23:40	shadowdao	Sounds interesting.
2016-02-16 10:23:48	+Tatsh	my server has 16 GiB of RAM
2016-02-16 10:23:49	+Tatsh	              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

2016-02-16 10:24:42	+Tatsh	makes sense: subtract buff/cache, shared, and used from 16 and you get the that 'free' value
2016-02-16 10:24:47	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: how long has your pc been running?

2016-02-16 10:26:21	+stintel	haha and sometimes 1 browser isn't enough
2016-02-16 10:26:26	+Tatsh	subtract the values, and you get the `free` value, but in reality 25G is available for the taking
2016-02-16 10:26:34	+stintel	if your employer uses silly things that only has chrome webapps
2016-02-16 10:26:45	+Tatsh	it's a cooperative use of memory, as the kernel will release cached entries as more memory gets allocated by new apps
2016-02-16 10:27:12	cookiemon5ter	stintel: i don't mine using multiple browsers, i just hate crappy sites, which is most of them lately
2016-02-16 10:27:30	+Tatsh	it would be inefficient if it were like 'save memory as much as possible' like in the old days
2016-02-16 10:27:40	+stintel	cookiemon5ter: I don't really mind either, unless I am running on battery
2016-02-16 10:27:57	+Tatsh	but even in the old days, games would always just layout their memory at launch and use it appropriately; no memory was really 'free'
2016-02-16 10:27:59	+stintel	2 browsers decreases battery life
2016-02-16 10:28:04	+stintel	by a lot

2016-02-16 10:29:23	+Tatsh	right now you can compile your code with emscripten from C/C++ and get highly optimised JS, but only for x86 arch
2016-02-16 10:29:40	cookiemon5ter	programming is a terrible career choice
2016-02-16 10:29:51	+Tatsh	besides the stricter data types, what was the point of making ES better?
2016-02-16 10:30:01	+Tatsh	and the number is still IEEE 754 floating point
2016-02-16 10:30:16	+Tatsh	and you hack like `var a = someValue|0`

2016-02-16 10:35:53	+Tatsh	cookiemon5ter, i had a difficult somewhat maths-based question at the interview and i could not get the exact right answer
2016-02-16 10:36:25	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: probably best to admit you don't know and say you can figure it out if needed
2016-02-16 10:36:26	+Tatsh	the answer they wanted was to do sort of an algorithm where you use previously calculated data to retrieve the next value, recursively
2016-02-16 10:36:47	+Tatsh	it had to do with calcuating a square root, but not having so many CPU cycles in doing so
2016-02-16 10:36:57	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: some people find value in rote-memorization and others find value in people who rote-memorize :p
2016-02-16 10:37:07	+Tatsh	mainly because i had a loop that would take too much time and wasn't recursive
2016-02-16 10:37:37	+Tatsh	and the answer for solving a sqrt could be that you do a reduction based on a simplified 'last' value
2016-02-16 10:38:01	+Tatsh	sort of like Newton's method
2016-02-16 10:38:11	cookiemon5ter	sounds pretty cool
2016-02-16 10:38:32	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: there's actually people out there that play with the stuff all day ;)
2016-02-16 10:38:34	+Tatsh	basically that is what it was, but they didn't say that; i was sort of thinking that during the interview, but i could not remember newton's method exactly
2016-02-16 10:38:48	+Tatsh	otherwise i would've at least written the equation, but not the code
2016-02-16 10:38:52	+Tatsh	that might've been good enough
2016-02-16 10:39:10	+Tatsh	but since i asked a bunch of things, and 'admitted what i don't know', they hired me
2016-02-16 10:39:18	cookiemon5ter	omg why are so many people buying my stuff on ebay today
2016-02-16 10:39:32	cookiemon5ter	now i'm gonna have to ship all this stuff tomorrow :p

2016-02-16 10:45:04	shadowdao	That's debatable.
2016-02-16 10:45:10	+Tatsh	with grsec, say a non-root program needs to do something 'unusual' with memory, namely marking some area of memory as rwx, it's all or nothing
2016-02-16 10:45:20	+Tatsh	meaning, you assign a UID that is allowed to do that other than 0, or you disable the feature
2016-02-16 10:45:38	shadowdao	PaX handles that.
2016-02-16 10:45:52	shadowdao	RBAC has hooks for it, though.
2016-02-16 10:47:06	cookiemon5ter	Tatsh: seems like the right step for the future

2016-02-16 11:36:32	Coburn	One thing I'll suggest is to emulate your setup using your own hardware first before commiting to buy. You may think that you can pull it off, but on my server which is a first-gen Xeon 5240 and 4GB RAM, it's rather limiting.

2016-02-16 11:37:20	Coburn	I rent it from a datacenteer. I don't have the money to build my own rackmount
2016-02-16 11:37:21	SpaceToast	and SunSpider isn't great
2016-02-16 11:37:25	cnnx	ive been leasing a dedicated server the past year or two for a few websites of mine
2016-02-16 11:37:32	Coburn	Specs?
2016-02-16 11:37:36	cnnx	very low
2016-02-16 11:37:39	cnnx	16$/month
2016-02-16 11:37:41	cnnx	but its dedicated
2016-02-16 11:37:46	cnnx	4 gb ram
2016-02-16 11:37:48	Coburn	Yep, is it an atom or something?
2016-02-16 11:37:58	cnnx	bit better i think
2016-02-16 11:38:00	cnnx	let me check
2016-02-16 11:38:18	cnnx	root@ovh:~# cat /proc/cpuinfo|grep -i bogo
2016-02-16 11:38:18	cnnx	bogomips	: 3600.04
2016-02-16 11:38:18	cnnx	bogomips	: 3600.04
2016-02-16 11:38:23	cnnx	looks like 2 threads/cores
2016-02-16 11:38:34	cnnx	would have to look up model # of cpu
2016-02-16 11:38:45	cnnx	but load times are low
2016-02-16 11:38:49	cnnx	i have low traffic
2016-02-16 11:39:10	+Griz64	cnnx, lshw | less   will give you the info you want.
2016-02-16 11:39:42	cnnx	          product: Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU D425   @ 1.80GHz
2016-02-16 11:39:46	cnnx	Coburn: you were right, atom
2016-02-16 11:39:50	cnnx	wow, its pretty fast for atom
2016-02-16 11:39:55	cnnx	it handles all my sites well
2016-02-16 11:40:10	Coburn	What I'd recommend is if you want to get into VMs, check out KVM and go from there. Xen, while it is a good hypervisor does get a lot of exploits. KVM is maintained regularly, and you get a lot of performance boosts if you use virtio
2016-02-16 11:40:12	cnnx	Griz64: ty
2016-02-16 11:40:25	cnnx	i really like virtual box
2016-02-16 11:40:26	+Griz64	cnnx, You are Welcome.
2016-02-16 11:40:34	cnnx	was going to lease a server with 16 ips
2016-02-16 11:40:38	cnnx	and allocate them to vms
2016-02-16 11:40:41	cnnx	good specs
2016-02-16 11:40:42	cnnx	ssd
2016-02-16 11:40:42	cnnx	etc
2016-02-16 11:40:45	cnnx	for like 50$/month
2016-02-16 11:40:46	SpaceToast	>virtualbox
2016-02-16 11:40:54	SpaceToast	>good specs on atom
2016-02-16 11:40:56	Coburn	I'd honestly recommend KVM
2016-02-16 11:41:01	SpaceToast	KVM is the way to go
2016-02-16 11:41:02	Coburn	And you'd need Xeon or something
2016-02-16 11:41:09	cnnx	Coburn: kvm is in portage?
2016-02-16 11:41:10	SpaceToast	Xen if you don't want to into manually setting KVM up
2016-02-16 11:41:20	SpaceToast	you definitely want a xeon
2016-02-16 11:41:24	cnnx	yes xeon for sure
2016-02-16 11:41:31	SpaceToast	preferably an e7v3, but that's just my opinion
2016-02-16 11:41:32	Coburn	SpaceToast: Or he can use VNC and run virt-manager GUI :)
2016-02-16 11:41:37	SpaceToast	NO >:
2016-02-16 11:41:45	cnnx	virt-manager isnt that libvirt
2016-02-16 11:41:50	Coburn	yes
2016-02-16 11:41:51	SpaceToast	bad Coburn ! :3c
2016-02-16 11:42:20	cnnx	you can start up vm's headless with cli with virtualbox
2016-02-16 11:42:20	SpaceToast	meanwhile, I found yet another thing to dislike in windows 10 as opposed to prior iterations \o/
2016-02-16 11:42:21	Coburn	For example, my server says "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           L5630  @ 2.13GHz"
2016-02-16 11:42:23	cnnx	VBoxmanage
2016-02-16 11:42:50	Coburn	CPU(s):                8; On-line CPU(s) list:   0-7; Thread(s) per core:    2; Core(s) per socket:    4
2016-02-16 11:43:07	SpaceToast	yeah but...
2016-02-16 11:43:20	Coburn	TBH I wouldn't use VirtualBox in production
2016-02-16 11:43:24	Coburn	It's Oracle
2016-02-16 11:43:30	Coburn	It's the same guys that maintain Java
2016-02-16 11:43:37	Coburn	See what I'm getting at ? :P
2016-02-16 11:44:08	SpaceToast	I'd go with a E7-8880 v3
2016-02-16 11:44:37	SpaceToast	18 cores, 36 threads, 45mb L3, 2.3 - 3.1GHz
2016-02-16 11:45:04	SpaceToast	up to 1.5TB of RAM (kinda required for certain applications, though you'd probably use datalakes at that point)
2016-02-16 11:45:16	SpaceToast	of course you'd get it with ECC
2016-02-16 11:45:30	SpaceToast	and then you put 8 of those on the same board (if possible)
2016-02-16 11:45:38	SpaceToast	(don't remember the situation with motherboards)
2016-02-16 11:45:45	cnnx	SpaceToast: so xen or virtlib?
2016-02-16 11:46:00	cnnx	i meant to Coburn
2016-02-16 11:46:12	SpaceToast	c and s are easy to confuse I hear, snnx ;)
2016-02-16 11:46:26	Coburn	cnnx: I'm a KVM person myself.
2016-02-16 11:46:41	SpaceToast	and that question is kinda irrelevant imo
2016-02-16 11:46:48	Coburn	Xen is well, like I said, works well but BE PREPARED TO PATCH IT EVERY CRITICAL PATCH :P
2016-02-16 11:46:54	SpaceToast	I'd KVM/QEMU
2016-02-16 11:46:55	Coburn	That means server reboot
2016-02-16 11:47:05	cnnx	Coburn: so i can practice tonight by installing debian.iso into a libvirt instance vm?
2016-02-16 11:47:08	cnnx	is that ok?
2016-02-16 11:47:11	Coburn	Yes
2016-02-16 11:47:17	cnnx	ok ty
2016-02-16 11:47:27	Coburn	What i'd recommend is, on a GUI install

2016-02-16 11:48:26	Coburn	Segfault / Windows "This app stopped working"
2016-02-16 11:48:36	Coburn	Where was I?
2016-02-16 11:48:48	Coburn	Oh yeah. What I'd recommend is using virt-manager-gui
2016-02-16 11:48:59	Coburn	Learn that, as that's a frontend to libvirt and virtsh
2016-02-16 11:49:19	cnnx	Coburn: ok i find virtualbox has a nicer gui, but if libvirt is more stable then...
2016-02-16 11:49:28	Coburn	libvirt runs inside the kernel
2016-02-16 11:49:36	cnnx	libvert can allocate vm ram dynamically?
2016-02-16 11:49:41	cnnx	or static only like virtualbox
2016-02-16 11:49:42	Coburn	It uses a 'balloon' driver
2016-02-16 11:50:10	Coburn	AFAIK if you give it 8GB of RAM, it won't eat 8GB at boot (if I'm correct)
2016-02-16 11:50:24	SpaceToast	virtualbox and vmware are both terrible
2016-02-16 11:50:35	+Tatsh	i think vbox is slightly better
2016-02-16 11:50:41	SpaceToast	compared to vmware, sure
2016-02-16 11:50:42	+Tatsh	for the end user
2016-02-16 11:50:43	SpaceToast	but both are terrible
2016-02-16 11:50:51	Coburn	VirtualBox has unhelpful errors
2016-02-16 11:50:57	+Tatsh	and stupid corruptions
2016-02-16 11:51:00	Coburn	Like "Failed to attach X to Y"
2016-02-16 11:51:07	SpaceToast	userspace level hypervisors, lol
2016-02-16 11:51:10	Coburn	E_CONN_FAIL
2016-02-16 11:51:26	+Tatsh	or 'sorry your file is unreadable. you should delete it'
2016-02-16 11:51:30	Coburn	while KVM is like "Nope, I can't do that, want me to nuke QEMU and start her up again?"
2016-02-16 11:51:52	cnnx	is it called KVM or libvirt? im confused
2016-02-16 11:52:05	Coburn	KVM is the kernel thing, libvirt is a management set

2016-02-16 22:12:07	redeyedman	enjoy not having your logrotate
2016-02-16 22:15:06	+_anomaly_	i love those few apps that don't hold the fd open on the log, don't detect logrotate renamed it, and don't bother recreating it because their init script handles that.. so they just stop logging altogether when logreotate runs
2016-02-16 22:15:08	+Moult	in other newbie questions - there is something odd about this wifi i'm on that i keep on timing out in my ssh sessions. it's definitely something specific to this wifi hotspot. any ideas of what to check? (i have access to the router admin)
2016-02-16 22:16:53	+Tear	oh, i actually really garbled that filename, missing asterisks, double quotes and backslashes

2016-02-16 22:35:18	nebg	hello everyone... i'm new into computer security... and wanted to know if there is an actual walkthrough to Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) since  i cannot find anything online... only pieces of information but not a complete guide/tutorial which explains step by step... can somebody tell me if there is one ? or if there are alternatives to this project who actually even have documentation ?
2016-02-16 22:36:01	+wiktor_b	Moult: maybe the you disconnect from the AP briefly, get a new IP address, then your connections hang

2016-02-17 00:16:07	+dugz	make sure your tree is consistent. /mnt/gentoo & /mnt/gentoo/home  if you are attempting to do a chroot install, adjust values in /etc/fstab to reflect a running system
2016-02-17 00:18:14	Guest13913	dugz:  is that mean i am doing it wrong? i haven't reach to the fstab part installation yet. just the beginning..

2016-02-17 00:35:55	+doc235	hey, i have a computer here (dell vostro 200) that has the old molex power connectors for drives and i need the newer sata cable connector. what would i look for to adapt them?
2016-02-17 00:36:08	+doc235	i have 1 adapter i bought years ago but need another
2016-02-17 00:39:22	+dugz	I need one of those things too. molex to sata power adapter I guess
2016-02-17 00:41:37	+Griz64	doc235, one of the reasons us oldepharts keep some dead parts. ;-)  cut the cables off of dead PSU's and make all sorts of adapters.
2016-02-17 00:42:15	+Tear	i had a similar problem lately, my psu came with 2x molex and a 2x molex to 6pin adapter
2016-02-17 00:42:29	+doc235	yea, adapters are easier Griz64  :) but capable of doing it if absolutely needed
2016-02-17 00:42:51	+Tear	obviously expecting that everyone with a graphics card modern enough to need 2x 6pin would not need molex

2016-02-17 00:55:29	+dugz	Guest13913, before booting, you bind you shell to the new environment using the chroot command. this enables setup and installation on a system without a bootable kernel

2016-02-17 01:47:29	+nebg	i am configuring the kernel and searched for brcm
2016-02-17 01:47:34	+nebg	and added all the modules...
2016-02-17 01:47:37	+nebg	with yes or module
2016-02-17 01:47:54	+nebg	but when i boot it tells it failed to load the firmware of my wlan nic
2016-02-17 01:48:05	+nebg	anyway i can see the interface with ifconfig -a
2016-02-17 01:48:12	+nebg	any idea ?
2016-02-17 01:49:06	+tmn_	You need the firmware files for the device.
2016-02-17 01:49:16	+tmn_	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wifi#Firmware
2016-02-17 01:50:40	+hosler	nebg: i think the package you want is linux-firmware
2016-02-17 01:51:36	+nebg	hosler,  i have it
2016-02-17 01:51:46	+hosler	is it a super new wifi card?
2016-02-17 01:51:59	+hosler	you might want to use unstable firmware package if it is
2016-02-17 01:52:08	+Griz64	nebg, look thru the log files (messages, syslog, kernel.log)
2016-02-17 01:52:11	+hosler	or use the 99999 package to pull is straight from git
2016-02-17 01:52:42	+iamben	nebg: broadcom makes lots of cards, there are several different drivers.  each has different firmware needs, and also i was curious if your current driver was built-in or modular
2016-02-17 01:52:51	+iamben	dmesg would have answered a lot of questions all at once, that's all
2016-02-17 01:52:57	+hosler	gotta be a module
2016-02-17 01:53:18	+nebg	iamben, one question... do those drivers should be loaded as modules or built-in ?=
2016-02-17 01:53:24	+hosler	modules
2016-02-17 01:54:02	+iamben	modules are easier, otherwise you have to bake in the required firmwares @ kernel build time
2016-02-17 01:54:16	+iamben	built-in will initialize before rootfs & /lib/firmware are up
2016-02-17 01:54:17	+nebg	iamben, which is the tradeoff here =
2016-02-17 01:54:18	+nebg	?
2016-02-17 01:54:31	+nebg	iamben, do i need an initial ram disk for that ?
2016-02-17 01:54:39	+iamben	also wifi drivers can be crazy in general, so being able to reload as needed is a bonus
2016-02-17 01:54:54	+hosler	gawd i hate linux users
2016-02-17 01:54:56	+iamben	no, no initramfs needed since wifi isn't critical for bot

2016-02-17 02:21:50	Guest13913	how do i disable ipv6 in kernel,
2016-02-17 02:23:06	+hosler	well there is a very specific option
2016-02-17 02:23:13	+hosler	i think it's called ipv6
2016-02-17 02:23:28	Guest13913	sigh! hosler
2016-02-17 02:23:39	Guest13913	how stupid i am

2016-02-17 02:24:08	+hosler	or you can disable it via cmdline in grub
2016-02-17 02:24:11	+iamben	Guest13913: hit "/" to search, search for ipv6 or ^ipv6$ to be precise
2016-02-17 02:24:21	Guest13913	ok
2016-02-17 02:25:11	Guest13913	Building an initramfs , is this useful thing? and why would someone follow?
2016-02-17 02:25:18	+hosler	i dont use one
2016-02-17 02:25:29	+hosler	the only time i used it was for framebuffer candy
2016-02-17 02:26:10	+hosler	some people require their fs drivers be modules. so they need one.
2016-02-17 02:26:33	+iamben	Guest13913: it's mostly used when you need some userspace helpers to bring up your rootfs, like if your important drivers are modular or you have rootfs on raid/lvm/crypt and need those tools to bring it up
2016-02-17 02:26:52	+iamben	if you use genkernel then it builds a lot of vital stuff as modules, so you need the initramfs it provides
2016-02-17 02:28:03	+hosler	some day ill be as good at explaining things as iamben is
2016-02-17 02:28:19	+iamben	im just very verbose
2016-02-17 02:28:27	bluearc	iamben:  It helps!
2016-02-17 02:28:34	+hosler	halfway through my explanations i realize i just dont care
2016-02-17 02:28:45	*	bluearc usually builds a genkernel first, just to get a working kernel
2016-02-17 02:28:49	Guest13913	iamben: thats a gift you have
2016-02-17 02:29:06	+wiktor_b	sometimes verbosity is a curse
2016-02-17 02:29:18	+hosler	bluearc: bruh, my last 3 kernels booted first try

2016-02-17 02:29:22	Guest13913	iamben: i am on manual kernel. no genkernel , i didn't choose even at first place
2016-02-17 02:29:37	bluearc	hosler:  I'm getting to that point!  :-)
2016-02-17 02:30:01	bluearc	 Should I switch my default python (eselect python) to 3.4 from 2.7?   A new gentoo install still defaults to 2.7 ......
2016-02-17 02:30:05	Guest13913	in etc/fstab i am adding /home directory ,
2016-02-17 02:30:17	+hosler	bluearc: 2.7 for life
2016-02-17 02:30:18	+iamben	bluearc: emerge will run a little bit faster if you use 3.4
2016-02-17 02:30:22	+hosler	wat
2016-02-17 02:30:27	+dugz	I just switched a VM to syslinux and the kernel panicked :/
2016-02-17 02:30:35	+iamben	and use a bit less memory on many-files emerges
2016-02-17 02:31:03	Guest13913	iamben: "/dev/sdb1    /home    ext4   noauto,native 1 2 " is this ok?
2016-02-17 02:31:09	+hosler	for some reasoni  thought python3 broke emerge
2016-02-17 02:31:50	+hosler	Guest13913: take ouyt noauto
2016-02-17 02:31:58	+iamben	hosler: it did several years ago
2016-02-17 02:32:13	+iamben	Guest13913: what is "native"?
2016-02-17 02:32:18	+hosler	yeah native isnt anything
2016-02-17 02:32:34	Guest13913	hosler: ok , it has just noatime now... with 1 2
2016-02-17 02:32:48	+iamben	just use "defaults" unless you have a good reason to do otherwise
2016-02-17 02:33:54	+hosler	just use "defaults" unless you have a good reason to do otherwise
2016-02-17 02:34:38	+iamben	^ im with hosler
2016-02-17 02:34:45	+hosler	im so good at this
2016-02-17 02:35:11	+wiktor_b	noatime is good, though
2016-02-17 02:35:23	+iamben	relatime is the default which is better in some ways
2016-02-17 02:35:25	+wiktor_b	unless you want atimes
2016-02-17 02:35:46	+wiktor_b	once again, it all depends on what you want from your system :)
2016-02-17 02:35:48	+iamben	relatime almost never updates the atime, only when the current atime older than the modified time, iirc
2016-02-17 02:36:03	+wiktor_b	Guest13913: stick with "defaults" until you figure out if you want to toggle some option or not
2016-02-17 02:36:03		[02:36]
2016-02-17 02:36:05	+iamben	total noatime makes some certain scenario explode, i cant remember what
2016-02-17 02:36:06	+hosler	i usually just use whatever the stage3 defaults are
2016-02-17 02:36:27	+wiktor_b	iamben: a few tools monitor atimes
2016-02-17 02:37:52	+iamben	wiktor_b: like stuff that hasn't been properly updated to use kernel FAM stuff/
2016-02-17 02:37:55	+iamben	?
2016-02-17 02:38:35	+wiktor_b	iamben: not always: only the tools that want to know if a file has been opened
2016-02-17 02:38:43	+wiktor_b	iamben: hmm there was something about mail
2016-02-17 02:39:12	+wiktor_b	mutt!
2016-02-17 02:39:17	+wiktor_b	mutt breaks with noatime
2016-02-17 02:39:48	+iamben	it was also something mail-related which broke with noatime but works ok with relatime
2016-02-17 02:40:44	+wiktor_b	it was mutt

2016-02-17 02:51:14	+iamben	really though, i appreciate that musl exists but at this time i have no interest in exploring it myself
2016-02-17 02:51:18	cnnx	dugz: in freecad the way you rotate the image is you hold the alt key down, then grab your object with the mouse and move it while the alt key is pressed
2016-02-17 02:52:20	cnnx	anyone knwo what this means in aqemu when i start my vm?
2016-02-17 02:52:22	cnnx	Warning: vlan 1 is not connected to host network
2016-02-17 02:52:34	+wiktor_b	one day we'll take over, and you'll be googling for patches how to build something against the legacy "geeleebsee"
2016-02-17 02:54:11	+iamben	i noticed a package i maintain mcelog just got an update for "More fixes for %ll instead of %L in *printf to support musl libc."
2016-02-17 02:54:43	+wiktor_b	but all you'll get is a message "just switch to something sane and sensible and standard"

2016-02-17 02:55:41	+wiktor_b	iamben: is that a bad thing?
2016-02-17 02:55:45	+iamben	nope
2016-02-17 02:56:03	+iamben	but i will continue to give you trouble about it, just so you know
2016-02-17 02:56:16	+dugz	yes! i degrubbed my debugging VMs and installed nice simple syslinux.cfg
2016-02-17 02:57:12	+dugz	not adding real_root=/dev/foo was getting me
2016-02-17 02:57:33	+wiktor_b	iamben: very well
2016-02-17 02:57:46	+wiktor_b	iamben: the friction is important
2016-02-17 02:57:51	+wiktor_b	iamben: it keeps everyone going
2016-02-17 02:57:56	+wiktor_b	iamben: just like the systemd hate
2016-02-17 02:58:46	+iamben	recently on gentoo-dev ML, one dev accused another of being on systemd/redhat payroll, for suggesting we stay on sys-fs/udev until it has real problems
2016-02-17 02:59:42	+doc235	:/
2016-02-17 02:59:47	+wiktor_b	let's not get into this
2016-02-17 02:59:52	+Chainsaw	It already has real problems.
2016-02-17 02:59:58	+wiktor_b	PLEASE
2016-02-17 03:00:18	+iamben	i didnt suggest it had no problems, i was just recalling what happened on the ML
2016-02-17 03:00:30	+wiktor_b	iamben: I know, I follow the ml
2016-02-17 03:00:53	+wiktor_b	I think the friction is important because the grinding means the cogs are turning
2016-02-17 03:01:14	+wiktor_b	if everyone just decided systemd is blackjack and hookers, it'd stagnate
2016-02-17 03:02:34	+wiktor_b	this community works only because there are competing groups trying to make "the best" whatever
2016-02-17 03:02:40	+wiktor_b	just like good ol' captialism

2016-02-17 03:06:23	+wiktor_b	pa and jack are aimed at different markets, really only alsa and oss are in any sort of way competing
2016-02-17 03:06:23		[03:06]
2016-02-17 03:06:30	+wiktor_b	and oss is basically dead on linux anyway
2016-02-17 03:06:41	+iamben	in some ways i consider alsa & PA to be competing
2016-02-17 03:06:51	+iamben	yes im aware of how PA sits atop alsa =)
2016-02-17 03:07:19	+wiktor_b	iamben: broken alsa breaks pa, broken pa can be fixed by uninstalling it :)
2016-02-17 03:07:39	+wiktor_b	iamben: I actually put pa on a bunch of boxes recently and it's actually not too bad, when it works
2016-02-17 03:07:58	+wiktor_b	iamben: I like the idea somewhat, the execution can be quite questionable, especially a few years ago
2016-02-17 03:08:12	+iamben	yeah it was pretty wonky when it was unleashed on ubuntu et al
2016-02-17 03:08:25	+iamben	seems pretty solid these days, though im not currently using it
2016-02-17 03:08:34	+wiktor_b	same with systemd imho
2016-02-17 03:08:46	+iamben	but it makes a lot of sense if you're plugging usb headsets, bluetooth speakers, etc etc
2016-02-17 03:08:48	+wiktor_b	it started being pushed out too aggressively, too early
2016-02-17 03:08:56	+iamben	agreed
2016-02-17 03:09:02	+wiktor_b	iamben: and TVs over HDMI
2016-02-17 03:09:23	+iamben	ah yeah that's quite common too
2016-02-17 03:09:30	+wiktor_b	which, surprisingly to me, turns out is quite a common thing people do :)
2016-02-17 03:10:37	+wiktor_b	but yeah, systemd should've been left to brew a bit longer, and maybe if it wasn't being so marketoized so violently, it would've got much better feedback from the current haters
2016-02-17 03:12:48	+hosler	the only reason i hate systemd is because it broke my system resume/suspend/hibernate
2016-02-17 03:12:56	+wiktor_b	did someone mention unit file support in openrc?
2016-02-17 03:13:09	+wiktor_b	iamben: btw are you maintaining consolekit in gentoo?
2016-02-17 03:13:20	+iamben	wiktor_b: i have nothing to do with that
2016-02-17 03:13:26	+wiktor_b	iamben: sorry
2016-02-17 03:13:43	+iamben	i use it, that's all
2016-02-17 03:14:10	+wiktor_b	still not on systemd?
2016-02-17 03:14:29	+wiktor_b	oh, it's perfinion :)
2016-02-17 03:14:34	+iamben	i have some on systemd, some on openrc

2016-02-17 03:34:52	+iamben	Guest13913: can you pastebin the kernel .config and lspci -k output from a livecd?
2016-02-17 03:35:19	+iamben	nebg: what is the default now, and what do you want the default to be?
2016-02-17 03:35:21	Guest13913	iamben: not sure how can i do that from installation CD
2016-02-17 03:35:27	+wiktor_b	perfinion: shhhh, hush now
2016-02-17 03:35:34	+wiktor_b	perfinion: the consolekit maintainer :)
2016-02-17 03:35:46	+perfinion	wiktor_b: ooh
2016-02-17 03:35:55	+perfinion	wiktor_b: anything about it?
2016-02-17 03:36:10	+iamben	Guest13913: wgetpaste /mnt/gentoo/usr/src/linux/.config
2016-02-17 03:36:12	+dugz	do kernel.old -> symlinks and friends have to already be present for genkernel to update them?
2016-02-17 03:36:16	+iamben	wgetpaste -c lspci -k
2016-02-17 03:36:25	+wiktor_b	perfinion: no, not really, we were just having a conversation about systemd and that
2016-02-17 03:36:26	+nebg	iamben, i have my kernels in /boot, one is vmlinuz-4.1 and the other one is vmlinuz-4.1-brcm
2016-02-17 03:36:35	+wiktor_b	perfinion: not the typical mud slinging, tho
2016-02-17 03:36:58	+iamben	nebg: an easy fix would be to just chagne the name of vmlinuz-4.1
2016-02-17 03:37:00	+perfinion	wiktor_b: ah ok cool
2016-02-17 03:37:05	+iamben	to make it come before or after the brcm one
2016-02-17 03:37:18	+iamben	btw you should stop asking the same question in 2 channels at once

2016-02-17 03:49:08	+iamben	Guest13913: i think FUSION_SAS is what you need
2016-02-17 03:49:23	Guest13913	iamben: fusion sas is enabled , version 3?
2016-02-17 03:49:35	+iamben	Guest13913: where do you see that?

2016-02-17 03:49:46	+dugz	if you don't know what hardware you have, i suggest you build the kitchen sink kernel using genkernel
2016-02-17 03:49:50	+iamben	i see in your kernel config:  # CONFIG_FUSION is not set
2016-02-17 03:50:04	+wiktor_b	the fusion stuff is :(
2016-02-17 03:50:10	+wiktor_b	the hardware is quite sucky in my experience
2016-02-17 03:50:31	+wiktor_b	Guest13913: ^ but yeah iamben is telling you the right things
2016-02-17 03:51:09	Guest13913	iamben: scsi device support -- > SCSI low level drivers--->  LSI MPT Fusion
2016-02-17 03:51:29	Guest13913	wiktor_b: i trust him 100% and i am sure its my mistake..
2016-02-17 03:52:06	+iamben	Guest13913: that's not the right place, hit "/" and search for FUSION_SAS
2016-02-17 03:52:32	+wiktor_b	IIRC you need both the SCSI driver and the SAS driver for fusion to work
2016-02-17 03:53:07	Guest13913	iamben: thats the one, fusion MPT devoice which i said not enabled.. got it now..will re do that now

2016-02-17 06:00:35	salviadud	This is original content from me.
2016-02-17 06:00:45	+hosler	ok
2016-02-17 06:01:38	salviadud	So, I was checking out stileproject.com cause I was bored, and there was this tab that said "meet and #!%#" as you might imagine, it sent me to a dating site, but not just any dating site, a modern dating site, with pr0n.
2016-02-17 06:02:24	salviadud	So, the site asked me to put in a credit card to prove my age, and that no charges would come of said transaction.  I followed instructions and put in my info.
2016-02-17 06:02:59	salviadud	A few days later I noticed that some other website called csfollow.com charged me like 50 bucks.  And I was like, HELL NO, this is wrong.
2016-02-17 06:02:59		[06:02]
2016-02-17 06:03:46	salviadud	I complained to the bank, they told me to follow some really long procedure involving me writing down stuff on paper and taking scans of it, with my signature.

2016-02-17 06:20:05	+Chainsaw	iamben: Doubtful, it's automated.
2016-02-17 06:20:41	+Smiley	only time i saw that message was whedn someones machine was sending spam :/
2016-02-17 06:20:58	+iamben	Chainsaw: well yeah that's why a WHITELIST would be appropriate, for overriding the automation
2016-02-17 06:21:02	+Smiley	this was a office of about 100 machines (desktops) and then numerous servers (most servers having a seperate public IP but not all).
2016-02-17 06:21:17	+Smiley	iamben: and you expect google to trust you, over their automation (which mostly works).
2016-02-17 06:21:18	+Chainsaw	iamben: You expect HUMAN behaviour out of a faceless machine like Google?
2016-02-17 06:21:33	+iamben	you guys have been most helpful
2016-02-17 06:21:40	+Chainsaw	We aim to please.
2016-02-17 06:21:41	*	mvaenskae finally has a prophecy
2016-02-17 06:21:58	+Smiley	iamben: the short answer is 'no'
2016-02-17 06:21:59	+Smiley	:/
2016-02-17 06:22:00	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: Let's hear it.
2016-02-17 06:22:10	+Chainsaw	Smiley: The long answer is "Nooooooooo" whilst running in slow motion.
2016-02-17 06:22:11	+iamben	Smiley: do you have any evidence to back that up, or are you just assuming?
2016-02-17 06:22:46	mvaenskae	Chainsaw: https://goo.gl/mgnRVV
2016-02-17 06:23:06	+Smiley	iamben: in sometime between Nov 2010 and Aug 2013 I went looking myself, and came up with 'nope'
2016-02-17 06:23:10	mvaenskae	if link shortening is not wanted i will post full links :)
2016-02-17 06:23:10	+iamben	we are not a small company, we can throw around some weight or money ifneeded
2016-02-17 06:23:21	+Smiley	i only klnow thje dates as I'm looking at my CV right now.
2016-02-17 06:23:26	+iamben	we are a pretty big adsense customer too
2016-02-17 06:23:44	+Smiley	Even being registered as an ISP and having our own BGP allocation didn't hjelp.
2016-02-17 06:23:46	+Chainsaw	iamben: Personally I would spend the money on a block of IP addresses and spread the traffic out a bit, even in the same /24 that'll help a *lot*.
2016-02-17 06:24:28	+iamben	well the blocking has subsided for now
2016-02-17 06:24:47	mvaenskae	Chainsaw: interesting prophecy? :D
2016-02-17 06:25:16	+Chainsaw	iamben: Most SMTP "IP reputation" systems work the same way, so try and keep that traffic flow away until you've fixed that.
2016-02-17 06:25:40	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: I was expecting something more... profound.
2016-02-17 06:26:09	mvaenskae	Chainsaw: that will likely give me a lot more interesting ones though ;)
2016-02-17 06:26:11	+iamben	Chainsaw: well mail/smtp goes out another pipe so at least it doesn't affect that
2016-02-17 06:26:18	+Smiley	But, with 4000-5000 systems, are you SURE one isn't spamming?
2016-02-17 06:26:24	+doc235	what is more profound than a bottle of godo whisky
2016-02-17 06:26:31	+iamben	Smiley: spamming what? google queries?
2016-02-17 06:26:33	mvaenskae	doc235: godo?
2016-02-17 06:26:41	+doc235	good
2016-02-17 06:26:51	mvaenskae	it was 20% off so i thought i should give it a try

2016-02-17 06:27:13	+Smiley	= $$$
2016-02-17 06:27:22	+doc235	i bought a bottle of bad whisky once. it was BAD
2016-02-17 06:27:31	+iamben	i suppose anythign is possible
2016-02-17 06:27:45	mvaenskae	doc235: it was in the highland park range of price and i wanted something peaty again
2016-02-17 06:27:49	+Smiley	I'm not saying one of the systems IS, but thats the ONLY time I saw that message :/
2016-02-17 06:28:11	+Smiley	Ofcourse, if someone just emailed out  a google.com/s=blah link then maybe that flicked it, but I presume you've hit this multiple times?
2016-02-17 06:28:12	+iamben	we have about 10k employees and we go out through only 2 IPs
2016-02-17 06:28:21	+Chainsaw	doc235: I have never had a bad highland whisky.
2016-02-17 06:28:36	+Smiley	iamben: and it wasn't a problem until recently?
2016-02-17 06:28:37	+Chainsaw	doc235: And I have tried quite a few of them.
2016-02-17 06:28:44	+iamben	Smiley: it doesn't happen a lot but it's happened more than once
2016-02-17 06:29:08	+Smiley	infact IIRC (it was a few years ago) the issue came down to the guy who had adware had actually got rid of it
2016-02-17 06:29:18	mvaenskae	Chainsaw: there was also the highland park einar as a selection
2016-02-17 06:29:36	+Smiley	however upon opening IE it still had a fake referrer set, and would open about 10 IE windows all doing some dodgy query via 3rd party site (XSS? something else? I never figured it out).
2016-02-17 06:30:04	+Smiley	After I just reset his home page and fixed the referrer, all was good again.

2016-02-17 08:18:23	+hosler	fearedbliss: im looking at your overlay on github
2016-02-17 08:18:28	+hosler	its a whole minor version behind
2016-02-17 08:18:29	fearedbliss	hosler: btw, the way I decide when to make a new release is by checking the currently available version of plex that plex advertises
2016-02-17 08:18:43	fearedbliss	hosler: yea plex isnt advertising 0.9.15.3 so I'm not going to push that yet
2016-02-17 08:18:52	fearedbliss	hosler: there is probably a reason they havent updated their stable release page
2016-02-17 08:19:08	+doc235	i can't read the mobo even with my glasses :/
2016-02-17 08:19:09	fearedbliss	plex.tv/downloads
2016-02-17 08:19:32	fearedbliss	0.9.15.2 - jan 22, 2016, latest stable advertised
2016-02-17 08:20:11	+iamben	doc235: the manual page shows which 2 pins it is
2016-02-17 08:20:14	fearedbliss	actually, nobody running plex stable will even receive an update prompt for .3 atm .. because like I said, it isnt actually released
2016-02-17 08:20:22	+iamben	so you dont need to read the mobo, just see the pins
2016-02-17 08:20:45	fearedbliss	Smiley: you have 0.9.15.2 running on your server?
2016-02-17 08:21:06	+Smiley	fearedbliss: atm dunno
2016-02-17 08:21:18	+Griz64	sure wished there was a way to speed up this update for my music, in Plex.  :-(
2016-02-17 08:21:58	fearedbliss	hosler: all I can say is be careful running a version not released through the stable channel
2016-02-17 08:22:21	fearedbliss	there prolly will be a 0.9.15.3 release but it might have a different major/minor code number after the laest .
2016-02-17 08:22:23	fearedbliss	last*
2016-02-17 08:23:01	+doc235	chapter 1 or chapter 2? the pages ar numbered wierd
2016-02-17 08:24:08	+iamben	doc235: page 17 in raw pdf pages, the section is 2.4.2, page says 2-7 at the bottom

2016-02-17 08:27:31	+Tear	it's the version for plex pass users
2016-02-17 08:27:39	+hosler	lol
2016-02-17 08:27:41	+Tear	i guess they didn't put in a check
2016-02-17 08:28:03	+Tear	it's not "unstable", it's just that free users are delayed
2016-02-17 08:28:49	+doc235	iamben, thanks that helped. i tried and no fan's in the psu or nywhere
2016-02-17 08:31:32	fearedbliss	Tear: I have plex lifetime and I'm not receiving it,it's also not advertised on the website
2016-02-17 08:31:38	fearedbliss	either way, I follow the normal channels
2016-02-17 08:32:20	fearedbliss	Tear: it's fine though, I didn't donate money to plex so I could get the "non-advertised" version, but just to help :)
2016-02-17 08:32:41	+Tear	hm, i guess you have to dig in for it
2016-02-17 08:32:49	fearedbliss	Tear: btw dont get me wrong, I didnt say 0.9.15.3 was unstable, I said it wasnt the advertised stab;e
2016-02-17 08:32:53	+hosler	fearedbliss: tiy gotta click the "plex pass downloads" button
2016-02-17 08:32:58	+hosler	it defaults to public downloads
2016-02-17 08:33:00	fearedbliss	it could be very well be stable, but it just hasnt been advertised
2016-02-17 08:33:24	fearedbliss	hosler: ah yea I see it now
2016-02-17 08:33:36	+iamben	doc235: if you're sure it's the PSU, I can probably send you one of those too
2016-02-17 08:33:49	+hosler	iamben: ill take 1 computer pls
2016-02-17 08:34:03	fearedbliss	hosler: I wonder if there would be any negative consequences if I use this channel instead of the public? I think there was some stuff about removing a file for non plex-pass users?
2016-02-17 08:34:16	fearedbliss	eeh.. I'm not in a rush.. plex already does everything I need through the normal channels
2016-02-17 08:34:19	fearedbliss	not a big deal
2016-02-17 08:34:22	+hosler	fearedbliss: griz doenst have plex pass and is using 15.3
2016-02-17 08:34:41	fearedbliss	hosler: if there is no problem, I'll switch over to plex pass channel
2016-02-17 08:34:41	+doc235	it is iamben pretty sure iamben. i was suspect it before anyway. and a standard atx mid-tower psu
2016-02-17 08:34:48	+Tear	i installed it without knowing it's supposed to be unavailable to me
2016-02-17 08:34:51	+Tear	and everything works fine
2016-02-17 08:35:07	fearedbliss	Tear: you didnt have to do anything special? logging into your regular account just worked?
2016-02-17 08:35:24	+Tear	it was an update from the overlay
2016-02-17 08:35:31	+Tear	and yeah nothing changed
2016-02-17 08:35:59	+Tear	i wish plex would let me choose what format and bitrate i want to transcode to, that would make me a lot more willing to get premium
2016-02-17 08:36:07	fearedbliss	Tear: hosler: alright cool, I'll give it a test and use the plex pass channel if no issues arise
2016-02-17 08:36:09	fearedbliss	thanks
2016-02-17 08:36:45	+Tear	on pc it always streams 320kbps mp3 which is a huge waste of bandwidth
2016-02-17 08:36:51	+Tear	which matters a lot on metered connections
2016-02-17 08:37:15	+hosler	Tear: in settings you can choose
2016-02-17 08:37:21	+Tear	only video
2016-02-17 08:37:25	+hosler	oh
2016-02-17 08:37:27	+hosler	that sucks
2016-02-17 08:37:51	+hosler	i never go over 2TB of montly bandwidth
2016-02-17 08:38:09	+Tear	i tether my mobile connection at work because it's actually faster than work internet. -_-
2016-02-17 08:38:17	+hosler	lol
2016-02-17 08:38:34	+hosler	yeah i can see that going sour fast with plex

2016-02-17 08:58:36	+FrostFeline	I could install kdenlive, It's like having a gentoo prefix.
2016-02-17 08:58:52	+FrostFeline	macports is to Mac OSX as Portage is to Gentoo
2016-02-17 08:59:17	+FrostFeline	A ports like automated build system.
2016-02-17 08:59:19	salviadud	I'm reading about it...

2016-02-17 09:38:27	+iamben	this isnt really an upgrade, and you dont need to rebuild rdeps for glibc upgrades anyway

2016-02-17 13:26:22	slicktux	:)
2016-02-17 13:26:36	arvut	I wonder if you can crossbreed hop with cannabis
2016-02-17 13:27:51	slicktux	arvut: I don't know about conventional crossbreed methods, but maybe genetic modification is possivle; take some RNA of weed and blast it into the hops DNA. . .
2016-02-17 13:28:04	slicktux	possible***
2016-02-17 13:28:24	slicktux	arvut: make for some DANK beer! totallyyyy duuudeeee!
2016-02-17 13:28:56	slicktux	arvut: eat bown/chouse burritous with some Arizone Iced Tea; its all about the Mango!
2016-02-17 13:29:21	arvut	according to a beer forum, its cause the beer is light struck, due to the green bottles
2016-02-17 13:29:35	slicktux	arvut: makes sense
2016-02-17 13:29:44	arvut	and a few other brands smells the same way
2016-02-17 13:30:03	slicktux	arvut: Kinda like Corona (thay use a clear Bottle) and it also gives of some weed smell.
2016-02-17 13:30:12	arvut	hmm
2016-02-17 13:30:23	arvut	I drink corona every now and then and never noticed
2016-02-17 13:30:31	slicktux	arvut: let is warm up
2016-02-17 13:30:43	arvut	but whenever I open a heineken glass bottle, that very familiar scent comes out
2016-02-17 13:30:51	arvut	warm beer? are you mad?
2016-02-17 13:31:14	slicktux	arvut: Hey, some beers taste goood warm; say IPA's. . .
2016-02-17 13:31:28	arvut	I keep mine in the freezer for 10 mins, always
2016-02-17 13:31:42	arvut	no, IPA should be cold as well, too much heavy bitterness otherwise
2016-02-17 13:31:48	arvut	but I don't really like IPA anyway
2016-02-17 13:32:01	arvut	I like cheap swill like heineken
2016-02-17 13:32:47	arvut	brooklyn half-beer is ok, its kinda different from other IPAs
2016-02-17 13:32:57	slicktux	arvut: yes, I've not had beer in a while, but next time I do I will go for a Dos X. . .
2016-02-17 13:33:00	arvut	I don't like their stronger beer though
2016-02-17 13:33:08	slicktux	;)
2016-02-17 13:33:27	slicktux	actually, I'll go for a Guinness or Old Rasputin; it's all about the stouts!

2016-02-17 13:45:17	slicktux	jrunyon: It was supposed to be a punch line, but I agree ew.
2016-02-17 13:45:26	slicktux	jrunyon: yes, modelo os great
2016-02-17 13:45:31	+jrunyon	lol in that case it's acceptable

2016-02-17 16:59:32	redcheckers	a paperweight, that doubles as an aquarium heater?
2016-02-17 17:00:04	inode33	no, you need battery life for that.
2016-02-17 17:00:25	redcheckers	not if you create a +voltage in the tank

2016-02-17 19:19:49	FrostFeline	Though there's no real restriction that the CCID be plugged into that computer, just that it be accessible by that computer.
2016-02-17 19:20:08	FrostFeline	You gpg encrypt a key file and have the ccid card perform the decryption.

2016-02-17 19:39:38	+Tear	wow seriously
2016-02-17 19:39:39	tomboy65	gentwo: two ways to deal with that
2016-02-17 19:40:23	tomboy65	ABI_X86_32="*" into your make.conf - which will cause a recompile of ~1000 packages in your system
2016-02-17 19:41:09	+Chainsaw	Or try and be specific, spend 1000 minutes doing that, give up and go back to option 1.
2016-02-17 19:41:17	tomboy65	make a file in /etc/portage/package.use/ where you list all those extra abi_x86_32 use-flags for the packages
2016-02-17 19:41:45	tomboy65	i did the latter
2016-02-17 19:45:26	gentwo	tomboy65: ABI_X86_32="*" when adding that, it mix 64 bit and 32 bit,

2016-02-17 20:33:04	tomboy65	gentwo: not wanting to scold you, but i think a big issue is that a) you want to take on a lot of things at once and b) once you're at troubleshooting, you seem to always have something differently on your platter so you can't really focus on it

2016-02-17 20:39:24	tomboy65	for the use-flags you enabled, try to compartmentalize changes you make for installing a specific piece of software. e.g. next time you install something like nvidia-drivers, make specific use-flag changes to /etc/portage/package.use/nvidia-drivers, specific ~ changes to /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/nvidia-drivers. this way reverting those changes is but a file-delete away.

2016-02-17 20:47:29	tomboy65	gentwo: not a big deal on modern day computers.
2016-02-17 20:47:50	+eroen	usually if a package has both library and executables, only native abi executables are installed as they are overwrite the non-native executables during build ;)
2016-02-17 20:47:54	+Cheaterman	twice the build time isn't a big deal nowadays indeed
2016-02-17 20:47:56	+Cheaterman	except webkit haha

2016-02-18 11:47:47	jwm224	too
2016-02-18 11:47:48	+zlg	Define "Dark Web"?
2016-02-18 11:48:15	jwm224	The whole onion get up... I'm guessing.
2016-02-18 11:48:27	+zlg	I've visited sites you can only find on I2P, Tor, and/or gopher.
2016-02-18 11:48:59	+zlg	Though gopher's more 'deep web' than 'dark web' since nothing aside from Veronica itself indexes gopherspace
2016-02-18 11:49:08	jwm224	My friend is looking to get a program for unlocking phones. He said he had to go to the dark web. I never toyed with it.
2016-02-18 11:49:38	+zlg	pfft, phone unlocking has tons of resources out there
2016-02-18 11:49:43	+zlg	xda-developers is like, the first stop.
2016-02-18 11:50:45	jwm224	Good to note. I'll look into gopher's... It sounds safer. lol
2016-02-18 11:50:58	+zlg	Well, gopherspace won't really have much on phones, tbh.
2016-02-18 11:51:12	+zlg	It's what some would call 'hipster', since it's the precursor to the WWW/HTTP.

2016-02-18 12:09:25	kuzetsa	I wasn't aware gnupg interracts with smartcards for anything

2016-02-18 12:09:28	kuzetsa	what's that do?
2016-02-18 12:09:43	+zlg	A smartcard, iiuc, can be used to store the private key itself
2016-02-18 12:10:04	+zlg	so you don't have to count on the safety of your hard drive, for example, to ensure the private key is secure.
2016-02-18 12:10:08	kuzetsa	hmm
2016-02-18 12:10:10	+zlg	If it's on your person, it's (mostly) secure.
2016-02-18 12:10:16	+zlg	That's how I understand it, anyway.
2016-02-18 12:10:27	kuzetsa	looks like I get to report a bug
2016-02-18 12:10:33	+zlg	What bug?
2016-02-18 12:10:35	kuzetsa	after reemerging gnupg with -usb use flag
2016-02-18 12:10:49	kuzetsa	equery depends libusb still shows gnupg needs libusb
2016-02-18 12:11:10	+zlg	that's likely because libusb is still installed.
2016-02-18 12:11:14	+zlg	Have you depcleaned?
2016-02-18 12:11:27	+zlg	`emerge -vac`
2016-02-18 12:11:38	FrostFeline	speaking of smartcards.
2016-02-18 12:11:46	FrostFeline	Mine died recently... :(
2016-02-18 12:11:50	+zlg	that sucks
2016-02-18 12:12:00	FrostFeline	luckily yubico offers a 2 year RMA period.
2016-02-18 12:12:01	+zlg	I've considered getting one but I don't know enough about the tech nor do I have the monies.
2016-02-18 12:12:07	+zlg	wow, 2 years?
2016-02-18 12:12:10	+zlg	That's awesome
2016-02-18 12:12:26	FrostFeline	I imagine it cost them more to print the plastic case then the card itself
2016-02-18 12:12:38	FrostFeline	It costs 50 bucks for a yubikey and it's a USB CCID device.
2016-02-18 12:13:02	+zlg	Do you need a special reader for it?
2016-02-18 12:13:04	FrostFeline	About the size of a ... key
2016-02-18 12:13:09	FrostFeline	no
2016-02-18 12:13:33	FrostFeline	USB CCID readers are cheap though.
2016-02-18 12:13:40	dia	https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/userrel/soc/applying.xml ... 404 :(
2016-02-18 12:13:42	+zlg	I guess the setup I'm thinking of is milsec
2016-02-18 12:13:43	FrostFeline	You can get keyboards that have them built in.
2016-02-18 12:14:05	FrostFeline	Can't imagine what' special about that :P
2016-02-18 12:14:11	FrostFeline	More keys per card?
2016-02-18 12:14:43	+zlg	FrostFeline: I just recall soldiers using their card on their laptop. The card physically slid into the laptop iirc
2016-02-18 12:14:46	kuzetsa	zlg: good point I haven't run depclean in a while >>> All selected packages: =dev-libs/libnl-3.2.27 =virtual/libusb-1-r2 =virtual/libudev-215-r1 =net-wireless/iw-3.17 =dev-libs/libusb-1.0.19 =sys-apps/pciutils-3.3.1 =sys-apps/ethtool-3.18 =net-wireless/wireless-tools-30_pre9 =dev-db/sqlite-3.9.2

2016-02-18 12:15:14	+zlg	FrostFeline: maybe pcmcia readers.
2016-02-18 12:16:04	FrostFeline	The smartcard readers with pinpads cost a bit more to a ton more

2016-02-18 12:16:34	kuzetsa	huh, so is it normal for equery depends to say: app-crypt/gnupg-2.0.28 (usb ? virtual/libusb:0)
2016-02-18 12:16:34	kuzetsa	 even with -usb use flag and libusb not even installed?
2016-02-18 12:16:59	+zlg	kuzetsa: Whats your exact command?
2016-02-18 12:17:03	FrostFeline	zlg: Of course, naked smartcards aren't that expensive and probably a better choice if you need to handle a ton of smartcards
2016-02-18 12:17:04	kuzetsa	'cause if that's normal I guess it's not a bug it's just confusing

2016-02-18 12:17:27	FrostFeline	but for a personal one, the yubikey is pretty nice.
2016-02-18 12:17:31	+zlg	Hm
2016-02-18 12:17:43	kuzetsa	it's no longer installed, and no longer in the emerge @world --update --complete-graph --deep --jobs 1 --load-average 1 --newuse --with-bdeps y --verbose --pretend
2016-02-18 12:17:53	kuzetsa	but it still shows up under equery depends I guess
2016-02-18 12:18:05	+zlg	I'm trying to think of a case here to easily reproduce..
2016-02-18 12:18:14	FrostFeline	Only disadvantage of the yubikey and other smartcard readers without a dedicated pinpad is you're exposing your PIN to your OS.
2016-02-18 12:18:22	+zlg	At any rate, I believe all it'll show is cases where something *may* require it
2016-02-18 12:18:31	+zlg	Thus the 'usb?' part
2016-02-18 12:19:00	+zlg	FrostFeline: They don't use passphrases like pinentry?
2016-02-18 12:19:11	FrostFeline	They do use pinentry
2016-02-18 12:19:12	kuzetsa	(usb ? virtual/libusb:0) <<< that's totally ebuild syntax, and states that it's a schrodinger dependancy (the package needs it, but also doesn't)
2016-02-18 12:19:15	+zlg	ah
2016-02-18 12:19:21	FrostFeline	Hence the "exposed pin to the OS"
2016-02-18 12:19:27	+zlg	ah
2016-02-18 12:19:31	FrostFeline	As opposed to one with a dedicated keypad
2016-02-18 12:19:37	kuzetsa	the usb use flag being -usb means in my case it's not a dependancy
2016-02-18 12:19:56	+zlg	kuzetsa: It's not a schroedinger dep. It's saying "if usb is enabled, depend on this package"
2016-02-18 12:19:59	kuzetsa	but I guess equery wanted to let me know it CAN be a dep lol
2016-02-18 12:20:09	kuzetsa	sure it is
2016-02-18 12:20:11	+zlg	Since it's not enabled anymore, it's no longer a dependency
2016-02-18 12:20:16	kuzetsa	schrodinger's cat is a superposition of a dead and living cat
2016-02-18 12:20:39	kuzetsa	and schrodinger's dependancy would be a superposition of a dependancy and one which isn't a dependancy
2016-02-18 12:20:54	kuzetsa	I grammared that weirdly but ok
2016-02-18 12:21:41	kuzetsa	schrodinger like ... 'cause the superposition state collapses reality into one state or the other as soon as you observe the actual situation (the usb flag in this case)
2016-02-18 12:22:15	+zlg	kuzetsa: Honestly I think there's a cache somewhere that might be the cause of showing that, but I don't know enough about equery to say for certain.
2016-02-18 12:22:23	kuzetsa	nod
2016-02-18 12:22:43	kuzetsa	so long as portage isn't trying to pull in libusb anymore I don't really care

2016-02-18 12:33:16	kuzetsa	CVE-2013-4312 is still "undergoing analysis and not all information is available" (according to web.nvd.nist.gov)
2016-02-18 12:33:49	kuzetsa	... CVE from 2013 listed as still being "nder analysis"sounds kinda sketchy, but ok
2016-02-18 12:34:19	kuzetsa	same for CVE-2016-0728 (under analysis)
2016-02-18 12:34:28	dia	kuzetsa, paranoid? haha
2016-02-18 12:34:33	dugz	i just updated and tested out my rescue puppy linux system that lives in /boot. looks good
2016-02-18 12:34:44	kuzetsa	CVE-2015-7550 too, huh... 3 out of the 5
2016-02-18 12:35:32	kuzetsa	CVE-2015-6937 is the only one I'm actually worried about TBH
2016-02-18 12:36:45	dugz	aww drat, my puppy linux rescue system is vulnerable
2016-02-18 12:37:24	kuzetsa	dugz: which CVE(s) ?
2016-02-18 12:37:29	kuzetsa	all of them? lol
2016-02-18 12:37:39	dugz	probably all of them
2016-02-18 12:38:11	kuzetsa	nod
2016-02-18 12:38:33	kuzetsa	puppylinux is one of my favorite liveusb distros
2016-02-18 12:39:22	kuzetsa	completely lovely compared to most "runs from ram" distros, and the optional persistence functionality is pretty cool
2016-02-18 12:39:24	dugz	i use the fatdog64 version because it supports my hardware better
2016-02-18 12:40:05	kuzetsa	of course, by "completely lovely" I mean boot speed and system requirements being ideal for running on totally random ancient hardware
2016-02-18 12:40:17	dugz	kuzetsa, well to "install" it, i just copy the kernel and initrd for it into /boot and make a menu entry for it
2016-02-18 12:41:05	dugz	then i let it make a small savefile, set its monitors up, and done
2016-02-18 12:41:50	kuzetsa	or in the case of not having /boot (like on a windows system) you do a similar steps involving the bcdedit (windows tool) for editing the boot menu, and you need grub4win / grub4dos / syslinux or some other bootloader which works sanely on your  filesystem
2016-02-18 12:41:55	dugz	works well in extreme type situations
2016-02-18 12:42:29	kuzetsa	I had a windows bootloader ---> linux bootloader ---> puppylinux for the longest time
2016-02-18 12:42:34	dugz	i have SYSLINUX™ here :D
2016-02-18 12:42:41	kuzetsa	1.3ghz laptop
2016-02-18 12:43:04	kuzetsa	I mean, can you remember the last time a 1.3ghz laptop was actually a good one?
2016-02-18 12:43:04		[12:43]
2016-02-18 12:43:40	kuzetsa	this laptop so fast wew lad
2016-02-18 12:44:45	dugz	mine is a 1.6GHz Pentium4m with *real* radeon mobility :)
2016-02-18 12:45:49	dugz	it also lacks a working battery these days
2016-02-18 12:47:19	kuzetsa	huh
2016-02-18 12:47:47	kuzetsa	I wasn't aware AMD had 1.6ghz chips back in 2001
2016-02-18 12:47:57	kuzetsa	...
2016-02-18 12:48:01	kuzetsa	pentium is intel
2016-02-18 12:48:55	dugz	oh did i crash the amd laptop pow-wow? well carry on
2016-02-18 12:49:19	kuzetsa	IDK
2016-02-18 12:49:36	kuzetsa	I think I had an athlon of some kind around 2001
2016-02-18 12:49:47	kuzetsa	but it was so long ago I honestly can't remember what the clock speed was
2016-02-18 12:50:58	dugz	i had a dual pentium-ii server board that fried and i bought an athlon-xp 2400+ which was pretty decent
2016-02-18 12:51:51	dugz	i used that until i built a phenom

2016-02-18 14:58:02	dia	os x is nice.
2016-02-18 14:58:31	FrostFeline	It's got X11 support and various ports like systems that you can drop-in and go for it.
2016-02-18 14:58:41	FrostFeline	So you can use most of your familiar Linux software.
2016-02-18 14:58:59	FrostFeline	And it's a free X server, unlike on Windows :P

2016-02-18 15:06:15	puddlejumper	dugz: i believe the 'v' in tv is vision :p
2016-02-18 15:07:41	dugz	i had a tv card that never worked right but its supported in the kernel now so i have antenna hdtv now :)
2016-02-18 15:10:06	puddlejumper	dugz: does that work with `mpv tv://` :p
2016-02-18 15:10:30	dugz	puddlejumper, i believe it does. dvb://
2016-02-18 15:11:14	dugz	it works with VLC in a clunky way but Me-TV is the best lightweight app
2016-02-18 15:11:49	dugz	i'm pretty sure it would be supported by mythtv, etc
2016-02-18 15:12:25	puddlejumper	i'd use mpv
2016-02-18 15:12:30	puddlejumper	it works for most things
2016-02-18 15:12:52	dugz	you have to setup your channel scan for these things to work

2016-02-18 17:36:35	froller	there isn't much support oing on in weekday mornings so i always forget i'm at a tech support chan and not the pub =)
2016-02-18 17:36:52	_ohm	gotcha, it's still evening here
2016-02-18 17:37:23	_ohm	so people said gentoo is hard to install(false), now they say it's hard to maintain, is this true or no?
2016-02-18 17:37:43	_ohm	portage seems pretty straight forward and i haven't had anything break, but then again it's only been 3 days
2016-02-18 17:38:15	froller	i'm ny experience, somethings going to break for you eventually, and it's not going to be a problem =)

2016-02-18 17:38:51	froller	if you didn't have trouble installing, you won't have trouble maintaining
2016-02-18 17:39:02	froller	google and the irc channel
2016-02-18 17:39:15	_ohm	that's good, the only pain was the loooooooong compile times
2016-02-18 17:39:30	froller	i've gotten used to it too
2016-02-18 17:39:41	froller	last night before i went to bed i put emerge -uv world running
2016-02-18 17:39:54	_ohm	no deep?
2016-02-18 17:40:01	froller	it had only compiled firefox-44 in the morning, but i put the emerge to sleep so i can use the computer during the day
2016-02-18 17:40:16	froller	i usually do without deep first and the the deep version
2016-02-18 17:40:29	_ohm	makes sense
2016-02-18 17:41:21	froller	one thing to do is to remember to sync every few days at least and update your stuff
2016-02-18 17:41:51	_ohm	wonder if i can just set a cron job for that
2016-02-18 17:41:54	froller	i'm lazy and have bad memory, so a few times i've had to update a months old system and while it has always worked out it hasn't always been very pretty =)
2016-02-18 17:42:14	froller	don't set the cron to sync more than once a day
2016-02-18 17:42:33	froller	and think about it... you might not want cron to be the one to start the updates for you
2016-02-18 17:42:48	_ohm	maybe i'll have it remind me or somethign
2016-02-18 17:42:58	froller	like my previous case of starting the update when i go to bed, no at 8 pm every day =)
2016-02-18 17:44:29	_ohm	from the way i see it
2016-02-18 17:44:42	_ohm	gentoo = vanilla linux + portage
2016-02-18 17:44:45	_ohm	anything else?
2016-02-18 17:47:20	_ohm	ubuntu = vanilla linux + apt + gnome + do as many thing as possible for the user as default

2016-02-18 17:53:22	froller	yeah, they call gentoo a "meta distribution"
2016-02-18 17:53:32	froller	gentoo doesn't have to be linux either =)
2016-02-18 17:53:58	_ohm	?
2016-02-18 17:54:09	_ohm	gentoo = linux + portage
2016-02-18 17:54:33	_ohm	i saw a project where portage was ported to bsd, but is bsd + portage = gentoo?
2016-02-18 17:54:52	froller	isn't that gentoo-bsd =)
2016-02-18 17:55:17	_ohm	interesting
2016-02-18 17:55:19	froller	also, both ubuntu and gentoo patch their kernels
2016-02-18 17:55:25	puddlejumper	i don't think gentoo-bsd is still being developed
2016-02-18 17:55:32	froller	(of course you can have your kernel unpatched on gentoo)
2016-02-18 17:55:41	froller	and i for one use ck-sources
2016-02-18 17:56:11	froller	i'm not sure if it is the case any more these days, but back when i first discovered it, it had major impact on desktop responsiveness for me
2016-02-18 17:56:50	puddlejumper	it's a lot easier to maintain your own kernel on gentoo
2016-02-18 17:57:10	puddlejumper	there's even vanilla flag for gentoo-sources
2016-02-18 17:57:29	froller	and experimental for the wild ones

2016-02-18 17:59:13	froller	that truly is the question...

2016-02-18 18:12:10	FrostFeline	Is there much reason to upgrade your kernel on a single user machine (for local kernel exploits)(i.e. not a server). Anything that owns your software is going to have access to all your data unless you have special precautions in place.
2016-02-18 18:12:28	FrostFeline	graphics drivers are plenty crashy without 1337 hackers molesting them.

2016-02-18 19:23:08	dugz	puddlejumper, this was a system-wide edit to anything that calls the pc-spkr module for a beep

2016-02-18 19:23:49	puddlejumper	used to even use it for irssi on highlight

2016-02-18 20:41:48	Tear	i'm not swimming in space so duplicity is nice because its backups are incremental, it only stores the difference between previous and current backups
2016-02-18 20:43:03	Tear	but i don't know what happens when it runs out of space, there doesn't seem to be any way to specify max available space and some backends it supports don't have a way of reporting it
2016-02-18 20:43:16	puddlejumper	did some anthropologist find an acient system with ftp?
2016-02-18 20:43:23	puddlejumper	ancient rather

2016-02-18 20:43:52	+xiaomiao	it's the only way to move larger amounts of data between customers of 'variable technical experience"

2016-02-18 20:43:56	+xiaomiao	if you know what I mean
2016-02-18 20:43:57	puddlejumper	xiaomiao: do people still use it for uploading things to a website?
2016-02-18 20:44:19	puddlejumper	i just use ssh :/
2016-02-18 20:44:21	+xiaomiao	puddlejumper: in this case it's project assets (think documents, pdfs, etc.)
2016-02-18 20:44:47	dugz	ftp is uncommon for general web surfing now
2016-02-18 20:44:50	+xiaomiao	there's a http(s) frontend to interact with ftp, there's ftp(s) for those with a good ftp browser
2016-02-18 20:44:58	+xiaomiao	it makes sense for this specific setup
2016-02-18 20:45:15	+xiaomiao	the web 'filemanagers' the customers use are horrible and can't be automated
2016-02-18 20:45:26	+xiaomiao	thus fetching a 1GB file is suddenly a horribly difficult task

2016-02-18 21:08:28	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: You are accelerating, decelerating or coasting. You should not be trying to combine any of those things.

2016-02-18 21:14:02	dugz	generally you never want to be on the brake and gas at the same time, hence only use right foot for gas or brake
2016-02-18 21:14:31	+wiktor_b	dugz: of course, but it's easier to lift a foot than it is to lift AND move it left/right
2016-02-18 21:14:38	+wiktor_b	s/easier/quicker/
2016-02-18 21:14:54	+wiktor_b	granted, I only left-foot brake when I go into a tight corner too fast
2016-02-18 21:14:58	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: You actually place the ball of your foot on the floor so that you can rotate it.
2016-02-18 21:15:24	+wiktor_b	hmm
2016-02-18 21:15:26	+wiktor_b	ok :)
2016-02-18 21:15:32	+wiktor_b	just wanted to know
2016-02-18 21:15:40	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: I do, anyway. There isn't a lot of clearance for my foot.
2016-02-18 21:16:47	+Chainsaw	dugz: Indeed, I can't think of any situation where I would want to blend accelerating, coasting or decelerating together.
2016-02-18 21:17:27	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: it's not about being able to push both throttle and brake at the same time, it's about being able to very quickly switch between the two
2016-02-18 21:17:31	dugz	aside from stupid things like powerbrake burnouts
2016-02-18 21:17:53	+Chainsaw	dugz: I like my tires.
2016-02-18 21:18:19	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: You can & do switch quickly in your manual car, do you not?
2016-02-18 21:19:28	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: yes, but I can accelerate after braking noticably more quickly if I use my left foot for the brake
2016-02-18 21:20:01	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: but I only use it for tight corners when I didn't slow down enough or I'm turning onto a steep hill
2016-02-18 21:20:04	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: We must have a very different style of driving.
2016-02-18 21:20:25	+xiaomiao	wiktor_b: the clutchbrake foot position that rallye drivers sometimes use?
2016-02-18 21:20:27	dugz	i feel like i am driving a motorboat when i get in my auto honda civic. you step on the gas and its slushbox starts chugging
2016-02-18 21:20:38	+xiaomiao	similar to the throttlebrake position used to keep the engine at high rpms
2016-02-18 21:20:55	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: no, though I was wanting to try it out
2016-02-18 21:21:08	+Chainsaw	dugz: My 300C is pretty quick off the mark on the kickdown.

2016-02-18 21:22:00	+wiktor_b	what I do is reduce to 2nd then hit the brake with left foot slightly, then push throttle at the same rate as letting go of brakes
2016-02-18 21:22:11	dugz	my other beater is a ford focus zx3 with a stick shift, its not fast but it feels zippy
2016-02-18 21:22:12	mvaenskae	wheeee, my backup script seems to be working at least one way \o/
2016-02-18 21:22:42	mvaenskae	ugly but alas, i want to start redoing my phone in a few
2016-02-18 21:22:45	+wiktor_b	I try avoid doing it because it means I went into a corner too fast and I want to avoid picking up the bad habit
2016-02-18 21:23:02	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: I passed my test in a manual and I can drive that way, but it sure seems a lot of work.
2016-02-18 21:23:03	+wiktor_b	but it's very useful when turning into a steep hill
2016-02-18 21:24:05	+xiaomiao	Chainsaw: if you drive more it becomes automatic behaviour
2016-02-18 21:24:05		[21:24]
2016-02-18 21:24:15	+xiaomiao	Chainsaw: as much effort as riding a bicycle ;)
2016-02-18 21:24:15	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: as I said, emergency situations and steep hills only

2016-02-18 21:26:07	+xiaomiao	Chainsaw: ah, nice
2016-02-18 21:26:08	gentwo	is this for hdmi audio or just audio out from just system?
2016-02-18 21:26:13	+xiaomiao	Chainsaw: I haven't had the need for a car yet
2016-02-18 21:26:16	+Chainsaw	gentwo: It's generally 2048 for PulseAudio systems is it not?
2016-02-18 21:26:24	dugz	my honda is a lot easier to drive, although the stick shift focus is more fun on a nice day
2016-02-18 21:26:28	+Chainsaw	gentwo: Kernel help should have that suggestion for you.
2016-02-18 21:26:34	gentwo	Chainsaw: i am not using pulse. alsa
2016-02-18 21:26:35	+wiktor_b	I've been in a few automatics and I've never seen one that wasn't super-sluggish at start, especially hill start

2016-02-18 21:27:07	+wiktor_b	gentwo: keep it low for low latency, keep it high if you experience crackling from buffer underruns
2016-02-18 21:27:16	dugz	gentwo, the kernel has Help for every option, things like that are probably set at reasonable defaults
2016-02-18 21:27:32	+Chainsaw	wiktor_b: I'll give you a lift in mine. You've been in sluggish cars with small petrol engines, haven't you.
2016-02-18 21:27:38	+wiktor_b	gentwo: large buffer = less chance of buffer underrun, higher latency; small buffer = higher chance of buffer underrun, lower latency
2016-02-18 21:27:51	gentwo	but my question is it related to hdmi output or just normal audio out?
2016-02-18 21:27:58	+Chainsaw	gentwo: All audio output.
2016-02-18 21:28:03	gentwo	ok
2016-02-18 21:28:05	+wiktor_b	Chainsaw: even the fancier onces like lexus and maserati are still sluggish
2016-02-18 21:28:10	+Chainsaw	gentwo: Generally both your HDMI audio & main soundcard are HD-Audio.

2016-02-18 21:31:02	gentwo	ok, done the changes, kernel compile started. will let you know the resutls
2016-02-18 21:31:06	dugz	gentwo, from the kernel <Help> A larger buffer (e.g. 2048) is preferred for systems using PulseAudio. The default 64 is chosen just for compatibility reasons.
2016-02-18 21:31:19	+wiktor_b	you just hear rpm going down every so often

2016-02-18 21:32:11	dugz	wiktor_b, mine is just left at 64, although I have disabled HD Audio

2016-02-18 22:14:13	FrostFeline	I guess it wouldn't be so cheap with a 128GB SSD though
2016-02-18 22:14:13	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: the clutch-brake maneouver is awesome for high speed turns but it's bad for the drive train, not really feasible for street use :)
2016-02-18 22:14:34	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: and especially not in a car that'l be officially classified as an antique soon, heh
2016-02-18 22:14:51	+xiaomiao	wiktor_b: that's why I recommend everyone should learn driving in an original VW Beetle
2016-02-18 22:14:56	+xiaomiao	teaches respect :)
2016-02-18 22:15:11	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: I have a 256 GB PCIe one, freakin fast as hell
2016-02-18 22:16:35	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: I thought something similar a while ago
2016-02-18 22:17:00	+xiaomiao	wiktor_b: we could go with a Mexico model with the upgraded 1600cc / ~45hp engine
2016-02-18 22:17:13	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: maybe not necessarily a beetle but soon after you pass your test, or even before, you should drive an old car without fancy features for a while
2016-02-18 22:17:17	+xiaomiao	direct brakes :) at highway speeds it takes lots of strength to motivate the car
2016-02-18 22:17:32	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: one that clunks and you can hear every rpm change
2016-02-18 22:17:43	FrostFeline	It would be nice if they make a chromebook that will accept 2.5 inch drives.

2016-02-18 22:17:53	FrostFeline	Imagine the data density
2016-02-18 22:18:10	FrostFeline	Linustechtips recently reviewed a 4TB 2.5 inch SSD
2016-02-18 22:18:29	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: the bus isn't really friendly with that form factor, tho
2016-02-18 22:18:58	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: power steering and power brakes are acceptable IMHO, ABS is really pushing it
2016-02-18 22:19:04	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: manual transmission, tho
2016-02-18 22:19:04	FrostFeline	There's no reason there can't be an M.2 ssd with a 2.5 inch drive shape.
2016-02-18 22:19:15	FrostFeline	Use a short riser cable if you need to do something tricky
2016-02-18 22:19:23	+xiaomiao	wiktor_b: I'd say initially you should learn 'barebones'
2016-02-18 22:19:33	+xiaomiao	wiktor_b: all this fancy stuff makes people lazy
2016-02-18 22:19:47	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: well, the mini PCIe edge connector is quite smaller than a 2.5" drive
2016-02-18 22:20:03	+wiktor_b	xiaomiao: I wouldn't consider power steering and power brakes "fancy stuff" :)

2016-02-19 00:19:31	CcxCZ	nebg: Zsh has the best vi mode I've seen so far in any non-editor application. You need to get a few scripts to get mode indication and text objects to work. The input mode is fully scriptable so you could extend even further - though I usually just use the keybinding to drop the current line into full blown vim at that point.

2016-02-19 01:53:44	+wiktor_b	then you need more and more
2016-02-19 01:54:06	hosler	after the first few times it happens it becomes the norm. then when your next kernel fails you feel dumb.
2016-02-19 01:54:06		[01:54]
2016-02-19 01:54:10	+wiktor_b	then you need your kernel to fit on a floppy to get any dopamine response whatsoever

2016-02-19 03:05:44		[03:05]
2016-02-19 03:05:46	+chithead	rowhammer is the problem that writing to memory will affect adjacent rows, which can induce bit flips
2016-02-19 03:05:48	AsumFace	flip bits you don't have access to in ram by accessing adjacent bits
2016-02-19 03:06:21	+chithead	exploiting rowhammer through javascript has been demonstrated
2016-02-19 03:06:53	FrostFeline	You can fix it if you're willing to refresh your ram a little more but that uses power
2016-02-19 03:07:06	FrostFeline	Well, "fix" more like workaround

2016-02-19 03:14:14	FrostFeline	:^)
2016-02-19 03:14:29	+iamben	i have 2 mice atm, haven't figured out how to effectively use both at once
2016-02-19 03:14:34	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: where's the other 200 or so Mbps?
2016-02-19 03:14:52	+wiktor_b	iamben: you've reached the next level of gui
2016-02-19 03:15:02	+wiktor_b	iamben: I bet you don't even use a keyboard anymore
2016-02-19 03:15:08	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Well some of it is going to be lost in overhead
2016-02-19 03:15:27	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: aaaand it's a 10 dollar nic from tp-link
2016-02-19 03:15:36	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: hmm... nice
2016-02-19 03:15:37	+iamben	wiktor_b: actually i wish my desktop (non-notebook) had a nipple mouse so i didn't have to leave the keyboard to do mousing, but alas
2016-02-19 03:15:42	FrostFeline	tp-link does make good commodity hardware.
2016-02-19 03:15:55	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: 80% efficiency from a super cheapo gige nic? I call it a win
2016-02-19 03:15:59	FrostFeline	iamben: do some hackery and install one?
2016-02-19 03:16:00	+doc235	iamben, where you able to locate a PSU?
2016-02-19 03:16:11	+wiktor_b	iamben: lol you're not even using vi keys to navigate windows?
2016-02-19 03:16:41	+doc235	dum de dum deeeeee deee edum
2016-02-19 03:16:53	Smiley	hmmm
2016-02-19 03:17:05	Smiley	I want gige once I move
2016-02-19 03:17:10	+iamben	doc235: yeah i just gotta box 'em up
2016-02-19 03:17:10	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: https://kb.netapp.com/index?page=content&id=3011938&actp=LIST_POPULAR
2016-02-19 03:17:15	Smiley	might be on power line for awhile tho until I figure out where we can run ethernet
2016-02-19 03:17:26	+doc235	thanks again my friend. i will pay it forward
2016-02-19 03:17:40	+iamben	Smiley: i spent the whole weekend in the crawlspace and attic, finally getting some ethernets here
2016-02-19 03:17:48	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: wow you were right on the money
2016-02-19 03:17:54	FrostFeline	82.5% efficiency
2016-02-19 03:17:57	+iamben	and will have a fancy ceiling-mount AP
2016-02-19 03:18:00	+doc235	you wire your house iamben?
2016-02-19 03:18:06	+iamben	doc235: im not totally done, but yeah
2016-02-19 03:18:11	+doc235	cool
2016-02-19 03:18:16	+doc235	i wired my house
2016-02-19 03:18:28	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: yeah you didn't exactly say what are you measuring
2016-02-19 03:18:35	+doc235	i was renting and the owner ripped it out qwhen i left :/ did not know what it was
2016-02-19 03:18:52	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: It was iperf3
2016-02-19 03:19:00	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: I was measuring the CPU overhead
2016-02-19 03:19:04	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: actual file data from a http connection excluding all protocol overhead, raw ethernet frames, ...
2016-02-19 03:19:07	FrostFeline	it was pretty horrible a few months ago.
2016-02-19 03:19:32	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Ah, well iperf uses tcp, so there is that.
2016-02-19 03:19:43	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: ok, so not bad then
2016-02-19 03:19:49	+iamben	FrostFeline: i did some iperf3 tests yesterday and got ~930-940mbits, fwiw
2016-02-19 03:19:53	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: but in practice there's always going to be things at the application layer, poorly coded libs etc
2016-02-19 03:19:55	+wiktor_b	I'm so putting rj45 drops in my new house
2016-02-19 03:20:30	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: yeah, it's still not bad, tbh, especially if you can sustain >800 Mbps over, let's say, a minute
2016-02-19 03:20:34	+iamben	overhead-wise, pretty much lines up with the 93-94mbits i see on my 100mbit lan
2016-02-19 03:20:42	Smiley	iamben: yeah UK houses don't have a crawl space
2016-02-19 03:20:48	Smiley	and I'll be based in the extension
2016-02-19 03:20:48		[03:20]
2016-02-19 03:20:48	FrostFeline	Yeah I definitely got 800mbps sustained.
2016-02-19 03:21:04	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: You can do some cheap hackery with an intel 4port gigabit nic
2016-02-19 03:21:14	Smiley	which is coming off the kitchen, however the old chimney has been converted, in the middle of the house, into a kinda rack space with with the CCTV equipment there
2016-02-19 03:21:17	FrostFeline	and do nic teaming to get >1Gbps for under 100 dollars.
2016-02-19 03:21:23	+iamben	doc235: you still want a PSU for that dell, and one for the amd/athlon setup, right?
2016-02-19 03:21:23	+wiktor_b	Smiley: I'll just dig holes in walls and underneath floors
2016-02-19 03:21:36	+wiktor_b	Smiley: I want proper rj45 drops in every room and I'll get them dammit
2016-02-19 03:21:43	Smiley	wiktor_b: yeah cept the house is like precitine :P
2016-02-19 03:21:48	Smiley	so i gotta do this all nicely
2016-02-19 03:21:53	+doc235	yes iamben, please
2016-02-19 03:22:00	Smiley	First step is getting IN the house.
2016-02-19 03:22:05	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: congrats, which nic is it exactly?
2016-02-19 03:22:32	+wiktor_b	Smiley: for me the first step is finding out which city to buy the flat in
2016-02-19 03:23:15	Smiley	Come join me in coventry
2016-02-19 03:23:17	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: http://amzn.com/B003CFATNI this one
2016-02-19 03:23:21	Smiley	lots of students and more coming
2016-02-19 03:23:22	+wiktor_b	Smiley: scotland for now
2016-02-19 03:23:28	Smiley	student accom going up everywhere
2016-02-19 03:23:50	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: The one in this motherboard got fried by lightning (I think) and won't negotiate gigabit, or recognize when you unplug the ethernet
2016-02-19 03:24:11	mvaenskae	Smiley: at least my backup script for my data has become a single liner
2016-02-19 03:24:22	FrostFeline	I also had an old router with a burnt out ethernet port that I recieved (supports my theory)
2016-02-19 03:24:24	parazyd	what's your average package count on your daily machines?
2016-02-19 03:24:35	parazyd	just wondering what other people do
2016-02-19 03:25:04	FrostFeline	Actually I just got a solid 977Mbps peaking to 985
2016-02-19 03:25:05	Smiley	mvaenskae: cp *
2016-02-19 03:25:06	Smiley	:DF
2016-02-19 03:25:08	FrostFeline	Hue hue
2016-02-19 03:25:17	mvaenskae	Smiley: uses ssh
2016-02-19 03:25:23	 < 	potatoe (~nonex8@nusnet-180-103.dynip.nus.edu.sg) has quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2016-02-19 03:25:34	Smiley	ssh... -c cp
2016-02-19 03:25:35	+iamben	parazyd: ~1100 on desktops, ~350 on servers
2016-02-19 03:25:40	Smiley	XD
2016-02-19 03:26:07	mvaenskae	Smiley: i am not touching mtp, that's right next to printers a hellish design
2016-02-19 03:26:11	parazyd	that's neat :)
2016-02-19 03:26:15	FrostFeline	hm....
2016-02-19 03:26:26	FrostFeline	not getting the full 450Mbps on my chromebooks N wifi
2016-02-19 03:26:46	FrostFeline	(did you know atheros chips come with spectrum analyzers? how cool is that!?)
2016-02-19 03:27:09	FrostFeline	(so you can find that obnoxious microwave)
2016-02-19 03:27:18	mvaenskae	Smiley: i can now use ./scriptname --in/--out --add/--new --checksum --list android:/sdcard/
2016-02-19 03:27:22	+iamben	FrostFeline: on wifi you'll get a much much smaller portion of the theoretical max
2016-02-19 03:27:28	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: hmm, lighting damage is bad :)
2016-02-19 03:27:37	mvaenskae	Smiley: all that i so far need for backups but i will extend the script i think
2016-02-19 03:27:48	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Well I'm not using it anymore :D
2016-02-19 03:27:48	+wiktor_b	parazyd: similar to iamben for me, except more like 600-800 on desktops
2016-02-19 03:28:09	parazyd	i'm also around 800 on desktop
2016-02-19 03:28:19	FrostFeline	I should be getting more than 200mbps though, right?
2016-02-19 03:28:21	+iamben	wiktor_b uses a smaller lighter desktop setup because the rest wont run on musl
2016-02-19 03:28:22	+wiktor_b	parazyd: though my workstation at work is >1200 because of a bajillion toolchains and that
2016-02-19 03:28:30	parazyd	still not patient enough to migrate servers to gentoo :D
2016-02-19 03:28:36	FrostFeline	iamben: I've got clean air here(I'm the only one with radar detection enabled)
2016-02-19 03:28:47	+wiktor_b	hmm
2016-02-19 03:28:48	+wiktor_b	1067
2016-02-19 03:28:55	+wiktor_b	I must've cleaned up, hehe
2016-02-19 03:29:07	+iamben	FrostFeline: still, dont expect 90%+ like on wired.  is this iwlwifi?
2016-02-19 03:29:11	+wiktor_b	swear it was >1200
2016-02-19 03:29:39	parazyd	lol
2016-02-19 03:29:40	FrostFeline	iamben: Yes, it's an intel nic
2016-02-19 03:29:55	FrostFeline	iamben: Sorry, not intel
2016-02-19 03:29:59	FrostFeline	ath9k
2016-02-19 03:30:41	+wiktor_b	iamben: my anti fud is that xfce4 and plasma5 both work on musl
2016-02-19 03:31:06	AwoL	going from Postgres 9.4 to 9.5 would be considered a migration, no?
2016-02-19 03:31:24	AwoL	the pg_upgrade step needs to be performed?
2016-02-19 03:32:30	+iamben	wiktor_b: im moving back to gnome3 soon, won't work here
2016-02-19 03:32:41	+wiktor_b	iamben: and not even planning to!
2016-02-19 03:32:42	+doc235	help. what does fud stand for? brain fart. i love gettting old
2016-02-19 03:32:55	+wiktor_b	doc235: fear, uncertainty, doubt
2016-02-19 03:33:05	+doc235	:) ty
2016-02-19 03:34:04	MooingLemur	brain farts leak knowledge?
2016-02-19 03:34:08	FrostFeline	am I the only one who renames all my interfaces back to what they were before all this persistent name nonsense?
2016-02-19 03:34:21	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: I don't let things rename them in the first place
2016-02-19 03:34:25	*	MooingLemur prefers the consistent names *shrug*
2016-02-19 03:34:25	 < 	salviadud (~Rgonzalez@189-211-190-134.static.axtel.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2016-02-19 03:34:30	+iamben	FrostFeline: i give mine more meaningful names, so they will actually be persistent AND readable
2016-02-19 03:34:41	+iamben	ie "lan" "wan" "public" etc
2016-02-19 03:34:43	FrostFeline	Anyone who was around before knew that you could just set the names by mac addr, pci ID etc
2016-02-19 03:34:48	FrostFeline	using udev
2016-02-19 03:34:54	+iamben	FrostFeline: yeah that's what i do
2016-02-19 03:35:09	+wiktor_b	MooingLemur: they used to be called "predictable" interface names, except that nobody could predict just which parameters will be used to construct the new interface name :)
2016-02-19 03:35:11	+iamben	this desktop has "bhanet" and "pubnet"
2016-02-19 03:35:22	MooingLemur	haha :3

2016-02-19 03:44:03	mvaenskae	#ARGHS
2016-02-19 03:44:11	mvaenskae	alright, back to stock android
2016-02-19 03:44:17	mvaenskae	googlke play services stopped
2016-02-19 03:44:26	mvaenskae	WHY DO THEY EFFIN STOP?!
2016-02-19 03:45:30	mvaenskae	some sqlite issue... i so fed up with this garbage
2016-02-19 03:45:42	mvaenskae	android is worse than ubunut
2016-02-19 03:45:56	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: put plasma on your phone
2016-02-19 03:46:07	mvaenskae	worse than mint, worse than ios for being such an annoyance
2016-02-19 03:46:09	+wiktor_b	http://plasma-mobile.org/
2016-02-19 03:46:42	*	mvaenskae is wondering how bad an iphone would be
2016-02-19 03:46:48	FrostFeline	At least iOS works well on all 3 of it's hadware platforms
2016-02-19 03:46:49	mvaenskae	seriously, this should NOT happen
2016-02-19 03:46:49	jaake	mvaenskae: it's worse
2016-02-19 03:46:51	FrostFeline	badumtss
2016-02-19 03:47:06	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: android is famously untested and beta quality
2016-02-19 03:47:11	mvaenskae	jaake: this is my 4th reinstall
2016-02-19 03:47:15	mvaenskae	today
2016-02-19 03:47:17	jaake	mvaenskae: Gapps are annoying to configure if you are non-stock
2016-02-19 03:47:18	mvaenskae	within 6 hours
2016-02-19 03:47:18	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: it's made by google, which means it's perma beta
2016-02-19 03:47:23	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Wait, even android 4/5?
2016-02-19 03:47:39	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: it's google which makes it beta
2016-02-19 03:47:40	jaake	mvaenskae: are you running cyanogenmod?
2016-02-19 03:47:47	MooingLemur	my stomach just mooed.
2016-02-19 03:47:51	mvaenskae	after i get to restoring my apps and such + my access points it becomes unusable and android services begin crashing
2016-02-19 03:47:55	FrostFeline	MooingLemur: You ate a cow :D
2016-02-19 03:47:56	mvaenskae	could they please NOT?=!
2016-02-19 03:48:03	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: NO google software ever gets past beta
2016-02-19 03:48:05	mvaenskae	jaake: i do
2016-02-19 03:48:09	MooingLemur	I haven't eaten anything yet today :P
2016-02-19 03:48:14	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: if it gets stable enough, they ditch it

2016-02-19 03:48:46	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: you probably didn't install the google play store app restoration service
2016-02-19 03:48:57	FrostFeline	nexus 5 is google's most hackable phone.
2016-02-19 03:49:18	FrostFeline	kali nethunter, cyanogenmod and those are just the most popular ones.
2016-02-19 03:49:20	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: yup and the best thing you can do to it is to put something else on it, hehe
2016-02-19 03:49:36	mvaenskae	i am not even using that, i have no idea what it backs up so i resort to using titanium for backups
2016-02-19 03:49:42	+wiktor_b	http://plasma-mobile.org/nexus-5/
2016-02-19 03:49:44	FrostFeline	Eh, on my LePan (4.x) android runs ok
2016-02-19 03:51:04	mvaenskae	i bought this nexus for android, not for anything else
2016-02-19 03:51:27	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: then you made a big mistake :)
2016-02-19 03:51:44	mvaenskae	i am not into finding alternatives of my apps/configs/etc
2016-02-19 03:51:59	mvaenskae	i have to spend my time with studies not these matters
2016-02-19 03:52:12	+wiktor_b	shoulda got an iphone then :)
2016-02-19 03:52:27	jaake	wiktor_b: no!
2016-02-19 03:52:36	jaake	iphone is much more horrible
2016-02-19 03:52:45	jaake	mvaenskae: if that's the case then you should have stayed stock
2016-02-19 03:52:54	mvaenskae	and please, stop the comments about nexus phones being the wrong choice for android; they were made specifically for android and are what iphones are to ios or the lumia phones to windows phone
2016-02-19 03:53:00	+doc235	my son writes apps for the Iphone
2016-02-19 03:53:03	jaake	don't mess with Android unless you have a lot of extra time
2016-02-19 03:53:03	+wiktor_b	jaake: at least it doesn't crash left and right
2016-02-19 03:53:15	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: nobody even mentioned it
2016-02-19 03:53:21	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: all I said was that android is crap :)
2016-02-19 03:53:27	mvaenskae	17:51:27 |+wiktor_b > mvaenskae: then you made a big mistake :)
2016-02-19 03:53:28	jaake	wiktor_b: my cyanogenmod MotoX 2014 works perfectly fine
2016-02-19 03:53:42	+wiktor_b	jaake: you're lucky but ok :)
2016-02-19 03:54:00	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: yeah, I never said nexus was the wrong choice for android
2016-02-19 03:54:07	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: in fact, it's probably your best shot
2016-02-19 03:54:08	mvaenskae	jaake: this isn't even a cm issue, this is an issue due to google play
2016-02-19 03:54:09	jaake	mvaenskae: are you having trouble installing gapps?
2016-02-19 03:54:12	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: doesn't mean android isn't crap
2016-02-19 03:54:27	jaake	mvaenskae: did you flash gapps from recovery?
2016-02-19 03:54:30	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: try an alternative package manager
2016-02-19 03:54:53	jaake	wiktor_b: that's not helpful, we can get gapps working I am sure,

2016-02-19 04:19:44	+iamben	shouldn't take more than a half dozen emerge commands and a few hours compiling =)
2016-02-19 04:19:51	jaake	lol
2016-02-19 04:19:52	jaake	right
2016-02-19 04:20:35	jaake	I don't feel like configuring network devices in VBox ever.
2016-02-19 04:21:15	jaake	it really wouldn't be too bad, I should do it just for the practice

2016-02-19 04:22:12	+iamben	wiktor_b: i think qt5/gtk3 make it much easier on UI/DE developers
2016-02-19 04:22:45	+wiktor_b	iamben: yes, as long as they're not doing crazy things like drawing their own widgets
2016-02-19 04:22:57	jaake	I guess not much, I was thinking about wpa_supplicant for some reason, but this would just be the emulated eth thingy that vbox does
2016-02-19 04:23:14	jaake	so basically just dhdcpd eth0 should do it
2016-02-19 04:23:24	+iamben	yeah it's just a basic wired NIC behind a NAT router, by default
2016-02-19 04:23:25	jaake	or enps0lp
2016-02-19 04:23:38	+iamben	it only gets slightly tricky if you need to access the guest from the host or outside, for server stuff
2016-02-19 04:24:20	jaake	yeah, I usually configure a bridged adaptor or w/e so the VM has own IP
2016-02-19 04:24:41	jaake	which is anoying only because I rearely go through the process
2016-02-19 04:24:41	+iamben	there's not much reason to do that for a desktop test though
2016-02-19 04:24:46	jaake	true true
2016-02-19 04:24:55	jaake	I'll do it!
2016-02-19 04:26:33	jaake	bbl off to lunch
2016-02-19 04:26:46	+iamben	when i've got a flaky windows desktop at work, i very often wipe windows and see if it will survive a full gentoo installation to a kde/gnome/whatever gui i feel like trying.  if it survives the full install then i declare teh hw good
2016-02-19 04:26:53	+iamben	so i do a lot of short-lived gentoo installs

2016-02-19 06:21:01	+doc235	i had a cop buy a laptop computer from me once that did something amazing that i still don't understand (background in electronics/electrical) he broght the laptop in, fired it up and opened his word processor pfs:write and said watch thich. turned on his radio and talked to someone and words typed (mixed with garbage) on the screen/. i told him it was impossile and that if i had not seen it i would laugh at him. i suggested he consult a

2016-02-19 06:26:18	_ohm	the developer manual is pretty good

2016-02-19 06:27:50	jaake	I'd guess someone wanted to hear some confidential info. Obviously they suck at hacking if it's outputting text into a word processor..
2016-02-19 06:29:34	+doc235	it was wierd
2016-02-19 06:29:47	jaake	yeah, that'd freak me out for sure
2016-02-19 06:29:53	+doc235	electronicly it was not possible but radio waves are strange creatures
2016-02-19 06:30:08	jaake	doc235: I doubt the radio had anything to do with it
2016-02-19 06:30:16	jaake	probably the mic on the laptop
2016-02-19 06:30:27	+doc235	it was a good trick if it didn't :)
2016-02-19 06:30:30	jaake	I'd disable the laptop mic then see if it happened
2016-02-19 06:31:04	jaake	maybe he has some kind of radio software on the machine
2016-02-19 06:31:34	jaake	it could even be that his radio was causing hardware interference that was being interpreted as keystrokes
2016-02-19 06:31:36	+doc235	i had sold 100 of these duplicate laptops to the State police barracks in connecticut and they bought printers, software computers cables paper etc etc etc :) but his was the only complaint :)

2016-02-19 07:30:43	Cheaterman	well me and the head dev
2016-02-19 07:30:56	Cheaterman	But these days he has pain in sysadmin (no wonder.... he decided to use Ubuntu server)
2016-02-19 07:31:07	Cheaterman	so I'm taking care of the (horrible) server
2016-02-19 07:31:23	+xiaomiao	ehehe
2016-02-19 07:32:41	Cheaterman	Hence my earlier "when you're not the IT guy"
2016-02-19 07:32:54	Cheaterman	Head dev taunted me about Gentoo maybe once or twice, when I was installing the things
2016-02-19 07:32:58	Cheaterman	He never did it again since then
2016-02-19 07:33:13	Cheaterman	I found so many flaws with his Ubuntu-based deployments and had to wipe his defecations so much
2016-02-19 07:33:20	Cheaterman	:D
2016-02-19 07:33:48	Cheaterman	and each time I found one I was like "this is why we need our own OS"
2016-02-19 07:33:50	Cheaterman	etc etc
2016-02-19 07:34:32	+iamben	i've never really used ubuntu server anywhere for real but i imagine it would be pretty ok up until you tried to do anything interesting
2016-02-19 07:35:13	Cheaterman	You got it, iamben. The main thing I don't like about Ubuntu (and I appreciate about simpler stuff like Gentoo and Python) is that there's usually one good way to do things and ideally only one
2016-02-19 07:35:24	Cheaterman	while on Ubuntu you get the "standard" way, plus 15 layers of userspace tools to simplify it
2016-02-19 07:35:25	+xiaomiao	iamben: yeah, then you start building from source
2016-02-19 07:35:31	Cheaterman	which obfuscates system administration to no end
2016-02-19 07:35:36	+xiaomiao	I used to have a tarball with the interesting tarballs
2016-02-19 07:35:39	+iamben	xiaomiao: yeah that's way too interesting for ubuntus

2016-02-19 07:38:27	+iamben	as i understand it, the boring parts of btrfs are ok and stable enough, but the interesting parts aren't
2016-02-19 07:38:44	+xiaomiao	iamben: interesting like, say, modifying files
2016-02-19 07:38:49	Cheaterman	Oh, so that's what it is. Because I know people already using it, so I indeed expected "normal" filesystem operation to work fine
2016-02-19 07:38:56	Cheaterman	but okay, what makes it interesting isn't ready yet
2016-02-19 07:38:57	Cheaterman	makes sense
2016-02-19 07:39:36	+iamben	the stuff like raid, dedup, snapshotting, whatever else... i dunno if it even has all those things
2016-02-19 07:39:39	Cheaterman	Guys, tell me more about ZFS against ext4 for instance?
2016-02-19 07:39:53	Cheaterman	Dedup is one of the interesting things I heard yes
2016-02-19 07:40:05	Cheaterman	snapshotting yes, I think I heard that once but forgot
2016-02-19 07:40:33	+iamben	im personally in "wait and see" mode on all those fancy things
2016-02-19 07:40:49	Cheaterman	Do you use anything fancy yet like XFS or reiser.
2016-02-19 07:40:50	Cheaterman	?
2016-02-19 07:41:00	+xiaomiao	xfs isn't fancy
2016-02-19 07:41:03	AwoL	Reiser is still around?
2016-02-19 07:41:05	AwoL	and it's fancy?
2016-02-19 07:41:06	+iamben	i have used xfs & reiserfs in the past
2016-02-19 07:41:12	*	AwoL used to really like ReiserFS back in the day...
2016-02-19 07:41:16	+xiaomiao	and since a while it's very robust, I haven't been able to kill it yet
2016-02-19 07:41:32	Cheaterman	Anything outside the mainstream ext2/3/4/vfat/ntfs is fancy to me hehe
2016-02-19 07:41:37	Cheaterman	even HFS
2016-02-19 07:41:38	+xiaomiao	ntfs :(
2016-02-19 07:42:00	Cheaterman	Yeah I heard good things about Reiser
2016-02-19 07:42:04	Cheaterman	Less so about his wife
2016-02-19 07:42:13	AwoL	haha
2016-02-19 07:42:18	+likewhoa	XFS for big files and lots of ram is great
2016-02-19 07:42:35	+xiaomiao	likewhoa: or massive concurrency
2016-02-19 07:42:35	Cheaterman	that's what I understood, and reiser kinda the opposite? smaller files, and bigger CPU?
2016-02-19 07:42:45	+likewhoa	ZFS snapshots are great specially when you zfs send/recv
2016-02-19 07:42:48	+likewhoa	xiaomiao: aye

2016-02-19 07:42:49	+xiaomiao	ext4 is the perfectly mediocre boring choice
2016-02-19 07:42:53	+xiaomiao	not bad ...
2016-02-19 07:43:06	Cheaterman	xiaomiao: I just don't see why use anything else
2016-02-19 07:43:09	AwoL	Cheaterman: last I checked....I used to put /etc/portage on a separate reiser partition.  It did seem to run a bit faster to me.
2016-02-19 07:43:15	AwoL	no
2016-02-19 07:43:17	Cheaterman	ext4 is hard enough to recover already, and it's supposed to be very well journaled
2016-02-19 07:43:18	AwoL	uhh..../usr/portage
2016-02-19 07:43:19	+likewhoa	AwoL: i used to also
2016-02-19 07:43:28	Cheaterman	AwoL: Okay, makes sense
2016-02-19 07:43:43	Cheaterman	some people do squashfs with it now right
2016-02-19 07:43:51	+xiaomiao	Cheaterman: because you're not in a hurry
2016-02-19 07:43:51	+likewhoa	Cheaterman: ZFS's block level checksums are a great feature also, specially the self healing feature.
2016-02-19 07:44:03	Cheaterman	xiaomiao: I hate I/O wait, if that's what you mean
2016-02-19 07:44:12	Cheaterman	But I happen to use relatively unintensive applications... on purpose
2016-02-19 07:44:15	+xiaomiao	Cheaterman: I have a small 256TB Ceph cluster at work
2016-02-19 07:44:27	+likewhoa	both btrfs and zfs are consider next-gen atomic copy-on-write COW filesystems.
2016-02-19 07:44:30	+likewhoa	xiaomiao: jelly
2016-02-19 07:44:34	Cheaterman	likewhoa: oh, zfs is more robust than ext4 by far then I suppose
2016-02-19 07:44:51	Cheaterman	likewhoa: Okay, I see
2016-02-19 07:44:53	+xiaomiao	likewhoa: eh, it's not as big as the elasticsearch cluster :)
2016-02-19 07:44:59	Cheaterman	so ZFS is kinda in the same category as btr, it's just more ready
2016-02-19 07:45:03	+iamben	xiaomiao: did you see lenovo now has the notebook you want, with up to 64GB ECC memory available?
2016-02-19 07:45:15	Cheaterman	ECC on laptop
2016-02-19 07:45:17	+xiaomiao	iamben: that's not a notebook, that's a mobile rack server ;)
2016-02-19 07:45:19	+iamben	i think that was you who wanted ECC anyway
2016-02-19 07:45:22	Cheaterman	exactly xiaomiao
2016-02-19 07:45:24	+iamben	xeon cpu available
2016-02-19 07:45:35	Cheaterman	iamben: definitely a portable server more than a laptop x)
2016-02-19 07:45:35	+iamben	well the xeon+ecc go hand in hand, of course
2016-02-19 07:45:43	+iamben	it is a mobile workstation, yes
2016-02-19 07:45:53	Cheaterman	does it come with a GPU

2016-02-19 07:46:29	Cheaterman	I mean, you'd need to do some very precise things to use so much processing power and memory
2016-02-19 07:46:29	+xiaomiao	something small and portable
2016-02-19 07:47:20	+iamben	it's about the size of a standard notebook, definitely not ultrabook/air/12" sized
2016-02-19 07:47:44	+xiaomiao	ultrabeeerk
2016-02-19 07:47:50	+xiaomiao	stupid marketing label
2016-02-19 07:48:32	+iamben	i added 3 different descriptors so you could pick the one you like

2016-02-19 07:52:32	+iamben	sorry
2016-02-19 07:54:08	Cheaterman	12"-sized was nice
2016-02-19 07:54:08	+xiaomiao	sometimes that's just incoherent
2016-02-19 07:54:12	Cheaterman	the rest is irrelevant indeed
2016-02-19 07:54:23	+xiaomiao	well, marketing
2016-02-19 07:54:32	+xiaomiao	"MMX" and innovation ...

2016-02-19 07:55:39	Cheaterman	iamben: air refers to macbook and ultrabook other than used as marketing term for laptops doesn't mean much to me
2016-02-19 07:55:50	+xiaomiao	iamben: so why even pretend to discuss?
2016-02-19 07:56:01	+iamben	i was trying to give you some useful information that i thought you'd like
2016-02-19 07:56:04	+iamben	sorry i ruined your day
2016-02-19 07:56:09	+xiaomiao	Cheaterman: ultrabook is a marketingterm from intel to enforce intel-only components, like centrino
2016-02-19 07:56:17	Cheaterman	interesting :/
2016-02-19 07:56:32	+xiaomiao	centrino was just intel cpu + intel wlan + ...
2016-02-19 07:56:41	+xiaomiao	you want the sticker, you follow intel's rules
2016-02-19 07:56:43	Cheaterman	iamben: indirectly you just did, xiaomiao taught me what an ultrabook is
2016-02-19 07:56:50	+iamben	Cheaterman: yes i specifically meant something macbook air sized, when i said "air"
2016-02-19 07:57:00	+xiaomiao	so it's a meaningless distinction among the ultraportable notebooks
2016-02-19 07:57:07	Cheaterman	Okay, but they're usually bigger than 12" no?
2016-02-19 07:57:07	+iamben	and i meant something "ultrabook sized"
2016-02-19 07:57:24	+iamben	Cheaterman: i know from previous discussions that he wants a small display

2016-02-19 07:57:44	+iamben	that is orthogonal
2016-02-19 07:57:53	+xiaomiao	exactly
2016-02-19 07:58:04	+xiaomiao	but if it's supposed to be portable it should be portable

2016-02-20 01:30:53	shingetsu	hi hosler
2016-02-20 01:30:55	+iamben	FrostFeline: so you dont have to remember what key does what?
2016-02-20 01:31:02	Cheaterman	owiiiiiiiiiiii doc235 shingetsu hosler
2016-02-20 01:31:16	shingetsu	so I figured out what the weird loading screen etc thing with plasma 5 was about
2016-02-20 01:31:22	shingetsu	iamben: interested for future reference?
2016-02-20 01:31:29	+iamben	shingetsu: sure
2016-02-20 01:31:40	tomboy64	iamben: any suggestion how to deal with this?
2016-02-20 01:31:44	+iamben	i think i saw some related bugs on the zilla
2016-02-20 01:31:45	+hosler	iamben: hi
2016-02-20 01:31:51	+hosler	Cheaterman: hi
2016-02-20 01:31:52	FrostFeline	iamben: Well you could use it for that.
2016-02-20 01:32:02	tomboy64	iamben: transcoding? or might there be a simpler solution?
2016-02-20 01:32:02	Cheaterman	owiiii ^__^
2016-02-20 01:32:03	+iamben	tomboy64: i think it's just a known limitation, 10bit color doesn't work with most hw dcode
2016-02-20 01:32:13	tomboy64	ah, i see
2016-02-20 01:32:15	tomboy64	thanks
2016-02-20 01:32:25	shingetsu	under certain circumstances, Mesa's GLX stuff can die if you're trying to set up wayland (because gles and egl is required) - when that happens, if Plasma 5's compositor is set to any OpenGL setting, and you're on Intel, it'll fail to work properly (because EGL is weird and no one knows how to use it except on really happy hardware, apparently)
2016-02-20 01:32:29	+iamben	it seems to be primarily used in animation/anime stuff
2016-02-20 01:32:51	shingetsu	=> if you're experiencing weird plasma 5 graphical issues, set the compositor settings on xrender rather than any OGL setting and you'll be good
2016-02-20 01:32:52	tomboy64	lol
2016-02-20 01:32:53	Cheaterman	interesting iamben, what is it? like quarter of the way to hdr?
2016-02-20 01:32:57	tomboy64	this is no anime, though :p
2016-02-20 01:33:11	+iamben	tomboy64: is it animated or a just a regular live action movie/vid?
2016-02-20 01:34:13	+wiktor_b	iamben: the anime rippers really seem to be putting in a lot of effort into ridiculously nice looking rips
2016-02-20 01:34:24	FrostFeline	iamben: I was thinking more like rebind things in LoL without cluttering up on-screen ui
2016-02-20 01:34:32	+wiktor_b	but I guess when they're ripping from a 10bit 4k 60Hz source...
2016-02-20 01:34:41	+iamben	Cheaterman: well i think it's just "more colors" like you'd expect, and it doesnt really matter much on live action video but on animated stuff there can be color banding
2016-02-20 01:34:52	+iamben	which 10bit may eliminate, i guess? im certainly no expert
2016-02-20 01:35:15	+wiktor_b	iamben: yeah and they you display it on your 6bit panel hehe

2016-02-20 01:36:58	+iamben	i'd guess it still looks marginally better, downsampling and dithering and what have you, i dunno.  regular 720p x264 is pretty much good enough for me
2016-02-20 01:37:17	Cheaterman	iamben: I see, thanks for the explanation, I also understood that x265 (HEVC) supports it
2016-02-20 01:37:27	FrostFeline	haha.... https://youtu.be/KxAT8cKxdOc Man-sized battery, costs 17 grand
2016-02-20 01:38:43	Cheaterman	iamben: 8 bit colors is usually good enough for anime, too, but more color depth can never hurt. however panels support only 8 bit colors for now I suppose, so I don't really see the point yet, unless you have a projector that supports deep color I suppose

2016-02-20 01:40:40	Cheaterman	or maybe there are intelligent ways to render deep color in 8 bits, like most deferred shading pipelines do with hdr right now
2016-02-20 01:40:47	Cheaterman	for video games
2016-02-20 01:41:15	shingetsu	well, stylistically drawings specifically have color palettes with lighting on top of it
2016-02-20 01:41:50	shingetsu	if we could separate out the coloring and the lighting (apply lighting post-color????) we could minimize the actual color data (by a lot)
2016-02-20 01:42:02	 > 	damex (~damex@funtoo/dev/damex) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-02-20 01:42:05	Cheaterman	yeah, have just solid color, and some sort of shading layer on top
2016-02-20 01:42:21	Cheaterman	but then just encode the anime in some sort of vector video
2016-02-20 01:42:23	Cheaterman	:)

2016-02-20 01:46:33	FrostFeline	I saw it in a vlc option once.
2016-02-20 01:46:46	shingetsu	you're *probably* thinking of an x264 option
2016-02-20 01:47:09	shingetsu	there is one that specializes in low-color amounts, but it's not quite on the same level as a fully specialized codec would be

2016-02-20 01:47:42	shingetsu	due to low color count it'd be possible to achieve really high compression rates while remaining lossless which'd be pretty cool
2016-02-20 01:47:49	gentwo	iamben: no there are no uefi thing in the bios , nor i did enable in kernel either..
2016-02-20 01:47:50	shingetsu	and then just bundle OpenGL shaders with the video or something
2016-02-20 01:47:56	FrostFeline	 I guess you could just encode your anime properly to avoid the issue.
2016-02-20 01:48:16	FrostFeline	And not have giant bands, but that's more #firstworldproblems
2016-02-20 01:48:25	gentwo	iamben: i guess this is all started the day change my hardrive, new SDD comes with problems?
2016-02-20 01:48:30	FrostFeline	Anime looks pretty good even with the bands
2016-02-20 01:48:36	 > 	DHex (~DHex@unaffiliated/dhex) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-02-20 01:48:38	shingetsu	gentwo: kernel has little to do with UEFI, and if your motherboard is UEFI-enabled, your bios IS uefi. Try finding something saying "CSM" or "Compatibility" mode in either boot or advanced sections
2016-02-20 01:48:41	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: if you have better colour information, you can use dithering to reduce banding
2016-02-20 01:48:48	shingetsu	gentwo: if you can use a mouse in your bios it's guaranteed to be UEFI, btw
2016-02-20 01:48:52	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: which is something that can become quite noticeable as iamben pointed out
2016-02-20 01:49:32	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: not
2016-02-20 01:49:37	+iamben	gentwo: i mainly asked about UEFI because most hardware which uses UEFI also has a very featureful config interface there, which can often update firmware w/o OS involvement
2016-02-20 01:49:51	gentwo	shingetsu: in CSM in kernel or bios?
2016-02-20 01:49:53	+iamben	go into "BIOS" and see if ther eis a firmware update feature
2016-02-20 01:50:05	+iamben	shingetsu: that is incorrect.
2016-02-20 01:50:10	+wiktor_b	iamben: hmmm, I've had half luck with that - quite a few efi laptops kicking about in the lab that have basically nothing in setup
2016-02-20 01:50:32	shingetsu	wiktor_b: "just about", you could fit all that into a regular bios but the prevailance of the feature and uefi came about the same time, as far as I'm aware
2016-02-20 01:50:44	+wiktor_b	iamben: like these new hp laptops with hybrid graphics that won't even let you pick which gpu you want
2016-02-20 01:51:14	shingetsu	gentwo: there is no "in CSM", it's a potential value for a legacy/compatibility option. And as I said, the kernel has little to nothing to do with what your motherboard is doing, so in bios.
2016-02-20 01:51:20	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: I've seen quite a few non-efi boxes with a graphical setup program and mouse support
2016-02-20 01:51:28	+iamben	right, UEFI doesn't imply fancy flashy config UI, or vice versa, but they both became common at the same time
2016-02-20 01:51:43	shingetsu	wiktor_b: I've seen a total of 0, but they very often do come to gether either way
2016-02-20 01:51:52	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: okay, I see, that's also the point of hdr in deferred shading iirc
2016-02-20 01:51:53	shingetsu	iamben: I was oversimplifying, since that seems to be the way to go in this particular case
2016-02-20 01:51:57	+iamben	seems like a lot of vendors waited until the UEFI "push" to totally revamp their config UI
2016-02-20 01:52:03	shingetsu	they probably did
2016-02-20 01:52:04	+iamben	shingetsu: right, i think we're on the same page
2016-02-20 01:52:08	shingetsu	more space = easier to set it up
2016-02-20 01:52:10	shingetsu	:)
2016-02-20 01:52:59	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: the idea is the same: keep as much "resolution"/information as you can for the calculations, downsample at the very end of the pipeline
2016-02-20 01:53:00	shingetsu	iamben: just to make sure (I wasn't here when the discussion started), I'm assuming gentwo got a new drive, tried to install *nix unto it and  failed because he's UEFI-"enabled", right?
2016-02-20 01:53:33	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: it's like audio production at 96kHz - way too high for CD quality, but very useful in the studio
2016-02-20 01:53:45	+iamben	shingetsu: he's getting some "low memory corruption" warnings/errors in dmesg, which apparently usually means the bios is doing something funky, since linux itself doesnt modify that low mem
2016-02-20 01:53:49	*	shingetsu still thinks it'd be interesting to apply shading dynamically in a video-file context
2016-02-20 01:53:53	+iamben	so i figured a biod update check was in order
2016-02-20 01:53:56	shingetsu	aha
2016-02-20 01:54:15	shingetsu	gentwo: what's your motherboard model?
2016-02-20 01:54:21	+wiktor_b	iamben: it's not actually that low
2016-02-20 01:54:24	+iamben	the HP bios update is "windows only" but often you can unpack on another windows or wine, and feed the raw biosupdate.bin file via the BIOS/UEFI config menu
2016-02-20 01:54:31	+wiktor_b	6k in isn't that low :)
2016-02-20 01:54:54	+iamben	wiktor_b: it's designated as "low memory", i dont really care "how low"
2016-02-20 01:54:57	shingetsu	iamben: don't they supply ISOs anymore? :^)
2016-02-20 01:55:11	+iamben	shingetsu: looks like the windows .exe allows creating a liveusb
2016-02-20 01:55:15	*	shingetsu corrupts 2bit-in memory
2016-02-20 01:55:18	FrostFeline	dell doesn't supply it's bios update as an ISO.
2016-02-20 01:55:23	FrostFeline	for my old box
2016-02-20 01:55:35	shingetsu	iamben: then there's probably some image somewhere within the exe (or it downloads it from somewhere), so extracting and dd-ing is a possibility
2016-02-20 01:55:36	+iamben	FrostFeline: dell supplies a .EXE which generally runs in windows OR via freedos, fwiw
2016-02-20 01:55:39	FrostFeline	They expect windows or msdos to be running
2016-02-20 01:55:49	+iamben	you can boot freedos from grub for this
2016-02-20 01:55:56	shingetsu	I guess that'd work too~
2016-02-20 01:56:06	FrostFeline	Yes, still have to figure that out
2016-02-20 01:56:20	FrostFeline	I got freedos to boot, but couldn't access usb etc :P
2016-02-20 01:56:52	FrostFeline	I'll worry about it when I get my extra ram
2016-02-20 01:57:14	+iamben	i think you're suposed to include the bios blob in your freedos image directly, but my memory is a bit fuzzy on this now

2016-02-20 02:14:48	shingetsu	iamben: it does look like an old bios, but updating might be a big enough pain in this specific scenario that just reserving the low memory and telling the bios to "go crazy" might just work... if it doesn't then we'll know the BIOS is doing something more than funky
2016-02-20 02:15:16	gentwo	iamben: how about install windows and update the bios?

2016-02-20 02:34:01	gentwo	shingetsu: results after disabling the error check, https://bpaste.net/show/807874680ddc
2016-02-20 02:34:42	shingetsu	gentwo: you didn't follow instructions, the memmap=64K$0 kernel line parameter is missing
2016-02-20 02:34:46	shingetsu	you need to do BOTH
2016-02-20 02:34:55	+wiktor_b	gentwo: if you disable error checking, you'll get no error reports
2016-02-20 02:34:58	shingetsu	that's why I said to write it up *exactly*
2016-02-20 02:35:43	gentwo	sorry, going back
2016-02-20 02:35:50	shingetsu	wiktor_b: it looks like the BIOS is writing to low memory (which it's allowed to) but not bothering to notify the kernel (because windows doesn't use it, right? so who cares) and (potentially due to the new SSD?) the kernel doesn't like that
2016-02-20 02:36:27	gentwo	shingetsu: the 64K ( K) should be there?
2016-02-20 02:36:52	shingetsu	gentwo: exactly the following: "memmap=64K$0 memory_corruption_check=0", with the dollar sign after the captial k
2016-02-20 02:37:11	shingetsu	literally exactly that (without the ")

2016-02-20 02:53:09	FrostFeline	With that much wattage you could run a femtocell
2016-02-20 02:53:37	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: that's a virtual address, it's remapped: [   62.721181] Corrupted low memory at ffff880000006598 (6598 phys) = ff0000000000

2016-02-20 02:53:52	+iamben	i mean, whole notebook
2016-02-20 02:53:56	+iamben	i think you haev a bug
2016-02-20 02:54:03	+iamben	(in powertop reporting)
2016-02-20 02:54:16	FrostFeline	powertop crashes on my acer c720
2016-02-20 02:54:24	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: the bios is wiritng to conventional memory which is verbotten and is a bios bug
2016-02-20 02:54:32	Cheaterman	wow didn't know that tool, thanks iamben
2016-02-20 02:54:34	damex	iamben, i tried different kernel - no change. checked powertop on 14.04 ubuntu liveusb... seems to be much better
2016-02-20 02:54:47	+iamben	damex: powertop-1 or -2?
2016-02-20 02:54:53	damex	atleast acpitool and tray tools report around half an hour more battery life

2016-02-20 02:55:16	shingetsu	wiktor_b: hmm... what I was describing is a "feature" as well, but according to the kernel (at least), 6598 phys is within low mem
2016-02-20 02:55:42	damex	iamben, 2.6 on gentoo
2016-02-20 02:55:51	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: but still something the kernel uses, clearly :)
2016-02-20 02:56:06	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: though the protect low mem option can be tweaked quite high
2016-02-20 02:56:22	damex	not sure about ubuntu
2016-02-20 02:56:27	damex	i didn't paid attention
2016-02-20 02:56:34	shingetsu	wiktor_b: the kernel feels free to use low mem because it's perfectly good ram, why not use it
2016-02-20 02:56:43	+iamben	damex: 1.x is a totally different codebase, did it act very different or mostly the same, like menu & features-wise?
2016-02-20 02:56:56	shingetsu	wiktor_b: when the bios uses it it's supposed to tell the OS about it (I don't quite remember how), but when it doesn't this stuff happens
2016-02-20 02:57:02	shingetsu	which I've already said
2016-02-20 02:57:09	+wiktor_b	shingetsu, gentwo: try to set CONFIG_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR=65536
2016-02-20 02:57:21	damex	iamben, it had less features and i couldn't see wattage on ubuntu.
2016-02-20 02:57:28	Cheaterman	lol in my top power users, pulseaudio xD
2016-02-20 02:57:31	shingetsu	wiktor_b: memmap=64K$0 will do the same thing, effectively
2016-02-20 02:57:45	damex	iamben, probably 1.x
2016-02-20 02:57:46	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 6598 is within conventional memory and is outside the e820 memory map
2016-02-20 02:57:54	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: it's guaranteed to be free
2016-02-20 02:58:23	shingetsu	wiktor_b: BIOSes typically feel free to use it anyway though, because windows doesn't use anything up to 64k
2016-02-20 02:58:27	damex	anyway without enforced power stuff on ubuntu it eats less battery with full fledged gnome3. on gentoo with ripped everything down and compiled for current arch it eats much more power ;(
2016-02-20 02:58:30	shingetsu	(well, no, not typically)
2016-02-20 02:58:31	+iamben	damex: well just dont take either powertop version's output as gospel =)
2016-02-20 02:58:33	shingetsu	(some do though)
2016-02-20 02:58:42	shingetsu	(and that's a bug)
2016-02-20 02:58:44	damex	iamben, i compared uptime :(
2016-02-20 02:58:53	damex	and then i check powertop...
2016-02-20 02:59:04	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: from what I know bioses usually don't do evil things to conventional memory, and when they do they're evil and/or buggy
2016-02-20 02:59:24	shingetsu	wiktor_b: this is HP we're talking about though
2016-02-20 02:59:31	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: Has Problems
2016-02-20 02:59:35	shingetsu	yes
2016-02-20 02:59:35	damex	iamben, i wonder what i can do about it ...
2016-02-20 02:59:39	damex	it just eats tons of power
2016-02-20 02:59:51	+iamben	damex: same cpu governor & scaler?

2016-02-20 03:00:27	damex	it does not have governor sadly. defaults.
2016-02-20 03:00:27	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 0x500-07ffff is guaranteed to be free, hence its name (conventional memory) :)
2016-02-20 03:00:41	damex	kernel version is different...
2016-02-20 03:00:51	damex	here is 4.4.2 and there 3.18 afair
2016-02-20 03:01:00	+iamben	damex: well it will have some governor, check "cpupower frequency-info"
2016-02-20 03:01:11	*	shingetsu guarantees 0x-1 is free :^)
2016-02-20 03:01:11	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: if you use it it's not free anymore, and if everyone does the same, there's no guarantee :D
2016-02-20 03:01:22	gentwo	shingetsu: it hangs the system during the bootup, "Decompressing linux... Parsing ELF..done. booting the kernel,, thats the end of it.. it hangs if i were to add after root=/dev/sda4 ro
2016-02-20 03:01:37	damex	iamben, don't even have that one
2016-02-20 03:01:52	+iamben	damex: on older systems it may be "cpufreqinfo something something"
2016-02-20 03:02:14	shingetsu	hmmmm... gentwo iamben - so looks like your bios is indeed "evil"
2016-02-20 03:02:19	damex	 t420 with novidia + quadcore cpu
2016-02-20 03:02:26	+iamben	cpufrequtils/cpufreqinfo was replaced by the cpupower tool, upstream
2016-02-20 03:02:27	damex	sandy bridge on that thinkpad
2016-02-20 03:02:56	gentwo	shingetsu: install windows and update bios?

2016-02-20 03:03:03	shingetsu	gentwo: probably
2016-02-20 03:03:12	gentwo	then back to gentwo,,

2016-02-20 03:08:13	+iamben	it's a kernel config issue most likely

2016-02-20 04:09:23	+shingetsu	rsync is not something you use when you want to gofasts, rsync is a flexible tool for mass transfers
2016-02-20 04:09:36	+shingetsu	scp is even slower, but that isn't saying much
2016-02-20 04:09:53	+FrostFeline	What
2016-02-20 04:09:56	+shingetsu	(rolling checksums \o/)
2016-02-20 04:10:00	+FrostFeline	What's special about scp that's slower?
2016-02-20 04:10:03	+FrostFeline	oh
2016-02-20 04:10:20	+FrostFeline	Well I figured out it was my mac's disc that was slow :^)
2016-02-20 04:10:28	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: the checksums is on rsync, scp isn't really made for performance, but rather as a bonus to ssh in general
2016-02-20 04:10:35	+shingetsu	and I know, commenting on something else~
2016-02-20 04:10:50	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: What about ssh hpn?
2016-02-20 04:11:03	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: You could do sftp/scp with rc4 cipher
2016-02-20 04:11:22	+FrostFeline	and something light like md5 I guess.
2016-02-20 04:11:25	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: mac minis are not designed for performance
2016-02-20 04:11:38	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: well, to start with, gentoo enables hpn by default :P
2016-02-20 04:11:40	+shingetsu	and that's still rc4
2016-02-20 04:11:56	+shingetsu	even with no cipher you're getting computational overhead unless you stub the whole thing out
2016-02-20 04:12:10	+iamben	FrostFeline: are you just benchmarking/testing at this point, or do you actually have large amounts of data you're going to (regularly?) transfer?
2016-02-20 04:12:13	+iamben	just curious
2016-02-20 04:12:19	+shingetsu	if you were building something for raw transfer performance you'd go in a wildly different direction
2016-02-20 04:12:56	+FrostFeline	iamben: I'm just testing.
2016-02-20 04:13:09	+shingetsu	you'll almost always be bottlenecked by hard drives
2016-02-20 04:13:19	+FrostFeline	It's a small fileserver with only 4TB of storage space on 2 disks.
2016-02-20 04:13:20	+shingetsu	until you start using PCIe/M.2 SSDs in raid0
2016-02-20 04:13:40	+FrostFeline	No, not with raid0
2016-02-20 04:13:42	+iamben	if you ONLY want to test network/protocol perf, use some tmpfs or use /dev/zero /dev/null
2016-02-20 04:14:01	+shingetsu	probably /dev/null
2016-02-20 04:14:25	AsumFace	i'd generate some pseudorandom data with openssl and transmit it using netcat in udp mode
2016-02-20 04:14:26	+FrostFeline	Each of my WD green drives is fast enough to go about ~75% of a gigabit connection
2016-02-20 04:14:33	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: hold on, let me get an enterprise grade 10GBps network card and demonstrate a single PCIe SSD bottlenecking ;)
2016-02-20 04:15:23	+FrostFeline	Yeah... 1 Gigabit is more than enough for some backups
2016-02-20 04:15:34	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: the fastest a WD green has gone in sequential (which is highest) is 120MB/s
2016-02-20 04:15:35	+FrostFeline	Of a 1TB disk.
2016-02-20 04:15:54	+shingetsu	which is pretty close to 1 gigabit, sure, but come on~ :^)
2016-02-20 04:16:00	+FrostFeline	or to store video 720p files.
2016-02-20 04:16:26	+FrostFeline	Yes, and with lvm raid0, it's not even a challenge to reach gigabit with 2 disks
2016-02-20 04:16:35	+wiktor_b	< AsumFace> i'd generate some pseudorandom data with openssl
2016-02-20 04:16:37	+shingetsu	sure~
2016-02-20 04:16:47	+shingetsu	but that's in sequential
2016-02-20 04:16:50	+wiktor_b	AsumFace: why not dd if=/dev/urandom ?

2016-02-20 04:17:06	+shingetsu	data will typically be fairly scattered, even if not on a per-file basis
2016-02-20 04:17:08	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Which is the only transfer I'd be doing for video files :)
2016-02-20 04:17:13	AsumFace	wiktor_b: /dev/urandom is slower than /dev/zero
2016-02-20 04:17:27	+wiktor_b	AsumFace: /dev/zero is not random
2016-02-20 04:17:42	+iamben	wiktor_b: no way!
2016-02-20 04:17:44	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: gigabit SSDs already exist
2016-02-20 04:17:51	AsumFace	wiktor_b: the encryption makes it random enough
2016-02-20 04:17:53	+shingetsu	wiktor_b: but not 10 gigabit
2016-02-20 04:17:54	+iamben	depending on what you're testing, random data may or may not be important
2016-02-20 04:17:55	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: in fact, they're trivial
2016-02-20 04:17:57	+shingetsu	wiktor_b: which was my point
2016-02-20 04:18:00	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: close to 10 gigabit
2016-02-20 04:18:04	+shingetsu	close, but not quite :^)
2016-02-20 04:18:21	+FrostFeline	Why would random data matter much?
2016-02-20 04:18:41	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: 1. latency. 2. real data is relatively random and in chunks.
2016-02-20 04:19:08	+shingetsu	Sequential is a measure of how fast it can possibly go, Random 4K is a measure of how it'll probably perform on average
2016-02-20 04:19:16	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: The disk controller cares about how random the data it is?
2016-02-20 04:19:26	+shingetsu	the big advantage of SSDs is that their random is very close to sequential
2016-02-20 04:19:31	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: the spinning needle does
2016-02-20 04:19:56	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Oh... you're talking about the randomness of the file arrangement?
2016-02-20 04:20:23	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: 1. fragmentation. 2. file arrangement.
2016-02-20 04:20:40	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 1108.4 MB/s at offset   0 GB using  64 KiB reads
2016-02-20 04:20:40		[04:20]
2016-02-20 04:20:43	+shingetsu	Random 4K benchmarks serve because they're closer to real-world application, where files will be "somewhere"
2016-02-20 04:20:44	+FrostFeline	Right
2016-02-20 04:20:44	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: do the maths
2016-02-20 04:20:58	+FrostFeline	Fortunately I don't have to deal with either of those.
2016-02-20 04:21:12	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: just a quick test, there's some other drive activity going on
2016-02-20 04:21:17	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 1155.0 MB/s at offset 102 GB using  64 KiB reads
2016-02-20 04:21:37	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 1193.0 MB/s at offset 205 GB using  64 KiB reads
2016-02-20 04:21:39	+wiktor_b	etc
2016-02-20 04:21:44	+shingetsu	wiktor_b: that's pretty simple math there
2016-02-20 04:21:48	+shingetsu	so yeah just under 10 gigabit
2016-02-20 04:22:04	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 9544 bit/s
2016-02-20 04:22:08	AsumFace	wiktor_b: sorry if i wasn't explicit enough. a way to generate large amounts of 'random' data is to pipe /dev/zero into openssl and encrypt it. that generates around 14Gbit/s per core on my machine
2016-02-20 04:22:31	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: within 500 bps, it's basically 10 gigabit as tcp overhead will eat up even more
2016-02-20 04:22:37	*	shingetsu is still waiting for 10 gigaBYte enterprise network cards
2016-02-20 04:22:43	+shingetsu	that's true~
2016-02-20 04:22:49	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Linus set up a 160TB monster server with multiple 10Gbps nics bonded
2016-02-20 04:22:56	*	shingetsu gets a second enterprise grade 10 gigabit network card
2016-02-20 04:23:06	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: and then it died
2016-02-20 04:23:09	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: So the editor workstations could use the server itself as "disk"
2016-02-20 04:23:18	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Yeah he lost a raid card.
2016-02-20 04:23:20	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: also, that was honestly really silly, imo
2016-02-20 04:23:21	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: 8x10 gigabit card hehe
2016-02-20 04:23:33	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: But he got his data back :D
2016-02-20 04:23:37	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: iirc they're NOT using the standard approach to editing (which is huffyuv+pcm intermediate format)
2016-02-20 04:23:47	+shingetsu	and using some weird proprietary codec instead
2016-02-20 04:23:50	+shingetsu	because they can't software :^)
2016-02-20 04:24:01	+shingetsu	yes wiktor_b, exactly \o/
2016-02-20 04:24:07	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: so yeah gigabit drives already exist, I'm sure there's lots of drives faster than mine
2016-02-20 04:24:08	+FrostFeline	Ok...?
2016-02-20 04:24:15	+FrostFeline	Why does that matter?
2016-02-20 04:24:23	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: because it bugs me :)
2016-02-20 04:24:27	+FrostFeline	lol
2016-02-20 04:24:46	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: The important thing to me was that the link was fast enough that you could use the fileserver as a normal harddisk
2016-02-20 04:24:51	+FrostFeline	:^)
2016-02-20 04:25:06	+shingetsu	a "normal" hard drive isn't all that amazing, so of course it was
2016-02-20 04:25:22	+shingetsu	a gigabit connection is faster than a 5400RPM HDD, so...
2016-02-20 04:25:29	+shingetsu	why wouldn't it be?
2016-02-20 04:25:46	+iamben	FrostFeline: latency will be an issue
2016-02-20 04:25:49	+shingetsu	and a single thunderbolt cable is fast enough to carry a 4K display + all peripheral IO on it
2016-02-20 04:25:56	+FrostFeline	iamben: On an intranet? ehhhh....
2016-02-20 04:26:12	+iamben	compared to local? latency will be pretty huge.  that may or may not affect your use-case
2016-02-20 04:26:33	+FrostFeline	When would the latency matter?
2016-02-20 04:26:34	+shingetsu	iamben: well, the use case in question is gigantic 4K video editing, so it's pure sequential (effectively) with single file
2016-02-20 04:26:41	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: samsung XP941 (MZHPU256)
2016-02-20 04:26:43	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: latency matters every time you request a file
2016-02-20 04:26:56	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: fixed vs variable costs
2016-02-20 04:27:08	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Yes, but his server had 8nics
2016-02-20 04:27:19	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: I think it could handle a lot of simultaneous requests :P
2016-02-20 04:27:30	+FrostFeline	Without bottlenecking*
2016-02-20 04:27:33	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: reading 1 000 000 000 10-bit files will be slower than reading a single 100 000 000 000-bit file
2016-02-20 04:27:45	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: no, the latency is due to the request going through the network
2016-02-20 04:28:03	+shingetsu	for transfers it doesn't matter, for requests it does, since those SHOULD be atomic, but stop being such
2016-02-20 04:28:22	+shingetsu	if you have a "smart" io scheduler, it'll only be worse
2016-02-20 04:28:28	+shingetsu	(deadline is a good idea for that use case)
2016-02-20 04:28:31	+FrostFeline	Yes, but if you've already got multiple 10gig nics teamed, when is the latency going to matter? What applications?
2016-02-20 04:28:47	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: I already answered that question.
2016-02-20 04:28:47	+FrostFeline	Over an intranet you can easily be under 1ms
2016-02-20 04:29:13	+wiktor_b	the latency is still going to be better than super expensive HDDs
2016-02-20 04:29:38	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: 1 ms per request

2016-02-20 04:30:21	+shingetsu	aka 1 billion requests
2016-02-20 04:30:21	+FrostFeline	I meant what applications as in what application software.

2016-02-20 04:30:34	+wiktor_b	shingetsu: I'm wagering 10-20 ms per request max, full round trip from fread() to data ending up in the buffer
2016-02-20 04:30:50	+FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Don't forget sendfile :)
2016-02-20 04:30:52	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: that was a hyperboled example, reading the same amount of data but broken up in more files will always be slower under such circumstances (where requests are non-atomic)
2016-02-20 04:31:03	+wiktor_b	anyway

2016-02-20 04:31:17	+FrostFeline	What application software is going to make that many requests to the disk at once?
2016-02-20 04:31:25	+shingetsu	literally anything?

2016-02-20 04:31:33	+shingetsu	a browsers' cache, operating system booting, etc
2016-02-20 04:32:02	+iamben	yeah most real world usage is a whole lot of small reads/writes all over the disk, that's why ssd's make such a huge difference
2016-02-20 04:32:07	*	shingetsu nods
2016-02-20 04:32:13	+FrostFeline	Well a browser's cache isn't going to be that large, you can put it on a dinky little 2.5 inch hdd.
2016-02-20 04:32:22	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: the SIZE doesn't matter, it's the AMOUNT
2016-02-20 04:32:27	+shingetsu	as I've been saying for a while now
2016-02-20 04:32:32	+shingetsu	how MANY files vs how MUCH data
2016-02-20 04:32:40	+iamben	the 120MB/s spinning disk sequential read going to 400MB/s doesnt matter so much, the 10k+ IOPS is what matters
2016-02-20 04:32:46	bluearc	FrostFeline: Clearly, you're not aware of all of the pr0n browsing I do !!!!
2016-02-20 04:32:51	+shingetsu	in their use case it's fine because it's 1 file at a time, and it's really big
2016-02-20 04:33:02	+shingetsu	but it isn't something you should do to just have a hard drive elsewhere
2016-02-20 04:33:03	+FrostFeline	Yes, I heard you. and my google chrome browser runs just fine on a 2.5 inch hdd
2016-02-20 04:33:15	+shingetsu	yeah, and what does that have to do with anything?
2016-02-20 04:33:17	salviadud	bluearc, would u be interested in some ffmpeg pr0n?
2016-02-20 04:33:23	+FrostFeline	You could throw chrome at literally any disk and it'll be fine. :p
2016-02-20 04:33:27	bluearc	Not at this time!
2016-02-20 04:33:32	+shingetsu	which is unrelated to my point FrostFeline
2016-02-20 04:33:41	+shingetsu	please don't move goalposts :P
2016-02-20 04:34:00	+FrostFeline	I strapped the goalposts to a truck
2016-02-20 04:34:05	salviadud	It sounds like some hellish KVM setup
2016-02-20 04:34:07	+shingetsu	r00d
2016-02-20 04:34:07	+iamben	FrostFeline: performance will be quite different depending on your disk read/write latency.  disk size or linear/sequential read doesnt matter
2016-02-20 04:34:20	+iamben	chrome perf, i mean
2016-02-20 04:34:39	+FrostFeline	Yeah chrome perf.
2016-02-20 04:34:52	+FrostFeline	But chrome is already very fast on even the cheapest disks.
2016-02-20 04:35:16	+FrostFeline	Then again you could just install more ram if you want a faster browser.
2016-02-20 04:35:31	+FrostFeline	Maybe you're one of those people who uses tabs as bookmarks
2016-02-20 04:35:37	+iamben	that's Cheaterman
2016-02-20 04:35:45	jaake	heh
2016-02-20 04:35:45		[04:35]
2016-02-20 04:36:00	+iamben	anyway we were just trying to say that if your'e reading tons of small files all over the place, latency matters
2016-02-20 04:36:32	jaake	the filesystem overhead comes into play as well, not just the hardware
2016-02-20 04:36:48	+FrostFeline	I'm using LVM+ext4, personally
2016-02-20 04:38:24	+FrostFeline	I play some games on my mac mini.

2016-02-20 04:40:50	jaake	brb lunch
2016-02-20 04:41:19	+Smiley	not according to steam FrostFeline ? :/
2016-02-20 04:41:58	salviadud	jaake, that's from 2011
2016-02-20 04:42:16	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: also, on open files, you can run "find /proc/*/fd | wc -l" to see how many files are open at a given moment
2016-02-20 04:42:30	+shingetsu	each one of those files is at least a 1ms slowdown ;)
2016-02-20 04:42:36	+shingetsu	(2500 for me, at the moment)
2016-02-20 04:43:03	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Eh, 1ms for that applications
2016-02-20 04:43:22	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: yes, which still applies to the system
2016-02-20 04:43:26	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: If you have multiple open and they each have files open, then they can request in parallel.
2016-02-20 04:43:29	+shingetsu	wheeee 2.5 second slowdown \o/
2016-02-20 04:43:40	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: who manages that paralellization? ;)
2016-02-20 04:43:59	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: The disk scheduler, I'm guessing
2016-02-20 04:44:27	+FrostFeline	or the applications themselves?
2016-02-20 04:45:47	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: But if you have a large document open in photoshop and word, why would both of their request latencies add up together?
2016-02-20 04:46:07	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: because the requests are separate
2016-02-20 04:46:09	+Smiley	<ps request><word request>
2016-02-20 04:46:11	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: On a normal system those thousands of requests will be from hundreds of processes.
2016-02-20 04:46:13	+Smiley	<-----2.5ms---->
2016-02-20 04:46:31	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: yes, but what does that CHANGE in what I said?
2016-02-20 04:46:36	+shingetsu	it's still a slowdown of the entire system
2016-02-20 04:46:52	+shingetsu	every time you want to flush a buffer, and every time you try to read it'll have bonus latency
2016-02-20 04:47:02	+shingetsu	if the scheduler is too smart, it'll make it worse
2016-02-20 04:47:09	+Smiley	FrostFeline: no where othr than wikipedia seems to list it with linux support.
2016-02-20 04:47:12	+FrostFeline	It's easy to solve that by downloading more RAM :)
2016-02-20 04:47:36	+shingetsu	if the disk firmware on the other end is too smart (and you don't have a proper dedicate pre-send buffer) that'll slow it down even more
2016-02-20 04:47:46	+FrostFeline	Smiley: IGN list it as linux compatibil
2016-02-20 04:48:11	+FrostFeline	and so does humblebundle.com.... was the linux version pulled?
2016-02-20 04:48:36	+Smiley	it's a bit... odd
2016-02-20 04:48:37	+shingetsu	Smiley: according to steam it is available on linux, scroll down to the system requirements bit
2016-02-20 04:48:39	+shingetsu	and look at it
2016-02-20 04:48:41	+Smiley	people on amazon comments saying it works
2016-02-20 04:49:03	+shingetsu	well yeah, because it does

2016-02-20 04:50:53	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Right, Anyway, what I was asking was, why would 2 1ms requests from 2 different applications add up to 2ms? I know there's a bunch of other things that can come into play but...
2016-02-20 04:50:53		[04:50]
2016-02-20 04:51:10	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: they could add up to 3ms ;
2016-02-20 04:51:11	+shingetsu	;)
2016-02-20 04:51:12	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Why wouldn't it sometimes be 1ms for both or sometimes be 2 or something in between?
2016-02-20 04:51:26	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: because each has to be processed separately
2016-02-20 04:51:48	+FrostFeline	Yes, by the disks on the server.
2016-02-20 04:51:52	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: then combined with the factors I listed above, there's a good chance it'll actually be MORE than 2ms
2016-02-20 04:51:59	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: by the scheduler *and* the disks on the server
2016-02-20 04:52:04	+shingetsu	which are on different ends of a cable
2016-02-20 04:52:44	+FrostFeline	So at the end of the day... Is it going to be noticable?
2016-02-20 04:53:09	+FrostFeline	After your machine is booted of course.
2016-02-20 04:53:19	+shingetsu	depends on how attentive you are
2016-02-20 04:53:23	+shingetsu	everything will be noticeably slower
2016-02-20 04:53:32	+shingetsu	imagine downclocking your CPU by 100MHz
2016-02-20 04:53:44	+shingetsu	it WILL decrease performance, but whether you notice it or not depends on you
2016-02-20 04:53:57	+FrostFeline	Haha... 100mHz shouldn't be noticable on modern desktops
2016-02-20 04:54:14	+shingetsu	of course, under some applications it'll make a massive difference, e.g computing prime numbers (that you're caching the comps of ala 2 pass, for some reason)
2016-02-20 04:54:20	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: why? ;)
2016-02-20 04:55:07	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: It doesn't matter how many megahertz you have if you're not fully loading your CPU in the first place
2016-02-20 04:55:19	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: for reference, I could tell when my CPU used to throttle/boost (3.8GHz, throttled down to 3.3, boosted up to 4.1)
2016-02-20 04:55:23	+shingetsu	I am!
2016-02-20 04:55:27	+shingetsu	on a regular basis!

2016-02-20 04:57:45	+FrostFeline	Anyway, was the storinator ridiculous for other reasons besides latency?
2016-02-20 04:58:01	+shingetsu	not really, noo
2016-02-20 04:58:14	+shingetsu	a gigabit connection is faster than a 5400RPM HDD
2016-02-20 04:58:32	+shingetsu	so it makes sense, as long as it's implemented well and your use case doesn't do the thing
2016-02-20 04:58:47	+FrostFeline	I guess their use case didn't do the thing.
2016-02-20 04:58:50	+FrostFeline	:D
2016-02-20 04:58:51	+shingetsu	it didn't~
2016-02-20 04:58:59	+shingetsu	their use case is a SINGLE file that happens to be really big
2016-02-20 04:59:05	+shingetsu	aka the definition of sequential read

2016-02-20 05:02:31	+FrostFeline	I notice on the xcom2 page for steam they give a nice icon for mac os x and windows
2016-02-20 05:02:36	+FrostFeline	Why no linux penguin?
2016-02-20 05:02:56	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: because SteamOS
2016-02-20 05:03:02	+shingetsu	there's a nice steam logo icon ;)
2016-02-20 05:03:15	+FrostFeline	Oh, so that's what that means

2016-02-20 05:03:32	+Smiley	there used to be a penguin :/
2016-02-20 05:03:40	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: steamplay used to mean "available on multiple platforms"
2016-02-20 05:03:56	+shingetsu	what it means now is... uh.... dependent on the inclination of whoever's managing adding things to the store that day
2016-02-20 05:04:21	+FrostFeline	That's really dumb

2016-02-20 05:04:55	+FrostFeline	Why is it so much trouble to just put 3 logos instead of "it works on multiple platforms and stuff" steamplay icon.

2016-02-20 05:05:59	+shingetsu	cookiemon5ter: sure, but you can just install steam in any other distro and it'll work just as well
2016-02-20 05:06:11	+shingetsu	wow, much mature, very insightful
2016-02-20 05:06:12	+FrostFeline	but they list mac and windows seperately, so that's just plain obnoxious.
2016-02-20 05:06:25	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: they still have the larger market share~
2016-02-20 05:07:02	+cookiemon5ter	shingetsu: idk much about how it works, but i have heard a lot of complaints about getting it to work
2016-02-20 05:07:04	+FrostFeline	Yes, and it still costs nothing to put the linux penguin(which is half the size of the steam one) :)
2016-02-20 05:07:31	+FrostFeline	Also if you're using a non-ubuntu, non-steamos distro, have fun managing library ABIs.

2016-02-20 05:18:07	+Smiley	hmmm
2016-02-20 05:18:07	+cookiemon5ter	you guys know what is funny? i just sold this on ebay http://www.ebay.com/itm/272135395713?ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1559.l2649
2016-02-20 05:18:10	+Smiley	i like being busy
2016-02-20 05:18:14	+Smiley	so any not busy time, -> bored time
2016-02-20 05:18:30	+shingetsu	iamben: yes, but the words used define the phenomenological frame through their perceived meanings and thus the wording matters
2016-02-20 05:18:44	+Smiley	arugh big words
2016-02-20 05:18:45	+shingetsu	Smiley: well that's you ;)
2016-02-20 05:18:48	+iamben	sometimes the words make you sound pretentious
2016-02-20 05:18:50	+Smiley	shingetsu: aye
2016-02-20 05:18:50	+cookiemon5ter	iamben: that's what arguing is

2016-02-20 05:19:21	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: I read the bit about steam trying to push their product by saying "hey, we support multiple platforms"
2016-02-20 05:19:31	+FrostFeline	That just seems like....
2016-02-20 05:19:41	+Smiley	that made arguements fun
2016-02-20 05:19:46	+FrostFeline	Like if apple was a grocery shop
2016-02-20 05:19:48	+shingetsu	iamben: people are free to think I'm pretentious, if they take that seriously, don't approach it and then think that their seeming perception matters, then I don't particularly care about what they think on the subject
2016-02-20 05:20:06	+FrostFeline	and you bought a chocolate bar in the apple store
2016-02-20 05:20:13	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: steam is trying to push linux, and they're trying to take over linux's public image as they do this
2016-02-20 05:20:17	+FrostFeline	and the chocolate was shaped like an apple.
2016-02-20 05:20:21	+cookiemon5ter	shingetsu: you care enough to let us know you don't care
2016-02-20 05:20:24	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: as such, putting their own branding in place of a tux.... ;)
2016-02-20 05:20:39	+shingetsu	cookiemon5ter: eh? I'm generalizing in the above, you aren't on that list yet~ ;)

2016-02-20 05:21:20	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Wouldn't it make more sense then to put a "SteamOS" logo there instead of "Steamplay"?
2016-02-20 05:21:41	+cookiemon5ter	okay, enough is enough
2016-02-20 05:21:42	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: "SteamPlay" are the words next to the "SteamOS" logo. The logo is SteamOS, the word is SteamPlay

2016-02-20 05:22:42	+shingetsu	iamben: I'd use "smaller" words, but that would mean I'll need to use more of them, and I'd lose meaning in the process. For example, phenomenology is the philosophical study of experiences, and separation of mind/matter ("stuff" vs experienece), and the frame of said subject is the process in which you are capable of experiencing

2016-02-20 05:28:55	+shingetsu	iamben: the main problem with the whole "don't use big words" argument, is that the list of "big words" changes between people.

2016-02-20 05:33:31	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: the difference between gentoo and gentoo-mirror is that gentoo-mirror generates metadata and adds news items
2016-02-20 05:33:43	+cookiemon5ter	shingetsu: i just remember because that is when i got out of the navy
2016-02-20 05:33:51	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: I wanted to have a git repo for the tree when I do a fresh install (doesnt really happen anymore though) and git isnt included in the stage3. people have told me that I could use git from within the host environment and then once I get the tree I can just install it after
2016-02-20 05:33:52	+cookiemon5ter	shingetsu: and gentoo was a fun hobby
2016-02-20 05:33:57	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: I'll give this a shot, thanks
2016-02-20 05:34:44	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: I just do "cd /mnt/gentoo/var && git clone https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo portage", and define the stuff in repos.conf - I just don't sync until the install is done and I have git installed
2016-02-20 05:34:47	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: yea that's what I wanted.. now that you mentioned metadata, yea that was also broken when I tried it (eix couldnt update because of missing metadata), so that should def fix those issues
2016-02-20 05:34:57	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: do we need changelogs for any functionality? I believe they are just informational
2016-02-20 05:34:57	+shingetsu	cookiemon5ter: congrads \o/ your hobby is older than my memories :D

2016-02-20 05:37:03	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: yea I got it already
2016-02-20 05:37:09	+fearedbliss	thanks
2016-02-20 05:37:18	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: if you feel like switching just rm -rf wherever portdir is, rm your conf (or remove portdir from make.conf) and emaint sync -r gentoo
2016-02-20 05:37:54	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: oh yea I switched to the new stuff back in 2.2.16

2016-02-20 05:39:22	+FrostFeline	It'd be really nice if my display manager had a battery meter in it
2016-02-20 05:39:38	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: get a battery meter
2016-02-20 05:39:39	+doc235	i am trying to switch this laptop from my external monitor to the laptop screen, when i do it with kd settings i get a screen theat is spread across 2 screens
2016-02-20 05:39:58	+doc235	how can i get a regular laptop screen
2016-02-20 05:40:05	+cookiemon5ter	doc235: use xrandr
2016-02-20 05:40:14	+shingetsu	doc235: disconnect the external monitor (easiest), or xrandr
2016-02-20 05:40:17	+doc235	i don't know how
2016-02-20 05:40:29	+cookiemon5ter	is there not a way to disable it with whatever kde has to offer
2016-02-20 05:40:43	+cookiemon5ter	xfce has a disable this monitor radio button
2016-02-20 05:40:51	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: I mean the battery in my laptop.
2016-02-20 05:40:52	+shingetsu	cookiemon5ter: there is a "disable" button, yes
2016-02-20 05:40:53	+doc235	disconnect doesn't work shingetsu it gives me the huge screen (lower right quadrant) on the laptop
2016-02-20 05:40:56	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: yes. So get one.
2016-02-20 05:41:01	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: I can always start kde and lock the screen
2016-02-20 05:41:06	+shingetsu	there are many available that are not tied to your DE
2016-02-20 05:41:12	+cookiemon5ter	doc235: unplug it and relog
2016-02-20 05:41:25	+cookiemon5ter	X should fix the rest
2016-02-20 05:41:55	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: http://sprunge.us/gGeH < output of "eix battery", should get you started ;)
2016-02-20 05:42:12	+doc235	ok got it
2016-02-20 05:42:25	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: a search of "eix power" should give more results, but will also give some false positives~
2016-02-20 05:42:28	+FrostFeline	shingetsu: Those can be used in the display manager?
2016-02-20 05:43:03	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: you never said what "Display Manager" you use, or anything about it. Those can be used inside X. Display Managers typically run on X.
2016-02-20 05:43:50	+shingetsu	for example, I do believe sddm has a built-in one
2016-02-20 05:44:04	+FrostFeline	I'm reading the manpage for sddm.conf now
2016-02-20 05:46:03	+doc235	i borrowed a psu to test the mobo iamben sent me and it post's so i am happy. just need to install and get a new psu for it
2016-02-20 05:47:54	+shingetsu	FrostFeline: my sddm looks like this: http://static.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/display_managers_finale/breeze_login_screen.png

2016-02-20 05:49:33	+FrostFeline	Now I've got the kernel reporting usb overcurrent
2016-02-20 05:49:47	+FrostFeline	With no usb devices plugged in... ruh roh
2016-02-20 05:50:45	+shingetsu	:^)
2016-02-20 05:51:44	+FrostFeline	Now I've got a bunch of port resume errors
2016-02-20 05:51:44		[05:51]
2016-02-20 05:51:49	+FrostFeline	I think this chromebook is fried.
2016-02-20 05:51:58	+FrostFeline	It still "works" though
2016-02-20 05:52:19	+FrostFeline	When there's an X gui to obscure the garbage being spat out by the kernel
2016-02-20 05:52:58	+FrostFeline	Maybe I'll disable ehci >>
2016-02-20 05:53:52	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: so I'm speaking in the gentoo dev channel, apparently gentoo-mirror github repo is controlled by mgorny and it isnt maintained by gentoo
2016-02-20 05:54:02	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: well, no, but so what?
2016-02-20 05:54:06	+cookiemon5ter	FrostFeline: wanna buy a netbook?
2016-02-20 05:54:17	+shingetsu	it's a bot that's pulling from the official repo, so does it really matter?
2016-02-20 05:54:21	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: this is important.. maybe not for you, but for me it is
2016-02-20 05:54:22	+FrostFeline	I'm poor right now.
2016-02-20 05:54:47	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: you can clone the official repo and have a postsync hook to generate metadata
2016-02-20 05:54:47	eroen	implying you think this will change?
2016-02-20 05:54:51	+shingetsu	that'll work just as well~
2016-02-20 05:54:52	+FrostFeline	besides, I'd rather just blacklist the faulty USB controller.
2016-02-20 05:54:55	+shingetsu	(though less convenient)
2016-02-20 05:55:04	+FrostFeline	I don't really need USB on this chromebook hue hue
2016-02-20 05:55:29	+shingetsu	peripherals? who needs'em
2016-02-20 05:55:39	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: yea def, I just am trying to figure out how something this logical isnt maintained by gentoo
2016-02-20 05:55:45	+shingetsu	I only need the stuff my southbridge links to directly!
2016-02-20 05:55:52	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: because no one cared enough to do it
2016-02-20 05:55:55	+fearedbliss	it would not be difficult to provide - contents between rsync and git in two diff protocols
2016-02-20 05:56:08	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: gentoo devs are currently struggling to move to git from CVS ;)
2016-02-20 05:57:19	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: lol we already moved..
2016-02-20 05:57:50	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: last I heard ( a few months ago ) a lot of people were very grumpy about it
2016-02-20 05:58:12	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: yea it isnt perfect but it depends which parts people are grumpy with I suppose
2016-02-20 05:58:19	+fearedbliss	things like no news/metadata is a big thing
2016-02-20 05:59:19	+FrostFeline	for some strange reason I had the urge to install networkmanager on my fileserver.
2016-02-20 05:59:23	+FrostFeline	o.o
2016-02-20 05:59:39	+FrostFeline	I configured it without really thinking about it.
2016-02-20 05:59:42	jaake	that's weird FrostFeline, stop it
2016-02-20 05:59:52	jaake	:)
2016-02-20 05:59:56	+FrostFeline	I mean it works....
2016-02-20 06:00:05	jaake	but why did you need it?
2016-02-20 06:00:06	+FrostFeline	It's just an extra package I don't really need
2016-02-20 06:00:22	+FrostFeline	I don't it's on a static ethernet connection.
2016-02-20 06:00:27	jaake	I need to clean up my gentoo box
2016-02-20 06:00:29	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: why don't *you* maintain it? ;)
2016-02-20 06:00:34	+FrostFeline	That's configured to get it's IP over DHCP
2016-02-20 06:00:37	+shingetsu	just talk to mgorny and get a copy of the bot~
2016-02-20 06:00:39	jaake	I am thinking of switching from hardened back to stock
2016-02-20 06:00:43	jaake	thoughtS?
2016-02-20 06:01:05	jaake	ever since GRsecurity patches are now unofficial or w/e I have been thinking about it.
2016-02-20 06:01:07	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: I'm not part of gentoo infra and it would defeat exactly what I'm advocating against..
2016-02-20 06:01:21	+fearedbliss	I said it should be part of gentoo infra, it shouldnt be 1 developers responsability
2016-02-20 06:01:22	+shingetsu	you're a contributor so fairly close tho
2016-02-20 06:01:54	+shingetsu	fearedbliss: why exactly does it need to be maintained by gentoo for you, btw? Because if it isn't related to actually using it, you can clone the mirror for personal use, and then you can have a non-auto-syncing copy elsewhere, that you use for patches/testing etc
2016-02-20 06:02:26	+fearedbliss	shingetsu: you are missing the bigger picture.. this isnt something about being maintained "for me"
2016-02-20 06:02:29	+iamben	this mostly all stems from the assumption that gentoo development moving from cvs to git means that users should move from rsync to git at the same time
2016-02-20 06:02:40	+fearedbliss	it's that the rsync tree is provided in completeness, and we now provide the gentoo tree through git but it isn't complete
2016-02-20 06:02:45	+iamben	the rsync to git thing is a separate project on a separate timeline iwth separate goals
2016-02-20 06:02:53	+fearedbliss	so now we have a seperate git tree that is being "completed" outside of the gentoo project by 1 developer
2016-02-20 06:03:04	+iamben	it's not on gentoo infra because it hasn't gotten there yet
2016-02-20 06:03:15	+cookiemon5ter	isn'
2016-02-20 06:03:21	+cookiemon5ter	isn't that a funtoo thing
2016-02-20 06:03:47	+fearedbliss	iamben: I'm speaking in gentoo-dev atm, there is duplicate responses that I am doing so I'll just keep it over there
2016-02-20 06:03:56	+fearedbliss	speaking to mgorny atm
2016-02-20 06:04:06	+iamben	yes i see it there
2016-02-20 06:04:49	jaake	is anyone else in here on hardened?
2016-02-20 06:05:34	+FrostFeline	yay, managed to kill the usb host controller
2016-02-20 06:06:36	+shingetsu	rip
2016-02-20 06:07:00	+FrostFeline	nothing appears to be disabled...

2016-02-20 06:14:54	+FrostFeline	Hm....
2016-02-20 06:15:47	+FrostFeline	Is there any point to having both ehci_pci and xhci_pci loaded?

2016-02-20 06:22:59	shingetsu	probably an old version where they didn't patch the code out
2016-02-20 06:23:06	shingetsu	even if you did try to use it, you wouldn't connect to anything
2016-02-20 06:23:16	shingetsu	or you'd connect to skype (though then microsoft would get mad)
2016-02-20 06:23:57	+doc235	got it iamben. bios change from OS to BIOS worked
2016-02-20 06:24:08	+doc235	on usb devices

2016-02-20 06:24:29	+iamben	at that stage in the boot process, the "OS" is lilo which i guess cannot handle usb itself

2016-02-20 07:17:07	adeel	stupid freaking perl...why do you want 5.20 when 5.22 is already installed?
2016-02-20 07:17:34	+likewhoa	adeel: because of 4.20 of course
2016-02-20 07:17:40	adeel	of course
2016-02-20 07:17:47	adeel	that's a better answer than what emerge is spitting out
2016-02-20 07:18:27	adeel	i just need to wait for emerge -avt to spit out whats asking for all these stupid virtual/perl-* modules
2016-02-20 07:18:50	jaake	iamben: are you using systemd?
2016-02-20 07:18:56	+iamben	if you get partway through a perl upgrade, where some stuff was already built for 5.22 but some parts didnt get rebuilt so are still "tied" to 5.20, emerge gets angy
2016-02-20 07:19:17	+iamben	jaake: yeah and it mostly works well, though once in a while i run across something with a missing or buggy service file

2016-02-20 07:20:30	+iamben	jaake: if you are going to go systemd, you need to go all in, set USE=systemd globally and rebuild ALL affected pkgs.  if anything is still built with -systemd then you may see conflicts

2016-02-20 07:20:59	jaake	:)
2016-02-20 07:21:24	+iamben	jaake: basically after setting a systemd profile, you need to "emerge -uDNav @world" asap, before trying to install anythign new
2016-02-20 07:21:32	shingetsu	jaake: if you just dislike sysvinit or openrc, consider using runit \o/
2016-02-20 07:21:35	+iamben	adeel: only because it hasnt been rebuilt for 5.22 yet
2016-02-20 07:21:46	+doc234	shingetsu: that did not work. it still says /mnt/gentoo is busy
2016-02-20 07:21:51	+iamben	adeel: anything which was originally built for 5.20 is going to claim to "need" it, due to subslot operator deps
2016-02-20 07:22:01	shingetsu	doc234: well you also have to umount -l /mnt/gentoo
2016-02-20 07:22:03	+iamben	doc234: honestly reboot may be faster

2016-02-20 07:22:21	adeel	iamben: even when i try just doing a simple 'emerge -avq1 git' after unmasking to the latest, it still tries to pull in perl-5.20 (even though 5.20 is completely gone from my system)
2016-02-20 07:22:23	*	scones dusts himself off.
2016-02-20 07:22:30	adeel	i think i just need to emerge git without perl once, and see if that fixes it

2016-02-20 07:23:00	+iamben	adeel: because some of its deps probably still want 5.20 also and they aren't being pulled into the dep graph

2016-02-20 07:24:45	shingetsu	that's why I wanted him to specify what he means by "clear"
2016-02-20 07:24:50	scones	Did there used to be a version of emerge --sync but was like emerge --websync?  I'm aware of emerge-webrsync, but that's the whole tree and not just updates.
2016-02-20 07:24:54	+iamben	adeel: are you fully up to date with "emerge -uDNav world" or are you onlhy partly upgraded?
2016-02-20 07:24:56	shingetsu	because just deleting all the files - mkfs is the best way
2016-02-20 07:24:57	dugz	oh totally clear would be dd id=/dev/zero ...
2016-02-20 07:25:02	shingetsu	yeah
2016-02-20 07:25:05	shingetsu	but he might not want that
2016-02-20 07:25:10	shingetsu	THUS why I asked him to specify dugz ......
2016-02-20 07:25:10	+iamben	scones: you mean delta webrsync?
2016-02-20 07:25:21	adeel	iamben: partially upgraded...this stupid perl thing has been blocking the world upgrade (i haven't updated this box in like 2 years)
2016-02-20 07:25:24	scones	iamben: Sounds like what I'd be interested in.
2016-02-20 07:25:50	+iamben	adeel: since your part-way through a perl upgrade and it's interrupted, i'd recommend using "--ignore-built-slot-operator-deps=y"
2016-02-20 07:25:54	shingetsu	"clear" might mean "no visible files" (dotfiles are fine), it might mean no files, it might mean clean journal, it might mean no data, etc
2016-02-20 07:26:20	scones	iamben: Is that the command?
2016-02-20 07:26:22	adeel	iamben: ooo...didn't even know about that option
2016-02-20 07:26:26	+iamben	adeel: the subslot operators are meant to force rebuilds of all perl consumers when perl bumps from 5.20 to 5.22, but if you only get half of them upgraded before emerge dies, then you're in an inconsistent state and emerge is nearly unusable
2016-02-20 07:26:49	+iamben	adeel: that will temporarily disable the sublot check, and you can get upgraded then clean up the remaining 5.20 stuff via perl-cleaner --all
2016-02-20 07:26:57	shingetsu	it's new with EAPI5, isn't it iamben?
2016-02-20 07:27:02	shingetsu	does git actually use that
2016-02-20 07:27:06	+iamben	scones: i dont know of delta webrsync images are being maintained anymore, tbh
2016-02-20 07:27:13	shingetsu	then again if it's pulling 5.20.... it might
2016-02-20 07:27:25	scones	iamben: Ahh.  Ok.
2016-02-20 07:27:35	adeel	i just did a quick 'USE=-perl emerge -avq1 git' and it seems to have gotten around the slot issue....for the time being
2016-02-20 07:27:41	+iamben	shingetsu: yeah it's an eapi5 feature
2016-02-20 07:28:16	+iamben	scones: i guess "emerge emerge-delta-webrsync" and try it and see?

2016-02-20 07:35:29	+iamben	adeel: at least some of these conflicts are because you are using unstable perl-5.22 with stable perl virtuals

2016-02-20 07:39:26	dugz	git-gud(1) should replace all perl scripts with python

2016-02-20 07:40:20	shingetsu	dugz: so what you're saying is, git-gud(1) should go through /usr/bin and edit git to run git-py$1 instead of git-$1? :^)
2016-02-20 07:40:22	@Griz64	mmmmmm. new ff-bin.
2016-02-20 07:40:22	+cookiemon5ter	unless you're just memorizing stuff for fun i suppose
2016-02-20 07:40:39	dugz	shingetsu, thats my proposition

2016-02-20 07:42:21	shingetsu	D:
2016-02-20 07:42:25	dugz	i have used git to clone source trees i think, kind of like an rsync. never to commit anything
2016-02-20 07:42:39	shingetsu	well, if that's your use case, go for it ;)
2016-02-20 07:42:54	shingetsu	seriously tho, feel free to ask me for help (though, only when I'm at home, aka not on this nick)
2016-02-20 07:42:58	+hosler	how can i tell if im using the cpu efficiently or making it thrash. wouldnt both show cpu at 100%?
2016-02-20 07:43:26	dugz	run the OS in valgrind?
2016-02-20 07:43:39	shingetsu	hosler: if you're thrashing a couple of processes (equal to number of logical cores) will be at 100, if you're using it effectively then it's super spread out

2016-02-20 07:46:52	+iamben	hosler: you can watch load avg, ideally it should be right at your cpu/core count  (this is simplifying a bit, but a good general rule)
2016-02-20 07:47:27	+iamben	if you go higher, your cpu has a "backlog" and bouncing between jobs, if it's lower than you're not using the full cpu potential
2016-02-20 07:47:39	dugz	i converted one of my debugging VMs to systemd yesterday for something to do. it works. systemd-cron is in a broken state on portage though

2016-02-20 07:50:58	+hosler	i use mobaxterm for ssh on windows. it comes packaged with cygwin i think

2016-02-20 07:51:03	+Cheaterman	it's a different thing

2016-02-20 07:51:10	+hosler	or i mean cygwin comes packaged with mobaxterm
2016-02-20 07:51:34	+Cheaterman	shingetsu: anything you build from a cygwin env is tied to cygwin because posix compat
2016-02-20 07:51:39	dugz	you can run x11 programs over cygwin ssh on windows if you have the whole xorg installed
2016-02-20 07:51:44	shingetsu	Cheaterman: nope, git gud
2016-02-20 07:51:50	+Cheaterman	while msys uses mingw, trying to compile a real windows binary without posix compat
2016-02-20 07:51:56	shingetsu	Cheaterman: still wrong
2016-02-20 07:52:38	shingetsu	Cheaterman: cygwin has gcc and it has mingw. gcc will compile against cygwin.dll, mingw on cygwin is a cross compiler to windows native. Same on msys, except it defaults to mingw.

2016-02-20 08:04:23	+hosler	ill just trust a reputable company
2016-02-20 08:04:25	shingetsu	dugz: it was -46C here last week
2016-02-20 08:04:30	eroen	D:
2016-02-20 08:04:31	shingetsu	hosler: ask wolfram alpha
2016-02-20 08:04:35	dugz	thats cold
2016-02-20 08:04:36	+hosler	google works
2016-02-20 08:04:40	shingetsu	which is better at math than google
2016-02-20 08:04:59	shingetsu	you can't trust something that does barrel rolls regularly with math :^)
2016-02-20 08:05:04	eroen	sad thing is wolfram is even worse at html than google :c
2016-02-20 08:05:17	shingetsu	at html, sure
2016-02-20 08:05:18	+doc234	what is the make option to pull in all drivers? make local? or something
2016-02-20 08:05:21	shingetsu	but they're better at math
2016-02-20 08:05:27	adeel	shingetsu: where the hell do you live where it got to -46C? iceland?
2016-02-20 08:05:31	shingetsu	adeel: Canada
2016-02-20 08:05:37	shingetsu	close enough
2016-02-20 08:05:37	adeel	shingetsu: where in canada?
2016-02-20 08:05:38	eroen	but it is so hard to access their better math :/
2016-02-20 08:05:54	dugz	wolfram plotted (1/x)*e^(jx) for me, i was impressed
2016-02-20 08:05:59	adeel	shingetsu: i'm in the greater toronto area and it was like -15 the other night
2016-02-20 08:06:01	shingetsu	adeel: Montreal
2016-02-20 08:06:17	shingetsu	dugz: wolfram is preeeeeetty good at math
2016-02-20 08:06:29	+doc234	nobody?
2016-02-20 08:06:37	shingetsu	adeel: it was only -46 for like 6h, but still
2016-02-20 08:06:45	+iamben	doc234: you dont want all drivers, just do a proper manual config
2016-02-20 08:06:52	AsumFace	wolfram is kinda crap at interpreting though
2016-02-20 08:07:01	shingetsu	AsumFace: so is google ;)
2016-02-20 08:07:09	shingetsu	I mean come on, google thinks 0^0 = 1
2016-02-20 08:07:32	dugz	doc234, emerge @x11-module-rebuild   ?
2016-02-20 08:07:36	shingetsu	omg
2016-02-20 08:07:41	shingetsu	google's plot of x^0 is wrong
2016-02-20 08:07:42	shingetsu	no way
2016-02-20 08:08:12	AsumFace	google doesn't think i mean temperature when i write 32F*1.2V
2016-02-20 08:08:29	+Smiley	by 1.2Volts?!
2016-02-20 08:08:35	dugz	x⁰ should be pretty straightforward
2016-02-20 08:08:39	shingetsu	AsumFace: google doesn't think anything
2016-02-20 08:10:11	shingetsu	actually, their x^0 graph is correct, they won't "click" to 0
2016-02-20 08:10:11		[08:10]
2016-02-20 08:10:14	shingetsu	but they still claim 0^0 is 1
2016-02-20 08:10:16	shingetsu	r00d
2016-02-20 08:10:26	dugz	what about x^(-0)
2016-02-20 08:10:36	dugz	cuz negative zero!
2016-02-20 08:10:53	+iamben	why are you guys using a search engine instead of a calculator?
2016-02-20 08:10:54	shingetsu	psh
2016-02-20 08:11:03	shingetsu	iamben: to see whether google can into math or not
2016-02-20 08:11:04	shingetsu	:^)
2016-02-20 08:11:14	shingetsu	seriously though, 0^0 = 0/0 = undefined
2016-02-20 08:11:21	AsumFace	iamben: calculator can't calculate with units
2016-02-20 08:11:24	eroen	AsumFace: F is farad
2016-02-20 08:11:32	shingetsu	0/0 can be any number (sure, including 1), and thus it's undefined
2016-02-20 08:12:08	eroen	shingetsu: better apply l'hopital's rule :)
2016-02-20 08:12:24	dugz	lim x->0 of (x/x)
2016-02-20 08:12:39	shingetsu	no limit to be had
2016-02-20 08:12:46	eroen	no limits!
2016-02-20 08:12:55	shingetsu	we have a direct value
2016-02-20 08:13:04	shingetsu	that value just happens to be *everything*
2016-02-20 08:13:10	shingetsu	and that's not rigorous
2016-02-20 08:13:34	dugz	looks like answer would simply be 1 according to the limit
2016-02-20 08:13:43	shingetsu	if 0/0 = 1, then I can multiply that by 2. 2*0/0 = 2, oops, 0*2 = 0. so 0/0=2
2016-02-20 08:13:55	shingetsu	it *looks* that way, but it simply is not
2016-02-20 08:14:31	AsumFace	eroen: i have to explicitly tell wolfram that, and that's really annoying as it doesn't remember the setting when i change the expression (unless i write the full name of the unit)
2016-02-20 08:14:43	shingetsu	that's the thing with limits, they're not *equal*, they're just really close approximations
2016-02-20 08:14:56	shingetsu	5/inf is not equal to 0, but the limit of that is 0
2016-02-20 08:15:12	dugz	ahh yes
2016-02-20 08:15:24	shingetsu	(I don't do math so I don't know what 5/inf would actually be, my guess would be 5 epsilon)
2016-02-20 08:15:47	+hosler	1/inf is the smallest number in the universe
2016-02-20 08:15:51	shingetsu	in the case of 0/0, the limit converging to one just means that it COULD be 1, not that it is \o/
2016-02-20 08:15:53	dugz	you would take the limit as x→∞
2016-02-20 08:15:55	shingetsu	hosler: no it isn't
2016-02-20 08:15:59	+hosler	yah huh
2016-02-20 08:16:10	shingetsu	hosler: what about 0.5/inf
2016-02-20 08:16:15	+hosler	thats just dumb
2016-02-20 08:16:17	shingetsu	:^)
2016-02-20 08:16:36	+hosler	lulz wut abouts 1/inf/inf
2016-02-20 08:16:42	shingetsu	hyperreals are dumb too, rite? :^)
2016-02-20 08:16:44	+doc234	iamben this is lspci -kk https://bpaste.net/show/99bcb92b44f8 i don't see a driver for the dual port ethernet
2016-02-20 08:16:55	shingetsu	here's a cool trick
2016-02-20 08:17:17	+iamben	doc234: not sure why it shows up as "bridge" but forcedeth is the driver
2016-02-20 08:17:18	shingetsu	lim(x -> inf) 1/x is greater than epsilon which in turn is greater to 1/inf
2016-02-20 08:17:25	shingetsu	(I think? not sure I'm allowed to do that last part)
2016-02-20 08:17:30	+iamben	00:08.0 Bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP55 Ethernet (rev a2)  Kernel driver in use: forcedeth
2016-02-20 08:17:35	+doc234	ok thats what i thought

2016-02-20 08:18:06	+iamben	maybe has something to do with the NICs living on the mobo south bridge itself?
2016-02-20 08:18:21	+doc234	possibly
2016-02-20 08:18:50	dugz	shingetsu, the limit can be positive or negative inf depending which way you are coming from
2016-02-20 08:19:03	+doc234	well i thinki have the kernel configured. will see how this thing acts compileing with 8gig of ram
2016-02-20 08:19:55	dugz	doc234, my 16G ram just went through Shenzen Sort Facility ;)
2016-02-20 08:20:18	+iamben	doc234: so i guess that mobo likes the 8g mem you had, huh?
2016-02-20 08:20:30	+doc234	yes iamben, works great
2016-02-20 08:20:43	dugz	doc234, you should like 8G ram, esp if you use some tmpfs

2016-02-20 08:33:43	+doc234	i tested my old mobo with this psu and it would not post :/ so i figure the cpu died
2016-02-20 08:34:19	shingetsu	time for new cpu?
2016-02-20 08:34:41	+iamben	probably 15-20 mins for a manual build there
2016-02-20 08:35:00	+doc234	well i am not sure if it is the cpu or the mobo. but iamben sent me a dualcore mobo and my ram fit right in so i have 8gig of ram in it
2016-02-20 08:35:26	shingetsu	dual core.... mobo?
2016-02-20 08:35:29	shingetsu	with two sockets? :O
2016-02-20 08:35:35	+doc234	4
2016-02-20 08:35:40	shingetsu	0_0
2016-02-20 08:35:43	shingetsu	what's the socket?
2016-02-20 08:35:48	+doc234	no idea
2016-02-20 08:35:49	shingetsu	can you put a bunch of xeons in it?
2016-02-20 08:35:50	+iamben	it's just a single AM2 socket
2016-02-20 08:35:51	shingetsu	:D

2016-02-20 08:36:21	shingetsu	the cpu that's already in the mobo is a dual cor?
2016-02-20 08:36:24	+doc234	i am losty, hehehehe
2016-02-20 08:36:31	+doc234	took me a minute
2016-02-20 08:36:34	+iamben	it's an old athlo64 x2, yeah
2016-02-20 08:36:40	shingetsu	ok, that's very different
2016-02-20 08:37:02	shingetsu	not sure whether AM2 can into DDR3...
2016-02-20 08:37:12	shingetsu	but pretty sure any ram will fit right in into any mobo
2016-02-20 08:37:15	shingetsu	at least semi-modern ram
2016-02-20 08:37:49	+iamben	the sockets are different on ddr2/3/4
2016-02-20 08:37:56	+iamben	luckily he already had that 8GB ddr2
2016-02-20 08:38:23	shingetsu	yeah, but still
2016-02-20 08:38:29	shingetsu	any ddr2 should fit on any ddr2-capable mobo
2016-02-20 08:38:31	shingetsu	as far as I'm aware
2016-02-20 08:39:20	+iamben	might be a problem if your mobo/cpu wanted a certain higher freq mem and you had something old like pc2-4200? dunno
2016-02-20 08:39:32	+iamben	i know you can use faster ram for a slower mobo, dunno if the reverse is true
2016-02-20 08:40:07	shingetsu	well it'll "fit" either way
2016-02-20 08:40:30	shingetsu	in terms of clocks/freqs I'm not sure, but it should post either way, just spectacularly crash?
2016-02-20 08:40:38	shingetsu	I'm not very familiar with ddr2 for obvious reasons :/
2016-02-20 08:40:55	+doc234	older than you? :)

2016-02-20 08:46:03	shingetsu	thus apple has had nothing to do in the variation

2016-02-20 08:53:03	@Griz64	how do you restart usb on a ()buntu machine?
2016-02-20 08:53:10	shingetsu	Griz64: define restart usb
2016-02-20 08:53:25	eroen	last time I compared on a box, qtwebkit built in 20 minutes while webkit-gtk took 7 hours
2016-02-20 08:53:28	@Griz64	shingetsu, suddenly, his mouse/kbd/anything USB does not work.
2016-02-20 08:53:40	shingetsu	Griz64: sounds like evdev died
2016-02-20 08:53:45	+FrostFeline	Griz64: rmmod ehci-pci?
2016-02-20 08:54:05	shingetsu	is the screen moving/updating?
2016-02-20 08:54:06	dugz	Griz64, i just unplug whatever hub and replug it
2016-02-20 08:54:14	+hosler	the good ole in out
2016-02-20 08:54:16	+Tear	strange, they take more or less the same time for me
2016-02-20 08:54:17	@Griz64	dugz, no joy
2016-02-20 08:54:24	+FrostFeline	You can't unplug the hub if it's soldered to your PCI bus
2016-02-20 08:54:25	+FrostFeline	:P
2016-02-20 08:54:36	shingetsu	Tear: what version of qtwebkit?
2016-02-20 08:55:05	shingetsu	Tear: also, do you have your CPU_FLAGS_X86 defined?
2016-02-20 08:55:07	+Tear	whatever qupzilla pulls in by default
2016-02-20 08:55:09	+Tear	and yes
2016-02-20 08:55:10	dugz	i've seen that when a machine had ehci and ohci both and the wrong driver took control
2016-02-20 08:55:45	shingetsu	Tear: qupzilla has no default, it supports qt4 and qt5, and your settings determine what it pulls
2016-02-20 08:56:00	+Tear	qt5 probably
2016-02-20 08:56:20	shingetsu	Tear: qt4 qtwebkit takes much longer to compile than qt5 qtwebkit due to their old organization being monolithic, meaning that parts of qt proper are being built along with it
2016-02-20 08:56:26	shingetsu	Tear: "probably"
2016-02-20 08:56:41	+Tear	omg i don't exactly memorize flags of everything i have
2016-02-20 08:56:50	shingetsu	Tear: "equery u qupzilla"
2016-02-20 08:56:56	+Tear	i don't even have it anymore
2016-02-20 08:56:58	shingetsu	it takes under 10 seconds to find out exactly
2016-02-20 08:57:02	shingetsu	so?
2016-02-20 08:57:03	 < 	blueness (~blueness@gentoo/developer/blueness) has quit (Quit: blueness)

2016-02-20 08:57:21	@Griz64	dugz, all that's showing is ahci
2016-02-20 08:57:44	+Tear	it was long ago and a lot has changed on my system
2016-02-20 08:58:02	+hosler	Griz64: does lsusb still show stuff

2016-02-20 08:59:05	+iamben	but i think this is a venison tenderloin..
2016-02-20 08:59:15	eroen	oh neato
2016-02-20 08:59:23	shingetsu	"long time ago" and qt5 don't fit well together
2016-02-20 08:59:34	+hosler	why not
2016-02-20 08:59:42	shingetsu	and "long time ago" and having clear and concise memories of how long thing X took compared to Y also don't fit well together
2016-02-20 08:59:46	shingetsu	hosler: qt5 is relatively recent
2016-02-20 08:59:49	+hosler	how recent
2016-02-20 08:59:51	shingetsu	I actually remember it becoming a thing ;)
2016-02-20 08:59:54	eroen	couple years
2016-02-20 09:00:00	@Griz64	hosler, some things. trying to get a clarification.
2016-02-20 09:00:14	shingetsu	It started getting big like a year and a half ish ago?
2016-02-20 09:00:21	shingetsu	5.2 got stabilized I think
2016-02-20 09:00:44	+hosler	qt5 came around in 2012
2016-02-20 09:00:52	+Tear	anyway i don't use qupzilla because it locked up completely on image galleries like imgur and dropbox
2016-02-20 09:00:58	eroen	qt5 got added to gentoo /years/ after other mainstream distros relied on it :P
2016-02-20 09:01:08	*	shingetsu nods

2016-02-20 09:01:43	eroen	I think maybe I go sleep in 10 minutes
2016-02-20 09:01:52	_anomaly_	if you're looking at it that closely i think you need to change jobs
2016-02-20 09:01:52	+iamben	hosler: so it looks like you're waiting for 5:00 and shingetsu is waiting for 4:20..
2016-02-20 09:01:53	_anomaly_	;)
2016-02-20 09:01:54	+hosler	_anomaly_: if i stare at it hard enough i cam make it change

2016-02-20 09:03:32	eroen	I'm pretty sure boobs are a constant thing, not for a specific time
2016-02-20 09:03:41	+hosler	boobs grow over time
2016-02-20 09:03:53	eroen	true, but not on hour scales

2016-02-20 09:05:10	eroen	In general, I prefer ladies with pilot licences over ladies with surgical enhancements.
2016-02-20 09:05:19	+hosler	what about both
2016-02-20 09:05:20	shingetsu	pilot licenses? :O
2016-02-20 09:05:33	eroen	shingetsu: I'm told the cost is pretty similar
2016-02-20 09:05:40	shingetsu	:o ~
2016-02-20 09:06:10	+hosler	but enhancements might lead to free lessons

2016-02-20 11:16:42	Viperlin	ext4 - add discard to mount options
2016-02-20 11:17:32	dia	Viperlin, thats it?
2016-02-20 11:17:48	SpaceToast	there are a few other things you can do dia, but I'm too tired right now
2016-02-20 11:17:49	Viperlin	check it's working?
2016-02-20 11:17:51	SpaceToast	ask again tomorrow :)
2016-02-20 11:18:15	Viperlin	a lot of suggestions are out of date or based on theory rather than current tested ssd lifetimes
2016-02-20 11:18:26	Viperlin	they are in fact quite robust
2016-02-20 11:18:30	dia	Viperlin, I don't know anything about Trim, and everything i read is from like 2013
2016-02-20 11:18:55	Viperlin	enable discard - do small test (google) to check it's working. that's about it for linux+trim
2016-02-20 11:19:10	dia	Viperlin, OK awesome.

2016-02-20 22:22:45	mystica555_	bad memory? bad psu finally giving up its ghost?
2016-02-20 22:22:56	mystica555_	compiled the kernel for an amd but put it in an intel?
2016-02-20 22:23:04	mystica555_	(or vice versa)
2016-02-20 22:25:39	+doc234	mystica555_: good mobo, good psu, kernel panic says can't find root fs unknown_root(8,0)
2016-02-20 22:26:57	Juippis	and on which sdX drive is your installation?
2016-02-20 22:27:00	Juippis	check grub config?
2016-02-20 22:27:42	+doc234	i musing sda3 aa root i have a 1TB drive. and i use lilo not grub
2016-02-20 22:28:26	Juippis	well, I think in grub config sda3 would be something like 0,2
2016-02-20 22:28:35	+doc234	i just reconfigured the kernel. will try again once it gets done
2016-02-20 22:28:47	Juippis	but to me it sounds like bootloader issue
2016-02-20 22:28:56	+doc234	Juippis: hmmmmm interesting. maybe i need to specify it
2016-02-20 22:29:22	mystica555_	ok; you may have somehow changed the drive that boots in your BIOS so somehow its making not sda but perhaps a different disk; what i like to do is GPT and PARTUUID in my root= line for the kernel
2016-02-20 22:30:16	mystica555_	(and, lilo really doesnt care about gpt or not, it sits in the mbr which is irrespective of os-capable partitioning schema; it just has a list of blocks on-disk to load)
2016-02-20 22:30:16		[22:30]
2016-02-20 22:31:21	+doc234	yep
2016-02-20 22:31:39	+doc234	the drive works, it was in this box originaly
2016-02-20 22:31:56	+doc234	new motherboard, clean install
2016-02-20 22:31:58	mystica555_	i didnt say it didnt work; i said somehow drive order is different perhaps between bios and os
2016-02-20 22:32:19	mystica555_	if you had an old motherboard, it may have been a different disk according to bios
2016-02-20 22:32:25	+doc234	i understood :) just giving details
2016-02-20 22:32:27	mystica555_	:)
2016-02-20 22:32:39	mystica555_	its probably called /dev/sdd now
2016-02-20 22:33:06	+doc234	iamben sent me the mobo and he tested it. but it has wierd stuff
2016-02-20 22:33:08	mystica555_	do you use an initrd thats able to parse filesystem UUIDs?
2016-02-20 22:33:29	+doc234	no it is /dev/sda1,sda2(swap),sda3
2016-02-20 22:33:35	+doc234	no initrd
2016-02-20 22:33:56	mystica555_	then convert your partitions to GPT and use root=PARTUUID=the partition's unique id
2016-02-20 22:34:05	mystica555_	sysrescuecd / gdisk can do this
2016-02-20 22:34:16	+doc234	i am using systemrescuecd
2016-02-20 22:34:18	dugz	do you have /dev/sda3 set as bootable?

2016-02-20 22:35:58	mystica555_	might not need gpt for it to work
2016-02-20 22:36:19	mystica555_	just copy the whole bit between ""s of PARTUUID= into your root= line
2016-02-20 22:36:39	mystica555_	root=PARTUUID=15ea6b36-03   (literally 2 equalssigns)

2016-02-20 22:38:01	mystica555_	dugz: only if your initrd parses the uuid= bit
2016-02-20 22:38:11	mystica555_	the kernel cannot parse filesystem uuids oddly; just partition ones
2016-02-20 22:38:38	mystica555_	i guess the logic to mount ALL THE FILESYSTEM DRIVERS just to read the rootfs is a bit much

2016-02-20 22:40:29	+Cheaterman	doc234: doesn't sound too good to me
2016-02-20 22:40:33	dugz	that looks wrong
2016-02-20 22:40:37	+Cheaterman	yep
2016-02-20 22:40:52	+doc234	hmmmmm
2016-02-20 22:41:01	+Cheaterman	doc234: remove all the UUID cruft, /dev/sda3 does the trick. if you wanna recognize your part by UUID, then you should probably remove /dev/sda3
2016-02-20 22:41:02	+doc234	root = UUID="33c29661-c58a-4223-b8fe-b694287eb851" this is what i have in my lilo.conf
2016-02-20 22:41:05	+Cheaterman	and that should be about it I think
2016-02-20 22:41:06	+doc234	maybe?
2016-02-20 22:41:10	+Cheaterman	doc234: that should be better yes
2016-02-20 22:41:50	+doc234	cheaterman no /dev/sda3 is what it is, but it won't boot. kernel panic can't find root fs
2016-02-20 22:42:04	+Cheaterman	doc234: even with simply /dev/sda3 ?
2016-02-20 22:42:08	+doc234	yes
2016-02-20 22:42:15	+Cheaterman	without all the UUID cruft? Hmm... weird
2016-02-20 22:42:32	Juippis	isnt that UUID only needed if your BIOS rearranges the drives?
2016-02-20 22:42:37	+Cheaterman	Juippis: yes
2016-02-20 22:42:40	Juippis	yea
2016-02-20 22:42:46	+Cheaterman	but that doesn't explain why he can't boot with a normal block dev
2016-02-20 22:42:49	dugz	is it popping up as hda1?
2016-02-20 22:42:50	Phr33d0m	is it normal that `sysctl -p` ignores /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf ?
2016-02-20 22:42:56	Juippis	so if you booted a live USB would it show sda somewhere different?
2016-02-20 22:43:10	+doc234	no dugz
2016-02-20 22:43:16	+Cheaterman	dugz: that's a goner for like 10 years now
2016-02-20 22:43:18	SkunkyFone	is it saying unknown block 0,0, or unknown block 8,3?
2016-02-20 22:43:36	Juippis	it said 8,0 in my opinion
2016-02-20 22:43:43	Juippis	which is like... sdh1?
2016-02-20 22:43:47	+doc234	yes SkunkyFone it IS
2016-02-20 22:43:49	SkunkyFone	sda1
2016-02-20 22:43:57	+doc234	block(8,0)
2016-02-20 22:43:58	SkunkyFone	Juippis: 8,0 is sda1
2016-02-20 22:44:08	+Cheaterman	why
2016-02-20 22:44:28	SkunkyFone	because block device 8 is scsi, and 0 is the first partition in the first scsi device
2016-02-20 22:44:47	+doc234	i am not using scsi that i know of :/
2016-02-20 22:44:54	+Cheaterman	why would block device 8 be the first scsi disk
2016-02-20 22:44:54	SkunkyFone	0,0 means it didn't find your hard drive.  8,0 means you either told it sda1, or it can't figure out your partition table
2016-02-20 22:45:06	+Cheaterman	o__O okay, weird
2016-02-20 22:45:15	SkunkyFone	Cheaterman: because that's how it is :)

2016-02-20 22:45:43	Juippis	SkunkyFone: what would 1,0 be then?
2016-02-20 22:45:47	Juippis	sda as well?
2016-02-20 22:45:58	+Cheaterman	floppy! :D
2016-02-20 22:46:01	SkunkyFone	Juippis: no
2016-02-20 22:46:25	dugz	doc234 you do have scsi drive support compiled in right? it's required
2016-02-20 22:46:42	SkunkyFone	Juippis: 1,0 is ramdisk 0

2016-02-20 22:52:41	mystica555_	and make sure you had all the modules therE?

2016-02-20 22:53:18	dugz	so (8,3) would be sda3 ?
2016-02-20 22:53:24	doc235	yea
2016-02-20 22:53:34	+Cheaterman	yes dugz that seems to make sense
2016-02-20 22:53:42	+Cheaterman	from what SkunkyFone explained earlier

2016-02-20 22:54:11	+Cheaterman	or if modules are you sure they're in initramfs
2016-02-20 22:54:22	+Cheaterman	dugz: I suppose
2016-02-20 22:54:26	mystica555_	actually lspci is the one im thinking of
2016-02-20 22:54:29	doc235	yes Cheaterman , built in
2016-02-20 22:54:31	mystica555_	but lsmod is also useful to double check agianst

2016-02-20 22:55:27	doc235	dugz. ok but i have never run genkernel :)
2016-02-20 22:55:28	SkunkyFone	doc235: does it give a list of partitions that it did find, just above the kernel panic?
2016-02-20 22:55:59	doc235	not that i could see. of course it ran off the swcreen right quick
2016-02-20 22:56:07	dugz	emerge genkernel && genkernel all   would probably make a working kernel

2016-02-21 02:22:08	+doc235	ok now to figure out which it is :)
2016-02-21 02:22:15	+iamben	for testing purposes you could create a second lilo entry, ya know
2016-02-21 02:22:24	+iamben	leave the working one as-is, add one for the other kernel setup

2016-02-21 02:23:19	+iamben	i think your very first boot failure, that prompted you to try genkernel, was just because you were booting the old bzImage, and not the kernel you actually just built, vmlinuz-whatever

2016-02-21 02:32:03	+iamben	your panic showed a root device of 8,3 which means /dev/sda3 did exist, i wonder if you were missing ext3 support in-kernel
2016-02-21 02:32:57	+doc235	checked that with othhers in #gentoo
2016-02-21 02:33:04	+iamben	it would have said 0,0 if it didnt exist at all

2016-02-21 02:52:51	+iamben	hard to know what to do here if we have no idea what the panic message sayd
2016-02-21 02:53:20	+doc235	ok let me get it up and type it the best i can
2016-02-21 02:53:40	+iamben	i wonder if this is a problem: CONFIG_EXT3_FS=m
2016-02-21 02:54:17	+iamben	you do have CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y which should make the built-in ext4 driver able to mount your ext3 rootfs, but maybe since you have the separate ext3_fs driver marked as module, the ext4 driver doesn't try to help?
2016-02-21 02:54:50	+iamben	probably should just disable CONFIG_EXT3_FS to be sure
2016-02-21 02:55:07	+doc235	ok i have the panic screen
2016-02-21 02:55:38	+doc235	unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(8,3)
2016-02-21 02:55:38		[02:55]
2016-02-21 02:57:26	+iamben	does it show "available partitions:" and are any listed?
2016-02-21 02:57:28	+doc235	iamben there is a bunch of hex stuff and then it syas calltrace and lists dump_stack, panic, mount_block_root, mount_root, prepare_namespace
2016-02-21 02:57:37	+iamben	does it say anything about unknown filesystem?
2016-02-21 02:57:57	+doc235	i have no interactive shell now :/

2016-02-21 02:59:44	+iamben	right, the interactive shell is provided by initramfs, your manual kernel doesnt have one
2016-02-21 02:59:56	+iamben	i think try disabling that EXT3_FS option and see if it helps
2016-02-21 03:00:11	+doc235	ok
2016-02-21 03:03:15	+iamben	at least you've got the working genkernel one so you can boot to that instead of using the livecd
2016-02-21 03:03:27	+doc235	one thing i know, i got the NIC drivers in right :)
2016-02-21 03:03:37	+doc235	still booting systemrescuecd
2016-02-21 03:04:29	+iamben	you should be able to do these new kernel builds/tests from your real gentoo if the genkernel kernel still works

2016-02-21 03:35:59	+iamben	jwm224: if wicd is broken, it's almost certainly due to external changes, not changes to wicd itself

2016-02-21 03:36:54	+doc234	ok
2016-02-21 03:38:15	+iamben	you have "Use ext4 for ext2/ext3 file systems" aka CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23, which makes EXT3_FS unneeded
2016-02-21 03:38:48	+doc234	ok, cool

2016-02-21 03:39:33	+iamben	wicd is a dead project and not keeping up with the changes going on around it

2016-02-21 03:41:37	redeyedman	surprisingly, nothing has fallen off after the update, even nvidia's blob builds fine
2016-02-21 03:42:21	+iamben	jwm224: i guess you could try to roll back wicd but the old one may not build, r2 adds some build fixes for lib changes
2016-02-21 03:42:27	+iamben	ideally you should drop wicd
2016-02-21 03:43:18	jwm224	iamben: you mean remove... drop? Then, re-add.

2016-02-21 08:05:23	wonko7	if I make a machine emerge sync & update in a cron everyday, are there tools for reporting when things don't work? (like send me an email saying that there a blockers or something)
2016-02-21 08:05:39	+iamben	automating the update is not safe

2016-02-21 08:05:58	+Griz64	or smart
2016-02-21 08:07:00	wonko7	even if I do a btrfs snapshot before updating?

2016-02-21 08:11:13	+Cheaterman	Reminds me of which
2016-02-21 08:15:11	+lejonet	wonko7: if you run a stable system, once or twice a month tops should be more than enough

2016-02-21 12:42:47	adeel_	yeah, i recall the history of scsi drives...but why not just make a super low-end drive, similar in performance to IDE, and just skip the stupid IDE/consumer standard?

2016-02-21 12:47:57	adeel_	i think in reality, all you're paying for with the reds is the extended warranty....but that works fo rme

2016-02-21 21:37:37	+xiaomiao	for a time emerging gentoo-sources spiked memory usage to >512MB because >25k files
2016-02-21 21:37:42	+xiaomiao	I can't even figure that one out
2016-02-21 21:38:04	+xiaomiao	that means each file took >=20kB in memory? HOW?!
2016-02-21 21:38:18	+xiaomiao	filename + permissions + ... is <1kB on average
2016-02-21 21:38:27	dugz	autotools are the slow little devils that nobody can tame
2016-02-21 21:38:39	+xiaomiao	fix *that* inefficiency and suddenly portage will be a tad faster
2016-02-21 21:40:54	dugz	i doubt that 1/10 of the stuff autotools checks for is ever even used

2016-02-22 10:42:04	hosler	i forbid you do use genkernel

2016-02-22 10:42:26	SpaceToast	chry: I managed to hit the post-paradox, where you do that, but you're still sorta productive
2016-02-22 10:42:32	+doc235	i need genkernel for the initram which seems to be the only way i can boot it

2016-02-22 10:42:40	chry	:D
2016-02-22 10:42:43	SpaceToast	why initramfs ;w;
2016-02-22 10:42:57	hosler	doc235: you dont need a genkernel kernel to make genkerlen initramfs
2016-02-22 10:43:02	SpaceToast	^
2016-02-22 10:43:04	+doc235	because all other ways to get it to boot failed
2016-02-22 10:43:07	hosler	also i hate initrramfs, but i wont tell you not to use it
2016-02-22 10:43:16	chry	SpaceToast, well, as long as you're productive...I don't mind...
2016-02-22 10:43:27	+doc235	i never used genkernel before the past 2 days
2016-02-22 10:43:40	hosler	dun start now
2016-02-22 10:43:45	_anomaly_	i don't get the polarising nature of the issue
2016-02-22 10:43:52	hosler	all genkernel ever did for me was make me confused
2016-02-22 10:43:55	_anomaly_	with, without, hand rolled, genkernel, it's all the same if you understand it
2016-02-22 10:44:35	_anomaly_	i have one machine that execs the kernel direct from efi with initrd literally cp'd to the end of the kernel image
2016-02-22 10:44:38	_anomaly_	ner
2016-02-22 10:44:39	+doc235	i understand it and my system needs an initram :)
2016-02-22 10:44:54	hosler	why you say this
2016-02-22 10:44:57	_anomaly_	thats a fun one to update too
2016-02-22 10:45:02	+doc235	i told you dammit

2016-02-22 10:45:23	+Cheaterman	xD
2016-02-22 10:45:24	+doc235	it won't boot without one
2016-02-22 10:45:34	hosler	it wont boot wihtout one because you compiled as modules
2016-02-22 10:45:42	_anomaly_	[m] ext4  -> [*] ext4
2016-02-22 10:45:43	hosler	because you used genkernel
2016-02-22 10:45:45	_anomaly_	problem fixed, doc235
2016-02-22 10:45:59	+doc235	i tried hand rolling and i could not get it to stop panicking

2016-02-22 10:46:40	_anomaly_	you can teach an old doc new tricks
2016-02-22 10:46:43	_anomaly_	just takes more effort

2016-02-22 10:46:45	hosler	he did menuconfig all
2016-02-22 10:46:56	hosler	doc235: gives you a sane setup
2016-02-22 10:47:00	SpaceToast	my approach: everything I KNOW I'll use should be built-in. If I don't think I'll use it, why am I getting it at all? Things that I have hardware for but probalby won't really use arre modules
2016-02-22 10:47:26	hosler	some stuff demands modules. like drivers that use firmware
2016-02-22 10:47:38	username234	doc235: well you see umm... the kernel uhh... and then the initramfs needs too... and that's how it all relates to startx
2016-02-22 10:48:03	chry	Owi, Cheaterman!
2016-02-22 10:48:03		[10:48]
2016-02-22 10:48:15	FrostFeline	Yeah that;s one approach.
2016-02-22 10:48:18	+Cheaterman	hosler: --menuconfig all → use menuconfig before make, make modules & kernel & initrd

2016-02-22 10:48:46	+Cheaterman	hosler: my point is "menuconfig all" doesn't mean he didn't use his config
2016-02-22 10:48:47	+doc235	anyway. i m tired
2016-02-22 10:48:52	+doc235	sleep time for me
2016-02-22 10:48:54	hosler	Cheaterman: ask him
2016-02-22 10:49:00	username234	doc235: lol.  glad I could help ;-P
2016-02-22 10:49:02	FrostFeline	If you wanted you could also use an initial ramdisk to load the appropiate modules, SpaceToast
2016-02-22 10:49:05	+doc235	:)
2016-02-22 10:49:12	+Cheaterman	owiii dokee have a good sleepisleepi ^__^
2016-02-22 10:49:17	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: ew >:
2016-02-22 10:49:24	SpaceToast	why tho
2016-02-22 10:49:33	FrostFeline	Is there some technical problem with using a ramdisk?
2016-02-22 10:49:44	hosler	doc235: one argument for not use genkernel is that it probably enabled framebuffers, which you dont want
2016-02-22 10:50:02	hosler	you want KMS
2016-02-22 10:50:26	FrostFeline	Wait, I thought framebuffers were a feature that KMS enabled?
2016-02-22 10:50:44	username234	FrostFeline: no.  Framebuffers actually came first.
2016-02-22 10:51:11	+Cheaterman	KMS just enables you to have a framebuffer without a fb driver like vesa
2016-02-22 10:51:19	+Cheaterman	because it speaks GPU
2016-02-22 10:51:27	+Cheaterman	(it → the kernel)
2016-02-22 10:51:44	FrostFeline	So what does a framebuffer have to do with vesa vs kms?
2016-02-22 10:51:52	+Cheaterman	no more vesa when you use kms
2016-02-22 10:52:10	FrostFeline	and genkernel enables vesa by default?
2016-02-22 10:52:30	 < 	djdunn (~djdunn@207.30.110.160) has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2016-02-22 10:52:32	FrostFeline	Would the kms driver for your card replace vesa when you load it?
2016-02-22 10:52:33	+Cheaterman	i don't know, I don't think it would re-enable it on a config that has it disabled
2016-02-22 10:52:34	tomboy64	lol
2016-02-22 10:52:43	tomboy64	"because it speaks GPU"
2016-02-22 10:52:45	tomboy64	cute <3
2016-02-22 10:52:46	+Cheaterman	tomboy64: :D
2016-02-22 10:52:50	+Cheaterman	Bliblibli ^__^
2016-02-22 10:52:51	_anomaly_	genkernel doesn't do anything by default, unless you use the default kernel config
2016-02-22 10:53:00	*	tomboy64 spanks Cheaterman
2016-02-22 10:53:00	username234	FrostFeline: I don't know about that.  Enabling FB drivers would be problematic as they can conflict with X11 drivers (such as nvidia-drivers)
2016-02-22 10:53:04	+Cheaterman	hahah
2016-02-22 10:53:05	tomboy64	u naughty
2016-02-22 10:53:31	FrostFeline	Cheaterman: there's no kms drivers for vesa?
2016-02-22 10:53:40	SpaceToast	vesa is too generic
2016-02-22 10:53:44	chry	doc235, you still here?
2016-02-22 10:53:45	FrostFeline	If you happen to have a gpu that just don't work
2016-02-22 10:53:48	+Cheaterman	vesa and kms are parellel things, and they can fight
2016-02-22 10:53:50	SpaceToast	:^)
2016-02-22 10:53:55	+Cheaterman	just don't have one if you use the other
2016-02-22 10:54:05	FrostFeline	Why hasn't someone made a vesa kms driver?
2016-02-22 10:54:12	+Cheaterman	because it doesn't make sense?
2016-02-22 10:54:19	_anomaly_	vesa is archaic and problematic on 64bit
2016-02-22 10:54:28	username234	FrostFeline: you typically don't switch resolutions when using VESA.
2016-02-22 10:54:58	FrostFeline	Can't vesa run at high resolutions like 1280x1024?
2016-02-22 10:54:59	chry	Why hasn't anyone made a radeonfb bootup penguin logo?
2016-02-22 10:55:12	username234	FrostFeline: depends on the Graphics card.
2016-02-22 10:55:23	hosler	sometimes my keyboard just stop working
2016-02-22 10:55:44	SpaceToast	hosler: what's your INPUT_DEVICES like?
2016-02-22 10:55:50	SpaceToast	and in what context does it happen
2016-02-22 10:55:51	hosler	like butter
2016-02-22 10:56:05	hosler	like when i type it dont do
2016-02-22 10:56:53	SpaceToast	type harder :^)
2016-02-22 10:57:11	_anomaly_	stop putting butter on your kb
2016-02-22 10:57:23	*	_anomaly_ shakes head
2016-02-22 10:57:49	username234	FrostFeline: put simply when using VESA, the card is queried for what modes it supports.  Often times, it's only a very small subset of what the card can really do.  Drivers that support KMS allow you to use any resolution the card can handle.
2016-02-22 10:58:13	FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Do you dislike initrd because there's some problem with it or it's just an extra step?
2016-02-22 10:58:20	_anomaly_	iirc vesa also requires i386 mode emulation, that vmm thingy that is annoying
2016-02-22 10:58:29	FrostFeline	genkernel initramfs doesn't seem like to much work.
2016-02-22 10:58:33	_anomaly_	gl using that on a biosless efi system too
2016-02-22 10:58:40	tomboy64	 Can't vesa run at high resolutions like 1280x1024? <--- you'd seriously consider that high-res these days? :-D
2016-02-22 10:58:44	username234	_anomaly_: I'm not sure about that.  I've used vesafb without installing v86d
2016-02-22 10:58:58	_anomaly_	username234: on a bios system i'm sure
2016-02-22 10:59:08	FrostFeline	tomboy64: Yes, 1280x1024 hasn't magically lost pixels in the last 10 years :)
2016-02-22 10:59:19	chry	Seriously, though, about that logo...
2016-02-22 10:59:23	username234	_anomaly_: oh yes.  I haven't tried, but it's my understanding *vesafb doesn't work on EFI systems.
2016-02-22 10:59:26	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: I dislike initrd because there's typically no reason to have one
2016-02-22 10:59:27	tomboy64	;)
2016-02-22 10:59:27	chry	I want one, right now... ;x
2016-02-22 10:59:44	tomboy64	chry: go install a buntu?
2016-02-22 10:59:46	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: imagine having a text editor for your text editor
2016-02-22 10:59:56	chry	A what?
2016-02-22 10:59:57	_anomaly_	username234: also i remember now, it's uvesafb that needed v86d
2016-02-22 10:59:58	chry	:D
2016-02-22 10:59:58	SpaceToast	in some cases it might be useful, but typically... WHY?
2016-02-22 11:00:25	tomboy64	chry: {k,x,l,}ubuntu?
2016-02-22 11:00:28	FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Oh, well I've got an LVM+LUKS root :D
2016-02-22 11:00:30	username234	_anomaly_: yeah.  uvesafb let you do things vesafb couldn't (like set the refresh > 60 Hz)
2016-02-22 11:00:56	FrostFeline	SpaceToast: At some point I'm planning to throw in wireless wake on lan and remote decryption using dropbear in initrd
2016-02-22 11:00:56	chry	Question still remains the same...

2016-02-22 11:02:19	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: I'd follow by questioning why you do LVM+LUKS, but that's your choice really~
2016-02-22 11:02:32	FrostFeline	As opposed to LUKS+LVM?

2016-02-22 11:04:21	SpaceToast	laptops are easier to sell
2016-02-22 11:04:28	SpaceToast	cash is weird, maybe they didn't find it
2016-02-22 11:04:40	username234	it was sitting in the open ;-P
2016-02-22 11:04:54	FrostFeline	Maybe they were blind thieves.
2016-02-22 11:05:15	FrostFeline	This is why everyone should have killer robots in their house. To keep things like this from happening.
2016-02-22 11:05:24	FrostFeline	Is there any problem that a killer robot can't solve?
2016-02-22 11:05:31	username234	now that's impressive. They managed to steal a bunch of stuff, navigate an unfamiliar home, all the while minimizing the damage they caused.

2016-02-22 11:07:07	FrostFeline	username234: That way the emergency personell know not to go into your house at all, or bring rocket lawnchairs.

2016-02-22 11:08:01	_anomaly_	in au, if a burglar breaks in to your home and you injure them while defending your property and loved ones they can sue you for attempted manslaughter and grievous bodily harm
2016-02-22 11:08:06	_anomaly_	which is just stupid

2016-02-22 11:09:40	_anomaly_	if they attack me first, but i'm too fast, and i get some punches in on them but they are unable to connect, I'm the guiltier party

2016-02-22 12:30:56	HedgeMage	No clue, sorry.  I'm having a love affair with i3wm.
2016-02-22 12:31:25	stressfactor	I'm gonna get around to trying it some day
2016-02-22 12:33:08	stressfactor	Anyone know how to change the background color that isn't covered by the image in awesomeWM? A section of the background that the image doesn't cover is black and I would like to change it.
2016-02-22 12:33:47	dcosnet	HedgeMage: i prefer fluxbox
2016-02-22 12:34:15	HedgeMage	dcosnet: I'm really stuck on tiling at this point. I don't think I could be happy with anything else any more.

2016-02-22 12:38:54	HedgeMage	Whatever WM you use (I don't think DEs are quite the same, because they tend not to be as internally consistent, or as different from one another), I think it eventually becomes so integrated into your workflow that switching is painful.
2016-02-22 12:39:08	HedgeMage	I used flux at one point in history, but that was ages ago, and not for very long.

2016-02-22 12:46:50	FrostFeline	SpaceToast: Any particular advantage of loop aes over dm-crypt bare or LUKS?
2016-02-22 12:47:34	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: on what?
2016-02-22 12:47:42	FrostFeline	on a laptop
2016-02-22 12:47:43	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: sorry for missing the context
2016-02-22 12:48:06	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: I was talking about how I use LVM+LUKS on my laptop, and SpaceToast suggested loop aes
2016-02-22 12:49:45	FrostFeline	Hm....
2016-02-22 12:49:54	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: dmcrypt on a cryptoloop without luks will hide the type of encryption you used to the degree that it takes someone with my level of crypto knowledged (advanced-intermediate) as opposed to any sysadmin to see what kind you used, because it's not specified in a header.  One tiny step harder to crack, but MUCH easier to break if you forget the settings you used.  Possibly deniable if combined
2016-02-22 12:49:56	HedgeMage	with other tech.
2016-02-22 12:50:18	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: I advise using the LUKS setup unless you really know what the hell you are doing.
2016-02-22 12:50:18	FrostFeline	Oh
2016-02-22 12:50:49	HedgeMage	Oh, another advantage of LUKS over a bare dmcrypt-cryptoloop setup is that with LUKS you can change your passphrase without re-encrypting the whole damn partition.
2016-02-22 12:50:57	FrostFeline	Well the NSA isn't after my laptop just yet, so I think I'll avoid bothering with deniable encryption. ;)
2016-02-22 12:51:36	HedgeMage	It's only semi-deniable anyway.  Given that DHS and NSF and DOE and DOD already all pay me, I'd assume NSA have already got at least one person as good as me on the payroll.
2016-02-22 12:52:02	HedgeMage	It's not "totally deniable" just "deniable beneath a certain analysis threshold" (skill plus compute power)
2016-02-22 12:52:48	FrostFeline	What do you mean? Shouldn't the encrypted data look like white noise? Or does aes itself leave signatures?
2016-02-22 12:52:58	FrostFeline	(presuming you don't already have the encryption key)
2016-02-22 12:53:50	 < 	damex (~damex@funtoo/dev/damex) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-02-22 12:53:53	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: You can see patterns that would make you think it's probably AES...whether or not that's good enough for a court has never been tested...but there's always a windowless room in an undisclosed location, etc. etc.
2016-02-22 12:54:16	HedgeMage	At that point, I'm not sure I'm worried about mathematical certainty, IOW
2016-02-22 12:54:38	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: They can't rubber hose me if I remove my nerves! hue hue
2016-02-22 12:54:57	HedgeMage	lol
2016-02-22 12:56:12	FrostFeline	I'm sure the people that are willing to use deniable encryption seriously are in such dire straits that they'd be generally willing to endure prison or torture to protect those secrets.
2016-02-22 12:58:19	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: What do you think about truecrypt hidden volume type setups, where you can have two seperate systems in one disk that are both fully bootable?
2016-02-22 12:59:00	FrostFeline	Of course if you mount root rw without mounting the hidden volume you risk corrupting it (in a truecrypt setup).
2016-02-22 12:59:32	FrostFeline	Shame about truecrypt going under.
2016-02-22 12:59:38	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: There are two things I think about the truecrypt thing:
2016-02-22 12:59:49	chry	HedgeMage, could you share some good resources of crypto-knowledge? 'Cause mine equals -∞
2016-02-22 13:00:24	HedgeMage	1) I don't run windows on anything but a disposable gaming system, so I've never had cause to look into it closely enough to know that particular system's pros and cons, or how well the recent audit was done.
2016-02-22 13:00:24		[13:00]
2016-02-22 13:00:52	FrostFeline	Wait, what does truecrypt have to do with windows?
2016-02-22 13:01:32	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: While it's a system-independent FDE tool, it's most popular amond Windows users afaik, unless I'm more sleep deprived than I thought and mixing my nouns
2016-02-22 13:01:46	FrostFeline	I didn't know that.
2016-02-22 13:01:51	FrostFeline	heh
2016-02-22 13:02:04	HedgeMage	no, right thing, just confirmed
2016-02-22 13:02:10	HedgeMage	I'm not insane (well, no more than usual)
2016-02-22 13:02:18	dcosnet	^^
2016-02-22 13:02:24	FrostFeline	Well makes sense I guess. Linux already has FDE tools
2016-02-22 13:03:02	HedgeMage	2) In general, because Truecrypt is well known, even if it doesn't have patterns that demonstrate its presence, I'm willing to bet that a suspicious person with a swinging lightbulb, rubber hose, battery, and jumper cables is going to assume that the junk partition on the same machine as your suspiciously sparse windows install is a truecrypt partition and torture you just in case.
2016-02-22 13:04:47	FrostFeline	What if your fake os isn't suspiciously sparse?
2016-02-22 13:05:29	FrostFeline	Can you have more than one hidden volume?
2016-02-22 13:05:53	dcosnet	what if your entire encrypted target is well hidden in a bunch of map files for installed games?
2016-02-22 13:05:56	dcosnet	pff. good luck
2016-02-22 13:06:26	FrostFeline	Yeah but those game map files use well known formats with little noise for stego.
2016-02-22 13:06:44	dcosnet	eh alot of games use compressions
2016-02-22 13:06:48	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: It's been my experience that the kind of people willing to electrocute people for information as a career aren't that picky about the details.
2016-02-22 13:06:51	HedgeMage	Just sayin'
2016-02-22 13:06:54	FrostFeline	lossless compression,
2016-02-22 13:07:00	dcosnet	ah
2016-02-22 13:07:25	FrostFeline	CS isn't going to be any good if the map files evaluate to something different at every load ;)
2016-02-22 13:07:51	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: Yes but if you're at that point you're going to be tortured for fun and can't really stop it.
2016-02-22 13:08:05	HedgeMage	I think that when I see the scary guy with all the scars walk up holding a taser, I'm not going to argue about the bit patterns on my HDD, I"m going to shoot my way out.
2016-02-22 13:08:15	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: probably
2016-02-22 13:08:45	dcosnet	everyone apears to forget about freedom and right to physically hide things.
2016-02-22 13:08:52	*	dcosnet points at nature
2016-02-22 13:09:03	dcosnet	geocache
2016-02-22 13:09:04	dcosnet	cough
2016-02-22 13:09:26	dcosnet	but i suppose your encryption wont hurt
2016-02-22 13:10:17	HedgeMage	:)
2016-02-22 13:10:25	HedgeMage	dcosnet: Oh, I haven't forgotten.
2016-02-22 13:10:37	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: I was thinking either a) you have a second fake os on the same hard drive or b) have a booby trapped os that will subtly corrupt the encryption header of your drive and c) tie the encryption to a smartcard
2016-02-22 13:11:13	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: i.e.  have the normal syslog path in your boobytrapped os overwrite parts of the actual data you're trying to protect.
2016-02-22 13:11:52	dcosnet	sounds flawless. i always wanted to loose my data.
2016-02-22 13:12:17	FrostFeline	dcosnet: So don't mount and boot boobytrapOS?
2016-02-22 13:13:16	dcosnet	ya you mean the thing that those looking around are likely to do first try? sure. i suppose taking a loss can be a planed risk
2016-02-22 13:13:39	dcosnet	aka, backups
2016-02-22 13:14:00	*	dcosnet points at the tv show "nakita"
2016-02-22 13:14:06	hosler	standard is to make at least 3 backups before enabling write mode
2016-02-22 13:14:27	hosler	and never mess with original
2016-02-22 13:14:28	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: I have one machine that for $reasons I am particularly careful with.  It's LUKS-encrypted (not with AES).  Instead of just a passphrase, it uses a gpg key to decrypt.  That gpg key is stored on a tamper resistant smartcard and nowhere else.  The unencrypted UEFI FS (kernel, initramfs) is on a small removable USB that is stashed separate from both the machine and the smartcard when not in
2016-02-22 13:14:31	HedgeMage	use.
2016-02-22 13:14:49	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: The gpg key has a strong passphrase, which only I know.
2016-02-22 13:14:58	dcosnet	completely off topic but i've been waiting for a defrag to finish running for 3 days now
2016-02-22 13:15:28	*	dcosnet glares at screen
2016-02-22 13:15:28		[13:15]
2016-02-22 13:15:29	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: Also, it's on a platter drive with a strong electromagnet stored nearby...just in case.
2016-02-22 13:15:35	FrostFeline	No the idea is that you give out your fakeos password , then when they try to coerce you you give them the booby trapped os password. The booby trapped os has suitably incriminating photos or such and silently corrupts the data you're trying to protect as part of it's normal operations.
2016-02-22 13:15:41	FrostFeline	, dcosnet
2016-02-22 13:15:54	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: No thermite, just in case? :)
2016-02-22 13:16:07	dcosnet	heh
2016-02-22 13:16:09	FrostFeline	Actually that would be really cool.
2016-02-22 13:16:24	HedgeMage	FrostFeline: No, but while we own the structure we live in, we are currently on rented land.  When I own my own house, I suppose I could rig such a thing if I wanted.
2016-02-22 13:16:32	dcosnet	hak9 i think did a thermite experiment with a laptop
2016-02-22 13:16:43	dcosnet	or maybe some other vlogger
2016-02-22 13:16:45	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: Well not enough thermite to melt the apartment obviously.

2016-02-22 13:16:56	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: Just enough to melt the disk it's sitting on beyond recoverability
2016-02-22 13:17:17	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: You could use some custom electronics work to put a circuit with a battery and capacitors to drive a couple of kv across the flash memory of an SSD

There are 42 other points of entry on those reports that are weaker than that machine, and all of them hold the data longer, too.
2016-02-22 13:24:11	+iamben	hosler: dude i got my wifis so fast, last week i was 10mbits then i fixed a driver and was 40mbits now i got a new AP and i'm 140mbits
2016-02-22 13:24:18	dcosnet	i dislike whoever coded the % remaining timer for myDefrag ... they are sadist or something.
2016-02-22 13:24:21	FrostFeline	HedgeMage: TBH the electronics work isn't that complicated, just have a voltage multiplier circuit connected to a button on your laptop and draw from the main laptop battery to keep it charged at all times.
2016-02-22 13:24:25	hosler	iamben: go for 200
2016-02-22 13:24:44	FrostFeline	Push a button, sparks fly out of the machine, all solid state storage fried in 1ns

2016-02-22 13:25:04	FrostFeline	As part of the laptop
2016-02-22 13:25:08	+iamben	hosler: i squint real hard and it's still 140... i guess i need a new wifi card for that

2016-02-22 13:25:35	hosler	iamben: take a power adapter that dishes out more amps and stick it into AP
2016-02-22 13:25:38	hosler	that should do it

2016-02-22 13:34:39	chry	You have a bluray drive? ;o
2016-02-22 13:34:41	FrostFeline	It's rated for 25MiB/s on BD-R
2016-02-22 13:34:50	FrostFeline	chry: A usb bluray drive costs about 80 bucks.
2016-02-22 13:35:16	FrostFeline	chry: I got a bluray drive instead of a dvd superdrive because I like to future proof my hardware.
2016-02-22 13:35:41	FrostFeline	Also I can watch blurays using makemkv :)
2016-02-22 13:35:43	chry	Ok, so how much space can that drive drive in?
2016-02-22 13:36:20	+iamben	are those the "optical" discs my grandpa talks about?
2016-02-22 13:36:33	FrostFeline	chry: A dual layer bluray can hold 50GB

2016-02-22 13:37:07	chry	iamben, was gonna ask the same q...
2016-02-22 13:37:23	FrostFeline	blurays aren't going to go away though.
2016-02-22 13:37:40	FrostFeline	Movie studios are going to continue to distribute movies that way.
2016-02-22 13:38:15	FrostFeline	Cuz there are still plenty of people (and it'll stay that way if US ISPs have anything to say about it) who don't have the tubes to stream gigabytes of movies per day.
2016-02-22 13:39:19	+iamben	but back to the original topic, it's quite amazing how fast an optical drive can write, tbh
2016-02-22 13:39:39	FrostFeline	iamben: optical drives could be much faster :)
2016-02-22 13:39:59	FrostFeline	iamben: Just make optical discs that can take more rotational force. Imagine a 15krpm optical drive.
2016-02-22 13:40:01	chry	I remember 8.5G rw dvds...
2016-02-22 13:40:08	+iamben	writing to a disc of plastic? im impressed
2016-02-22 13:40:19	+iamben	by melting stuff
2016-02-22 13:40:39	FrostFeline	Well it's melting dye that's specifically designed to be melted.
2016-02-22 13:40:58	FrostFeline	The disk could be backed by steel for all it cares in theory.
2016-02-22 13:41:39	FrostFeline	How fast would an optical disk have to spin for Tbps sequential write? :>
2016-02-22 13:42:13	FrostFeline	You'd have to have a pretty powerful laser to to write to a disc moving that fast.
2016-02-22 13:42:26	+iamben	probably should just use a sata hard drive at that point
2016-02-22 13:42:31	chry	It'd spin so fast that it could probably hover like a drone...
2016-02-22 13:42:59	FrostFeline	iamben: I also find that optical discs are much more relable ways of booting older hardware or hardware that's the least bit nonstandard.
2016-02-22 13:43:07	FrostFeline	but that's just me
2016-02-22 13:43:10	chry	Even hdds are going ancient now...
2016-02-22 13:43:30	FrostFeline	chry: Nah.... HDDs aren't going to be ancient until flash has the same price/GB
2016-02-22 13:44:02	FrostFeline	I still pick HDDs over flash every time because I care much less about boot times than how  much porno I can stuff on my drive :)
2016-02-22 13:44:06	chry	And by flash you mean ssd?
2016-02-22 13:44:07	chry	xD
2016-02-22 13:44:16	FrostFeline	SSDs use flash memory, yes
2016-02-22 13:44:42	chry	Wait...what? You store pornos on your machine? Who does that??
2016-02-22 13:44:45	chry	;o
2016-02-22 13:44:55	+iamben	chry: local porn and optical media...
2016-02-22 13:45:01	FrostFeline	chry: You can't stream 4K porno yet ;)
2016-02-22 13:45:09	FrostFeline	chry: Tubes too small for that

2016-02-22 13:46:56	+iamben	heheh ok im convinced, ssd has no advantage

2016-02-22 13:48:17	+iamben	i guess you value mass local storage more than responsive OS/apps?
2016-02-22 13:48:31	+iamben	boot hits the disk hard, launching apps does

2016-02-22 13:48:46	FrostFeline	Most of my apps are under 100MB

2016-02-22 13:49:17	+iamben	the size is not important, your old disk has good sequential read

2016-02-22 15:28:52	tortib	lol
2016-02-22 15:29:43	FrostFeline	Somone should write a novel about a dystopian future where it's illegal to trigger other people.

2016-02-22 15:30:24	FrostFeline	Novels would just be big blocks of mostly redacted text.

2016-02-22 15:33:19	tortib	FrostFeline damn
2016-02-22 15:33:33	tortib	tamiko so what distro leads to salvation?
2016-02-22 15:33:37	tortib	Let me guess...Gentoo?

2016-02-22 15:34:10	FrostFeline	I like gentoo.
2016-02-22 15:34:17	tortib	I ran gentoo for 5 years
2016-02-22 15:34:20	tortib	it was painful
2016-02-22 15:34:38	FrostFeline	Gentoo is just peachy if you don't install X or GTK or Qt
2016-02-22 15:34:50	tortib	hah yeah because i like viewing pages in lynx :p
2016-02-22 15:34:53	FrostFeline	There are plenty of applications that don't use those libraries
2016-02-22 15:35:00	FrostFeline	Like vsftpd
2016-02-22 15:35:34	+tamiko	tortib: For the enlightened one it is self-evident.
2016-02-22 15:35:51	+steev	wut
2016-02-22 15:36:22	FrostFeline	Gentoo makes an excellent server :)
2016-02-22 15:36:45	FrostFeline	The build times aren't that big for say samba on a core2duo
2016-02-22 15:36:46	tortib	tamiko so am I enlightened and my soul wont be damned to a eternal hell?

2016-02-22 15:37:06	tortib	Well that isn't good
2016-02-22 15:37:10	FrostFeline	Of course since gentoo is a meta distro you could use gentoo to roll your own linux distro
2016-02-22 15:37:22	FrostFeline	Using something like deb or rpm
2016-02-22 15:37:32	+steev	like chromeos

2016-02-23 01:44:10	+doc235	iamben i ran lilo and got this error, i googled it but found nothing but an old 2010 askubuntu forum about partuuid
2016-02-23 01:44:16	+doc235	Unrecognized token "rootdelay" at or above line 21 in file '/etc/lilo.conf
2016-02-23 01:44:28	+Smiley	http://pastebin.com/4xVnKvCh << iamben  :/
2016-02-23 01:44:30	+iamben	doc235: did you put it on the append line?
2016-02-23 01:45:04	+doc235	hmm no idea w2here that is
2016-02-23 01:46:23	+iamben	doc235: it's in lilo.conf after the root= and other lines defining an entry, add     append="rootdelay=10"
2016-02-23 01:47:50	+doc235	ok i put it there and lilo ran with no errors
2016-02-23 01:48:01	+doc235	reboot time

2016-02-23 01:49:28	+doc235	ok iamben that did not help, it
2016-02-23 01:49:47	+iamben	did you see it wait for 10 seconds or so before the panic?
2016-02-23 01:49:51	+doc235	DID delay cause it said waiting :) but it still failed to boot. same kernel panic
2016-02-23 01:50:02	+iamben	pastebin most recent .config
2016-02-23 01:50:16	+doc235	ok will have to reboot it
2016-02-23 01:50:55	+iamben	you can just boot to your existin genkernel kernel, right? you dont have to keep using a livecd
2016-02-23 01:51:03	+doc235	no
2016-02-23 01:51:15	+doc235	i need the cd if i don't use genkernel to load it
2016-02-23 01:51:27	+doc235	the initram
2016-02-23 01:52:45	+iamben	doc235: yeah but why not just define 2 entries in lilo.conf, one for the genkernel+initramfs, and one for your test manual kernel? when the manual one fails, you go back to the genkernel one
2016-02-23 01:53:23	+doc235	i did iamben. i need to chroot to edit lilo.conf and then run lilo again
2016-02-23 01:53:47	+iamben	why woudl you need to chroot? boot the genkernel kernel, to your real gentoo, and then no chroot is needed
2016-02-23 01:53:58	+doc235	i can't iamben
2016-02-23 01:54:06	+iamben	why not?
2016-02-23 01:54:08	+doc235	i don't have any idea how. it panics
2016-02-23 01:54:17	+iamben	your genkernel kernel panics?
2016-02-23 01:54:18	+doc235	a kernel panic is a lock up
2016-02-23 01:54:30	+iamben	i thought the genkernel one was working fine
2016-02-23 01:54:40	+doc235	yes, but it offers a shell or enter the device
2016-02-23 01:54:45	+doc235	and then it boots
2016-02-23 01:54:48	+doc235	but i nee3d
2016-02-23 01:54:48		[01:54]
2016-02-23 01:54:51	+doc235	arggggggggg
2016-02-23 01:54:52	+iamben	so use that to boot, not the livecd
2016-02-23 01:55:01	+doc235	i just realized what you where saying
2016-02-23 01:55:08	+doc235	crap sorry will fix thgis time
2016-02-23 01:55:19	+iamben	doing livecd+chroot is just a lot of waasted time, that's all
2016-02-23 01:55:24	+doc235	i need 2 entries not the one and swap
2016-02-23 01:55:46	+Smiley	yusss
2016-02-23 01:55:47	+iamben	yes, keep a known-working entry for the genkernel one, then a NEW entry for this test kernel
2016-02-23 01:55:50	+Smiley	never override working kernels

2016-02-23 02:01:04	_Allah_	hi
2016-02-23 02:01:17	cookiemon5ter	what what the wifi range is for my phone
2016-02-23 02:01:28	_Allah_	im having some update issues
2016-02-23 02:01:44	+iamben	_Allah_: are you THE Allah?
2016-02-23 02:01:54	_Allah_	?
2016-02-23 02:01:58	_Allah_	the 1 and only
2016-02-23 02:02:14	+iamben	ok proceed with your questions

2016-02-23 02:02:46	+doc235	iamben i added the genkernel initramfs as a seperate entry and i adedd the roortdelay and it did not seem to do anything and i still hade3 to type /dev/sda3
2016-02-23 02:03:03	+doc235	hmmmmmmmm and i just looked up and have no radeon support
2016-02-23 02:03:20	_Allah_	ive updated the  Portage cache
2016-02-23 02:03:23	+iamben	doc235: rootdelay only works for non-initramfs.  to get the genkernel initramfs to use a delay, you need append="scandelay=10"
2016-02-23 02:05:19	+doc235	i have no internet on the box now. all the drivers did not load
2016-02-23 02:05:29	+doc235	i don't know what happened
2016-02-23 02:05:59	+iamben	yeah, it gets a bit ugly when you mix genkernel w/ manual, the manual make modules_install removed all the modules that genkernel had produced and was using
2016-02-23 02:06:25	+iamben	you may be able to work around this with CONFIG_LOCALVERSION on the manual kernel

2016-02-23 02:07:03	_Allah_	hi
2016-02-23 02:07:09	+doc235	any way to recover or do i need to run genkernel again?
2016-02-23 02:07:11	_Allah_	i get  "Cannot resolve a virtual package name to an ebuild"

2016-02-23 02:07:46	+iamben	doc235: you'll have to run genkernel again, unfortunately.  use --kernel-config= to point it to a config in /etc/modules/ so that you don thave to do any reconfiguration
2016-02-23 02:07:59	+iamben	/etc/kernels/ contains your last genkernel-made config
2016-02-23 02:08:22	+iamben	_Allah_: can you use wgetpaste to pastebin the full emerge output?
2016-02-23 02:08:41	FrostFeline	The idea of a laptop skin thermal sensor is really cool
2016-02-23 02:08:54	FrostFeline	You can use thermal throttling to keep your lap from getting burned.
2016-02-23 02:09:34	_Allah_	overspeccing the cpu can be good

2016-02-23 02:10:38	+Smiley	lol
2016-02-23 02:10:55	+iamben	doc235: but it still succeeds when you tell it to use /dev/sda3?
2016-02-23 02:10:57	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: link?
2016-02-23 02:11:04	FrostFeline	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling
2016-02-23 02:11:28	+doc235	yes iamben
2016-02-23 02:11:55	+iamben	doc235: can you tell me what "cat /proc/cmdline" says after booting that way?
2016-02-23 02:12:31	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: not exactly what I wanted, which is good
2016-02-23 02:12:49	FrostFeline	To keep your lap from getting toasted? :)
2016-02-23 02:13:06	+doc235	boot_image=genke3rnel ro root=803 scandelay = 10
2016-02-23 02:13:34	+doc235	iamben should i just rerun genkernel all and then rebboot?
2016-02-23 02:13:36	+wiktor_b	FrostFeline: I thought you could make it into a product: just a sticker you stick to your laptop
2016-02-23 02:13:38	+doc235	reboot
2016-02-23 02:13:44	+iamben	so i guess lilo is taking it upon itself to translate that root= param to something else
2016-02-23 02:13:55	FrostFeline	wiktor_b: Call it lapsafe
2016-02-23 02:14:01	+wiktor_b	yo
2016-02-23 02:14:18	+wiktor_b	now I just need to find super thin temperature sensors
2016-02-23 02:14:18	+doc235	iamben, i understand that. but why is the question :)

2016-02-23 02:14:53	FrostFeline	_Allah_: Overspeccing the CPU is good, but if you've got a 150W TDP chip it's still going to put out 150W of heat at max load.
2016-02-23 02:15:05	+doc235	iamben i can switch to grub if i must :) butt i know what to do in default lilo setup :)
2016-02-23 02:15:07	FrostFeline	_Allah_: So you probably still need some idle injection of some sort
2016-02-23 02:15:19	+iamben	doc235: you really dont know much about lilo setup, if we're honest.
2016-02-23 02:15:23	+iamben	i think it's time for grub2
2016-02-23 02:15:50	FrostFeline	_Allah_: Unless you've got some restricted system I guess (one where the user can't put the system at max tdp)
2016-02-23 02:15:51	+doc235	ok walk mne thru it :) will i lose my current configuration on the menu
2016-02-23 02:16:07	+doc235	i know genkernel works for me
2016-02-23 02:16:15	+iamben	emerge grub && grub2-install /dev/sda && grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2016-02-23 02:16:26	tomboy65	hmmm
2016-02-23 02:16:37	+iamben	if it finds the genkernel kernel+initramfs in that mkconfig call, you're all done
2016-02-23 02:16:39	tomboy65	it seems like java-config singlehandedly blocke my -uDN world

2016-02-23 02:18:01	tomboy65	iamben: nope

2016-02-23 02:20:46	+iamben	so the upgrade of java-config to 2.0.0-r3 should cause the unmerge of the wrapper
2016-02-23 02:20:57	tomboy65	ah, yes
2016-02-23 02:21:12	tomboy65	it was only java-config-wrapper depending on it, but it still blocked
2016-02-23 02:21:41	+iamben	it's the opposite, java-config depended on java-config-wrapper

2016-02-23 02:58:41	+doc235	not yet. generating a new kernel. the old one had no modules support
2016-02-23 02:59:11	+Griz64	damn, son. didn't you save your old .config ?
2016-02-23 02:59:19	+doc235	nope
2016-02-23 02:59:25	+doc235	didn't think about it
2016-02-23 02:59:28	+iamben	you have a copy
2016-02-23 02:59:31	+doc235	i totally brain farted
2016-02-23 02:59:45	+iamben	if you want the genkernel config, it's in /etc/kernels.  if you want the manual config one, it's in /boot/config-*

2016-02-23 03:00:01	+iamben	both genkernel and make install will make a copy of your config automatically
2016-02-23 03:00:06	+doc235	oh ok iamben. will try to remember that
2016-02-23 03:00:33	+doc235	it is building the modules right now. take sabout 2 hours to build a full kernel
2016-02-23 03:01:10	+doc235	iamben, why would i need the old genkernel .config since a genkernal all replaces it?
2016-02-23 03:01:47	+iamben	doc235: well in case you used "genkernel --menuconfig all" to make any minor tweaks to the build, importing the config would preserve those changes
2016-02-23 03:02:31	+doc235	but how? i am totally new to genkernel. and know less about it than i do lilo :)

2016-02-23 03:04:06	+iamben	how what?
2016-02-23 03:04:11	+doc235	is there a oarameter to pass to keep the old .config? or is it a menuconfig to adjust it?
2016-02-23 03:04:15	+doc235	ohhhh wait
2016-02-23 03:04:22	+doc235	damn i am screwing up today
2016-02-23 03:04:27	+doc235	i know the answer
2016-02-23 03:04:34	+iamben	genkernel --kernel-config=/etc/kernels/something --menuconfig all
2016-02-23 03:04:47	+doc235	ok thats what i wanted to know
2016-02-23 03:04:48	+doc235	ty
2016-02-23 03:05:03	+iamben	that will load up the old config, and fire up menuconfig so you can double-check to make sure things look good, then you save/exit menuconfig and it starts the build
2016-02-23 03:05:17	+doc235	ok
2016-02-23 03:08:58	+Tear	how do i make weechat stop sending BEL to the terminal @_@

2016-02-23 03:32:55	+likewhoa	the problem is with that setting, i was stuck at 1920x1080 on my radeon card
2016-02-23 03:33:49	+iamben	vesafb is probably keeping the real DRM drivers from working so it's using either vesa or fbdev for xorg
2016-02-23 03:34:07	+iamben	and is thus limited to the vbios vesa modes, and also will be quite slow

2016-02-23 04:35:00	+iamben	doc235: what does "cat /proc/fb" return now?
2016-02-23 04:35:18	+doc235	waiting on it to boot again
2016-02-23 04:35:24	+doc235	only take a minute
2016-02-23 04:36:11	+doc235	iamben the video seems to be behavbing right
2016-02-23 04:36:27	+doc235	dammit check forced. rbooting to much
2016-02-23 04:36:34	+doc235	how do i change that ?
2016-02-23 04:36:43	+iamben	let's not get side tracked
2016-02-23 04:36:49	+iamben	put that on your todo list for later
2016-02-23 04:36:50	+doc235	ok :)
2016-02-23 04:40:03	cookiemon5ter	doc235: send your computer to iamben and cut him a check
2016-02-23 04:40:58	+doc235	that wouldn't help ME any :) i need to learn this stuff
2016-02-23 04:41:05	+doc235	well remember it in some cases
2016-02-23 04:41:18	cookiemon5ter	it is a survival situation
2016-02-23 04:41:18	+doc235	i could not get a job in IT if iwanted to
2016-02-23 04:41:28	cookiemon5ter	just panic do what you need and carry on
2016-02-23 04:41:40	+doc235	:)
2016-02-23 04:41:57	cookiemon5ter	doc235: best thing you can do is RTFM
2016-02-23 04:42:05	cookiemon5ter	if you really want to learn
2016-02-23 04:42:10	cookiemon5ter	and experiment
2016-02-23 04:42:13	+doc235	what manual. old stuff has no manuals :)
2016-02-23 04:42:30	cookiemon5ter	gentoo has the best manuals
2016-02-23 04:42:49	+doc235	yep

2016-02-23 04:43:04	+likewhoa	just google it
2016-02-23 04:43:50	cookiemon5ter	doc235: also, install grub ffs
2016-02-23 04:43:59	+Griz64	hahahaha
2016-02-23 04:43:59		[04:43]
2016-02-23 04:44:24	+Griz64	cookiemon5ter, he's older than dirt! ;-)  doc235 changes about as fast as the glaciers!
2016-02-23 04:44:27	+iamben	grub would certainly make all these kernel parameter tests much easier
2016-02-23 04:44:36	+Griz64	*nod*
2016-02-23 04:44:56	cookiemon5ter	Griz64: if you don't know what either is doing then it doesn't matter
2016-02-23 04:45:12	+doc235	ok iamben it is booted

2016-02-23 04:45:59	+doc235	ok ok. i will switch to the grub2 with no color menus
2016-02-23 04:46:05	+doc235	after i get x :)
2016-02-23 04:46:43	+Griz64	doc235, Thank You. That is SO much easier for my eyeholes to grok.

2016-02-23 04:51:45	cookiemon5ter	doc235: xorg log would be most helpful
2016-02-23 04:51:59	FrostFeline	iamben: This seems like it can only end in tears (hibernate with swapfile) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1042946
2016-02-23 04:52:28	+iamben	i do not do hibernate/sleep here
2016-02-23 04:52:54	+doc235	no xorg.log cookiemon5ter when the system did the chcek on startup it said deleted it and reclaimed inode?
2016-02-23 04:52:55	+iamben	doc235: what does "cat /proc/fb" return when booting with the new kernel parmas?
2016-02-23 04:52:59	cookiemon5ter	this is where iamben draws the line
2016-02-23 04:53:00	FrostFeline	iamben: The proposed solution on ubuntu is to use direct disk access + an offset to read the swapfile.
2016-02-23 04:53:26	FrostFeline	iamben: You'll be sad when e2defrag moves the start of the swap partition.
2016-02-23 04:53:30	+doc235	0 ATI Radeon 5b62 iamben
2016-02-23 04:53:43	FrostFeline	or when a gap in the swap file happens to coincide with some important system file
2016-02-23 04:54:03	+iamben	doc235: try this instead:  create /etc/modprobe.d/noradeonfb.conf with a single line:   blacklist radeonfb
2016-02-23 04:54:13	+iamben	apparently the blacklist kernel param isnt respected
2016-02-23 04:54:14	+Smiley	I hibernate into the swapfile
2016-02-23 04:54:17	+Smiley	it works really nicely
2016-02-23 04:54:28	+Smiley	obviously it wouldn't do if you're using swap but most of the time you'r not :D
2016-02-23 04:55:11	+doc235	ok iamben it is created
2016-02-23 04:55:32	+iamben	doc235: see if "rmmod radeonfb" is able to unload the module, w/o reboot
2016-02-23 04:55:59	+doc235	rmmod: ERROR: Module radeonfb is in use
2016-02-23 04:56:33	+doc235	iamben ^^
2016-02-23 04:56:44	+iamben	yeah i was afraid of that, you'll need to reboot again
2016-02-23 04:56:46	+chithead	you need to disconnect the radeonfb module from framebuffer console
2016-02-23 04:56:57	dugz	doc235, do you have that thing booting better yet?
2016-02-23 04:57:24	+doc235	yes kinda dugz, i still have to manually enter /dev/sda3
2016-02-23 04:57:35	FrostFeline	Smiley: I still see a problem with direct disk access as the solution
2016-02-23 04:57:36	+chithead	see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt (but best do it via ssh because vga text console may or may not be restored when you do that)
2016-02-23 04:57:50	FrostFeline	Smiley: Does the resume hook in initramfs handle filesystems?
2016-02-23 04:58:05	FrostFeline	or would a fragmented swap file just kill whatever happens to be in the middle?
2016-02-23 04:58:26	dugz	doc235, if you edited that file, run "genkernel --no-clean initramfs"  then run lilo
2016-02-23 04:58:30	FrostFeline	Well, it's not reading anything at the start, but I mean would a fragmented file crash the system, Smiley

2016-02-23 05:14:53	+iamben	doc235: actually you can just rm the module to save some time for now, check "find /lib/modules -name radeonfb.ko"
2016-02-23 05:14:59	dugz	remove radeonfb
2016-02-23 05:15:00	+iamben	if it returns a result, rm that file

2016-02-23 05:17:13	+iamben	doc235: if you removed that module, then @ next reboot it should not load, and hopefully the real radeon driver will take over

2016-02-23 05:17:30	+doc235	ok iamben will reboot and see
2016-02-23 05:17:36	dugz	you have to turn the framebuffers on with a kernel command

2016-02-23 05:18:58	dugz	iamben, he should edit make.conf and have VIDEO_CARDS="fglrx"

2016-02-23 05:34:13	FrostFeline	Griz64: TIL systemd gobbled up UPower's suspend functionality
2016-02-23 05:34:50	FrostFeline	Griz64: I learned it while trying to discern the proper place to hook suspend by browsing the upower source code (backend of powerdevil)
2016-02-23 05:35:24	FrostFeline	Some day systemd is going to be mandatory, even if you don't use it as your init :P
2016-02-23 05:35:32	dugz	I have a VM that boots with systemd. with vga=current it goes from the SYSLINUX menu to the LXDE desktop in about 5 seconds

2016-02-23 05:38:45	dugz	doc234, you have 2 files to work with. /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/genkernel.cfg
2016-02-23 05:38:57	+iamben	FrostFeline: i know that was needed for a while, but i thought it's not anymore

2016-02-23 05:39:39	+doc234	dugz. iwill be setting up grub2 soon as i get reset from the system being down
2016-02-23 05:39:44	FrostFeline	I was just looking for the dumb hooks so I could make my USB drivers not lock up. :)
2016-02-23 05:39:45	+doc234	i need to do some updates
2016-02-23 05:40:33	dugz	doc234, grub2 is the lazy man's way to do it, and tbh it just works™ most of the time
2016-02-23 05:40:52	cookiemon5ter	FrostFeline: what device?
2016-02-23 05:41:13	FrostFeline	cookiemon5ter: chromebook

2016-02-23 05:46:51	cookiemon5ter	FrostFeline: if you want some advice, i wouldn't buy anything 32bit if you're a linux user
2016-02-23 05:46:56	cookiemon5ter	FrostFeline: unless it's arm
2016-02-23 05:47:09	FrostFeline	What's wrong with 32 bit x86?
2016-02-23 05:47:14	dugz	iamben, yes i believe you were giving me some examples of a hand written grub2 file, but adding features like a graphic menu to Grub2 is quite complicated using the script
2016-02-23 05:47:21	FrostFeline	it's all ibm compatible right?
2016-02-23 05:48:02	FrostFeline	so I got suspend to work... sorta. :D

2016-02-23 05:49:12	+iamben	doc234: the radeon thing is a genkernel bug, i suspect the root= thing is too

2016-02-23 06:14:00	+doc234	my clock is correct i had it wrong in kde
2016-02-23 06:14:01	+iamben	make sure your timezone is correct before changing time in kde's tool

2016-02-23 06:14:37	+doc234	wait it IS off 17 hours
2016-02-23 06:14:37	cookiemon5ter	isn't there an option for kde to use your system time?
2016-02-23 06:14:41	FrostFeline	At least messing up your timezone won't hose your system the way having a wrong date can.
2016-02-23 06:14:54	cookiemon5ter	i believe kde lets you use different times
2016-02-23 06:15:01	cookiemon5ter	hence ...
2016-02-23 06:15:01	+doc234	it does
2016-02-23 06:15:15	FrostFeline	I've done that a couple times and had files in the future.
2016-02-23 06:15:15	cookiemon5ter	therefore set it to use system time
2016-02-23 06:15:16	+iamben	but your linux will always internally use utc
2016-02-23 06:15:19	+doc234	you canhave 2 timezones active that i know of
2016-02-23 06:15:29	+iamben	so you really need to get "date -u" reporting the correct UTC time, which is the same for everyone
2016-02-23 06:15:43	+iamben	THEN your higher level tools can apply a timezone on top of it for display purposes
2016-02-23 06:15:54	+doc234	i have 2:15am monday 02-22-2016 UTC
2016-02-23 06:15:59	FrostFeline	Unless you're using windows then linux is sad :(
2016-02-23 06:16:07	*	cookiemon5ter resets iamben's clock to julian 0
2016-02-23 06:16:23	+doc234	and 9:15 pm sunday 02-21
2016-02-23 06:16:27	+iamben	FrostFeline: linux still speaks UTC, it just knows it needs to assume the BIOS clock is local and take that into account ONCE during boot
2016-02-23 06:16:45	+iamben	doc234: get a cron tool and fix it, that's the easiest way
2016-02-23 06:16:47	FrostFeline	iamben: Not if you're running systemd :D
2016-02-23 06:17:02	FrostFeline	iamben: At least systemd has a big scary warning about that.
2016-02-23 06:17:26	FrostFeline	Systemd devs also didn't care to mount EFI variables readonly.
2016-02-23 06:17:30	+iamben	FrostFeline: it has some possible issues regardless of init system, but yes systemd does warn about it
2016-02-23 06:17:42	+iamben	you are just repeating systemd stuff you read in headlines, huh?
2016-02-23 06:18:19	+doc234	ok, i have ntp emerged and run /etc/init.d/ntpd start.
2016-02-23 06:18:20	FrostFeline	;)
2016-02-23 06:18:36	FrostFeline	iamben: Yes, but in this case it was kind of funny
2016-02-23 06:18:47	+doc234	time corrected
2016-02-23 06:18:54	+iamben	FrostFeline: my gentoo/openrc has:  efivarfs on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
2016-02-23 06:19:09	+iamben	iow, "not a systemd bug"
2016-02-23 06:19:33	+doc234	so iamben how would i use tune2fs tomodify that boot order or number? i figure change -1 to 4
2016-02-23 06:19:45	FrostFeline	iamben: I never said it was "a systemd bug"
2016-02-23 06:19:47	+iamben	doc234: honestly i'd crank it up to like 100
2016-02-23 06:19:57	+doc234	ok
2016-02-23 06:19:57	+iamben	FrostFeline: you're implying it is a systemd-specific problem, no?
2016-02-23 06:20:06	FrostFeline	I'm trying to find the actual quote that I found humerous
2016-02-23 06:20:28	+iamben	probalby something like "this isnt our problem"
2016-02-23 06:20:55	+iamben	if a downstream distro wants to RO mount it to protect users from stupid stuff, they can
2016-02-23 06:21:10	FrostFeline	It wasn't a poettering quote, actually
2016-02-23 06:21:12	FrostFeline	I thought it was
2016-02-23 06:21:22	FrostFeline	"systemd is not responsible for allowing kernel code that I wrote to destroy your shitty firmware. I think you get to blame me instead." --Matthew Garrett
2016-02-23 06:21:29	+doc234	how? :) hehehe tune2fs -c 10 does nothing but give me a help screen
2016-02-23 06:22:01	+iamben	doc234: you didnt specify a filesystem (/dev/sda3 for you)
2016-02-23 06:22:53	FrostFeline	iamben: It's always funny to see linux devs taking a massive crap on things because they can ;)
2016-02-23 06:22:53		[06:22]
2016-02-23 06:22:53	+doc234	ok that worked thanks
2016-02-23 06:23:19	FrostFeline	Maybe they've seen too much bad software to be nice anymore
2016-02-23 06:24:20	+iamben	i think lots of development teams talk to eachother that way and no one is offended, but on a public mailing list people liek to take it out of context

2016-02-23 06:28:57	FrostFeline	k :p

2016-02-23 06:40:08	+doc234	going to install plasma5 now
2016-02-23 06:40:15	+doc234	this should be interesting
2016-02-23 06:40:20	+Tear	pulseaudio is actually pretty impressive in some ways
2016-02-23 06:40:41	+Tear	it lets you change the output device of any application at runtime, you can't do that on windows
2016-02-23 06:41:24	FrostFeline	I wonder if you can still use windows pulseaudio binaries
2016-02-23 06:41:50	+doc234	iamben when i get grub installed will i have to edit the cfg file? and is it editable with nano?
2016-02-23 06:42:22	+doc234	or just try it from scratch on reboot?
2016-02-23 06:42:25	+Tear	with my onboard audio the device doesn't exist if nothing is plugged in
2016-02-23 06:42:29	FrostFeline	Tear: JACK and JACK Router are available for windows iirc
2016-02-23 06:42:35	+iamben	doc234: emerge grub && grub2-install /dev/sda && grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2016-02-23 06:42:36	FrostFeline	Tear: Not sure how well it works.
2016-02-23 06:42:40	+Tear	so if i forget to plug in headphones i have to restart the app that wants to pllay sound
2016-02-23 06:42:50	+iamben	doc234: the grub2-mkconfig part will generate a config for you, just make sure that it detects the kernels that you want
2016-02-23 06:42:51	+doc234	yea, i read the wiki iamben but thanks
2016-02-23 06:42:52	+Tear	on windows that is, on linux i don't have to
2016-02-23 06:43:04	+doc234	ok
2016-02-23 06:43:44	FrostFeline	Something is wrong with your windows install then.
2016-02-23 06:44:00	FrostFeline	or the application you are using... could be that.
2016-02-23 06:44:56	+doc234	https://bpaste.net/show/b703356b8d30
2016-02-23 06:44:56	+doc234	 iamben looks like it worked
2016-02-23 06:45:07	FrostFeline	Normally you can do what your describing by changing the "default audio device" in the windows playback device tab of audio settings
2016-02-23 06:45:36	FrostFeline	but pulse isn't a UI nightmare.
2016-02-23 06:45:44	+doc234	iamben i am going to reboot with grub now. brb i hope
2016-02-23 06:45:45	+iamben	doc234: it did erroneously pair the manual kernel with the genkernel initramfs, but that's ok, the genkernel one should still boot and it's first priority
2016-02-23 06:45:58	+doc234	ok
2016-02-23 06:46:08	+doc234	brb

2016-02-23 06:50:43	+iamben	now that i look at the handbook more closely, for initramfs/genkernel it does have you add an extra root= to the append line
2016-02-23 06:50:55	+iamben	must be a known/solved lilo issue
2016-02-23 06:51:11	+NeddySeagoon	doc235: you can have a timeout if you want

2016-02-23 09:31:36	mvaenskae	is anyone here using a dual-service/dual-init setup?
2016-02-23 09:32:13	mvaenskae	i am wondering if i should just go all out systemd with this install and remove any openrc-stuff
2016-02-23 09:32:19	mvaenskae	or if i should keep it
2016-02-23 09:33:36	mvaenskae	i assume if i keep both then i also need to follow general openrc setup rules if i want to switch on every reboot
2016-02-23 09:34:52	+iamben	it's not currently safe to remove openrc, even if you boot via systemd
2016-02-23 09:35:13	mvaenskae	oh, then i shall keep it at least around :)
2016-02-23 09:35:27	mvaenskae	can you point me to why it's unsafe?
2016-02-23 09:35:35	+Cheaterman	Interesting iamben, same question

2016-02-23 09:36:30	mvaenskae	i want to understand what the hype is around systemd so i will give it a fair chance
2016-02-23 09:36:33	+iamben	mvaenskae: currently some system tools still make use of /etc/init.d/functions.sh which openrc provides.  migrating them to use gentoo-functions instead is a slow work in progress
2016-02-23 09:37:00	mvaenskae	gentoo-functions is an init-agnostic api?

2016-02-23 09:38:13	+iamben	functions.sh from openrc just provides some stupid little functions like einfo/ewarn to print stuff on the screen, they are re-implemented in a separate package/binary to uncouple it from openrc
2016-02-23 09:38:22	+iamben	it's some historical accident that it was part of openrc, i think

2016-02-23 09:39:18	+iamben	i guess probably they were part of baselayout-1 and it made sense that gentoo baselayout provided some helpers for gentoo tools like gcc-config et al
2016-02-23 09:39:44	+iamben	then bl/openrc were split and the helper functions went over to the openrc side
2016-02-23 09:41:30	+doc235	mvaenskae, it isn't so much that he knows such a large amount, it is that he is so damn young tohave accumulated it all :)

2016-02-24 01:49:40	jaake	for instance, block 127.0.0.1 in iptables and you can still use localhost. I think that localhost & ::0 don't make it to the TCP stack? perhaps it uses some sort of UNIX socket instaead?

2016-02-24 01:53:45	hosler	are you using unstable gcc on your i486?

2016-02-24 07:23:15	hosler	genkernel ruins everything for everyone
2016-02-24 07:23:31	hosler	it's like ubuntu meets gentoo
2016-02-24 07:23:36	+iamben	genkernel's kernel config handling has been reworked lately, there were several regressions
2016-02-24 07:24:03	+Cheaterman	genkernel is much better than I expected
2016-02-24 07:24:07	hosler	though i do appreciate the gentoolkit
2016-02-24 07:24:09	+Cheaterman	It actually does nothing for me, which is just fine
2016-02-24 07:24:22	+Cheaterman	it calls menuconfig, and builds the kernel, and make install, and done
2016-02-24 07:24:26	+Cheaterman	nothing fancy, nothing obscure
2016-02-24 07:24:39	+Cheaterman	installs modules and initrd too
2016-02-24 07:24:54	hosler	no way
2016-02-24 07:24:55	+iamben	most of what genkernel does is good, it's just got a questionable kernel config default
2016-02-24 07:25:01	+Cheaterman	I disabled it cleaning the sources each time, too, otherwise recompiles would take a long time
2016-02-24 07:25:12	+doc235	when i type groups doc235 in root i get a nice size list of groups . but when i run groups as user doc235 i only get 4. why?
2016-02-24 07:25:23	+Cheaterman	iamben: Agreed, moreover it doesn't include that much hardware actually

2016-02-24 07:25:39	hosler	does groups take args?
2016-02-24 07:25:45	eroen	^
2016-02-24 07:25:49	+doc235	not that i know of
2016-02-24 07:25:55	+Cheaterman	hosler: yes
2016-02-24 07:25:59	hosler	wat
2016-02-24 07:26:00	+Cheaterman	I just checked, it does
2016-02-24 07:26:15	+doc235	but why the difference?
2016-02-24 07:26:24	+Cheaterman	No idea, doc235, that's the troublesome part
2016-02-24 07:26:38	eroen	doc235: did you log in before or after changing groups?
2016-02-24 07:26:41	+doc235	yea, been troublesome on this install
2016-02-24 07:26:51	+doc235	yes eroen, rebooted
2016-02-24 07:26:53	eroen	k
2016-02-24 07:27:49	+doc235	that is odd.
2016-02-24 07:28:00	+Cheaterman	iamben: You get enough to boot with genkernel, which is already nice btw, but you most likely won't get all of your hardware to work without going into menuconfig at least once
2016-02-24 07:28:17	hosler	genkernel is for scrubs
2016-02-24 07:28:24	+Cheaterman	At least that's my experience of it lately, I suppose that's what's intended
2016-02-24 07:28:41	+iamben	the included defaults are not well maintained so newer hardware has issues
2016-02-24 07:29:00	+iamben	it's good for building initramfs though
2016-02-24 07:29:05	+Cheaterman	Okay, that probably didn't help because I tried it on very recent machines
2016-02-24 07:29:10	+Cheaterman	Yes
2016-02-24 07:29:15	+Cheaterman	IIRC it's the only recommended way
2016-02-24 07:29:25	hosler	the ONLY recommended way?
2016-02-24 07:29:33	+Cheaterman	recommended/supported, yes
2016-02-24 07:29:33	redeyedman	I can build w/o genkernel but I use it for fancy gentoo bootsplash (borrowed from Gentoo DVD)
2016-02-24 07:29:34	+iamben	it supports the boring stuff like ahci just fine, but there are a lot of wired & wireless NIC drivers that are too new for genkernel
2016-02-24 07:29:57	hosler	do all of you use genkernel?
2016-02-24 07:29:59	+Cheaterman	iamben: that, and even KMS wasn't set properly
2016-02-24 07:30:15	+Cheaterman	hosler: I tried it for the first time lately, works nicely

2016-02-24 07:30:29	redeyedman	splashutils require initramfs
2016-02-24 07:30:36	hosler	nah
2016-02-24 07:30:40	+Cheaterman	exactly, I use it for plymouth
2016-02-24 07:30:46	+iamben	the KMS stuff should be fixed now

2016-02-24 07:31:05	+iamben	and on newish kernels, KMS isnt optional on the major drivers anyway
2016-02-24 07:31:11	+Cheaterman	iamben: Well, I don't know, I tested maybe 3 to 4 months ago
2016-02-24 07:31:18	+Cheaterman	And it wasn't purrfect
2016-02-24 07:31:24	eroen	:3
2016-02-24 07:31:26	+Cheaterman	That's true
2016-02-24 07:31:51	+doc235	i used to roll my own kernel and usually got things right. but this time i could not get it to boot without an initramfs. but now that i installed grub(fixed my boot problem) i may try to roll my own again

2016-02-24 07:32:55	+Cheaterman	If you need an initramfs just because some of your stuff is compiled as module, it's not like you really need it
2016-02-24 07:33:29	+doc235	right
2016-02-24 07:33:30	+Cheaterman	If I were you I'd stop tweaking it when the two following conditions are met:

2016-02-24 07:33:48	redeyedman	2)
2016-02-24 07:33:50	+Cheaterman	I made a Gentoo theme
2016-02-24 07:33:59	+doc235	i will be trying it myself again. right now i want it stable from the new mobo and major ram upgrade
2016-02-24 07:34:02	+Cheaterman	My laptop is themed from grub to desktop
2016-02-24 07:34:04	redeyedman	Cheaterman: can you show me it?

2016-02-24 07:39:31	Smiley	lol
2016-02-24 07:39:39	+Cheaterman	Smiley: it's just a program that allows you to have an image and a spinner as background while your system boots
2016-02-24 07:39:42	+Cheaterman	instead of seeing openrc
2016-02-24 07:39:45	+Cheaterman	it's nice and eye candy

2016-02-24 08:52:45	tomboy64	am i evil for responding "no, it's running rock-solid-stable here" on principle, whenever someone asks whether anyone experiences random crashes with $app? without giving version, error msg, anything?
2016-02-24 08:53:06	hosler	tomboy64: no you say "that version has always been like that"

2016-02-24 08:53:49	tomboy64	or maybe i should say "that's to be expected with glibc. it will only run stable with musl."
2016-02-24 08:54:02	hosler	or better yet you tell them that the $app is crap and tell them to google for an alternative
2016-02-24 08:54:43	tomboy64	iamben: you always get bonus points. I'm amazed time and again how you know about $random-issues i couldn't even imagine how to approach remote-diagnosing

2016-02-24 08:56:33	SpaceToast	tomboy64: ask them to send you their binary and you'll give them a patch. The patch turns the glibc binary to a static musl one

2016-02-24 10:42:11	SpaceToast	Griz64: it's just that, in the US, the Snap-On is 70$. Which means 100$ CAD. And that has to get imported. So the price goes up to 160$ CAD + 47$ shipping. Meanwhile, the value of everything that isn't imported is the same.
2016-02-24 10:42:27	+Griz64	*nod*
2016-02-24 10:42:36	SpaceToast	so we pay the same price for a burger, but I pay over double what you do for stuff made in the US :(

2016-02-24 10:43:36	SpaceToast	and they're canada-based, so I don't have to pay ridiculous fees

2016-02-24 12:21:43	hosler	new jib
2016-02-24 12:21:45	hosler	job
2016-02-24 12:21:59	hosler	no formal offer yet, but it sounds like they gonna make one
2016-02-24 12:22:16	PrincessKnoeki	that's a good thing though right?
2016-02-24 12:22:16		[12:22]
2016-02-24 12:22:28	hosler	depends on how much they offer really
2016-02-24 12:24:25	PrincessKnoeki	hmmm
2016-02-24 12:24:56	PrincessKnoeki	here's a thing
2016-02-24 12:25:23	PrincessKnoeki	could a VM running gentoo still be used as a distcc node?
2016-02-24 12:25:37	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, would it be 500% stupid?
2016-02-24 12:26:23	 > 	msjche (~msjche@gateway/vpn/privateinternetaccess/msjche) has joined #gentoo-chat
2016-02-24 12:26:42	+zlg	hosler: nice, I
2016-02-24 12:26:45	+zlg	 hope it works out
2016-02-24 12:26:47	PrincessKnoeki	I guess it would mostly be used to support a raspberry pi. Other than that the box is running win7 because of reasons.
2016-02-24 12:26:49	hosler	yar
2016-02-24 12:27:01	dugz	you could probably turn Windows into a distcc slave with a VM
2016-02-24 12:27:35	PrincessKnoeki	I'm just sorta wondering if the VM bit would significantly impact the usefulness of it.
2016-02-24 12:28:23	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, it's got an AMD Athlon II X4 640 @ 3GHz. not sure if that has any kind of virtualization support
2016-02-24 12:28:35	dugz	only if its really starved for threads probably
2016-02-24 12:28:54	PrincessKnoeki	heh
2016-02-24 12:29:07	PrincessKnoeki	yeah nah, at the moment that box is practically yawning.
2016-02-24 12:29:27	dugz	a lot of time is spent configuring and preprocessing and distcc can't speed that up
2016-02-24 12:29:49	PrincessKnoeki	I suppose.
2016-02-24 12:30:02	PrincessKnoeki	I wonder *how* slow the rpi is with compiling though
2016-02-24 12:30:05	dugz	i use it here, now. for my atom server
2016-02-24 12:30:32	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, I've installed gentoo on a Libretto 100CT like... I dunno (: 7 years ago?
2016-02-24 12:30:47	PrincessKnoeki	166MHz Pentium MMX, 32MB RAM, 2.1GB HDD
2016-02-24 12:30:55	PrincessKnoeki	compiling a kernel on that was *hilarious*
2016-02-24 12:31:02	dugz	a rpi will be slow compiling even with distcc, but it will take forever without it
2016-02-24 12:31:04	fs0ciety	i imagine if you compiled webkit on an atom by the time it finishes you would be applicable for your retirement fund
2016-02-24 12:32:04	+zlg	hahah
2016-02-24 12:32:23	PrincessKnoeki	:D
2016-02-24 12:33:02	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: well, I do have some patience. I'm in no hurry to do anything with the pi, I mean, I've barely touched it in the 2 or 3 years I've owned it
2016-02-24 12:33:24	PrincessKnoeki	so I mean, if it just sits there for a few days compiling I'm not going to be terribly upset
2016-02-24 12:33:26	+zlg	When I'm back to work I should look into a toy computer
2016-02-24 12:33:36	PrincessKnoeki	I've just never set up distcc so it seems like a fun project.
2016-02-24 12:33:42	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, its doable. setup your cross-distcc and let er rip, thats how i did my beagleboard
2016-02-24 12:33:44	fs0ciety	i've been meaning to try and install gentoo on hp stream that has a celeron N chip.  But I'd imagine it would take at least a week to get it up and running
2016-02-24 12:34:07	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: you can always do most of the install on another machine
2016-02-24 12:34:12	PrincessKnoeki	that's what I did with the libretto 100CT
2016-02-24 12:34:27	dugz	fs0ciety, not if you just make the system, and keep it real basic.
2016-02-24 12:34:28	PrincessKnoeki	mostly out of necessity because only DOS/windows was bootable on that otherwise
2016-02-24 12:34:32	fs0ciety	PrincessKnoeki: that is true, I was even tempted to make a binary repo for it. hahaha
2016-02-24 12:34:48	PrincessKnoeki	nice propriatary PCMCIA FDD that thing had
2016-02-24 12:35:01	+zlg	FDD, as in floppy drive?
2016-02-24 12:35:09	PrincessKnoeki	so you could boot some linux distro from floppy, and then when it asks for the 2nd disk it wouldn't be able to find the drive anymore. (:
2016-02-24 12:35:13	PrincessKnoeki	yes.
2016-02-24 12:35:15	+zlg	hahah, wow
2016-02-24 12:35:26	+zlg	I still remember floppies that were actually floppy.
2016-02-24 12:35:27	PrincessKnoeki	I'm talking about a "netbook" from 1997 here (:
2016-02-24 12:35:29	fs0ciety	someone needs to put linux on a c90 cassette tape :)
2016-02-24 12:35:32	+zlg	5.25"ers
2016-02-24 12:35:41	PrincessKnoeki	zlg: I have loads of those and I use them regularly
2016-02-24 12:35:45	PrincessKnoeki	also have an 8incher here
2016-02-24 12:35:52	PrincessKnoeki	but no drive for that, sadly.
2016-02-24 12:35:54	+zlg	How do you avoid data loss?
2016-02-24 12:35:55	dugz	i have some kinda floppy+card reader combo drive
2016-02-24 12:36:02	+zlg	Aren't they very susceptible to magnetism?
2016-02-24 12:36:06	PrincessKnoeki	not that much
2016-02-24 12:36:16	PrincessKnoeki	they're pretty resillient if you take good care of them
2016-02-24 12:36:20	fs0ciety	haha i remember when i get my first high density 1.2mb 5.25" disk
2016-02-24 12:36:25	fs0ciety	i was like oooooo....
2016-02-24 12:36:30	PrincessKnoeki	I have a box here that I've had for almost 10 years
2016-02-24 12:36:36	PrincessKnoeki	most of those disks are older than I am
2016-02-24 12:36:39	PrincessKnoeki	still work fine
2016-02-24 12:36:47	fs0ciety	i have told of old 90s floppy games in their original boxes from when i bought them as a kid
2016-02-24 12:36:58	fs0ciety	i dare not try to access them in fear of a data error
2016-02-24 12:37:02	PrincessKnoeki	I've got other disks (both 5.25" and 3.5") that are just completely done for because they were stored in bad environments
2016-02-24 12:37:05	+zlg	I remember getting a zip disk and thinking "100 MB, that's so much space! I can store a handful of mp3s on it!"
2016-02-24 12:37:21	fs0ciety	do you remember being able to format 3.25" disks to 2.88mb
2016-02-24 12:37:21		[12:37]
2016-02-24 12:37:28	fs0ciety	sorry 3.5"
2016-02-24 12:37:30	PrincessKnoeki	temperature and humidity fluctuation are more likely to kill floppies than magnets overal
2016-02-24 12:37:41	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: I have one of those 2.88MB drives (:
2016-02-24 12:37:41	dugz	my next computer won't have a floppy drive. card reader has been handy though
2016-02-24 12:37:42	+zlg	I do, actually. I don't know how it did it though since floppies are only 1.44MB
2016-02-24 12:37:55	PrincessKnoeki	eh, not per se (:
2016-02-24 12:38:01	fs0ciety	zlg: it was some propietary formatting scheme
2016-02-24 12:38:05	+zlg	fs0ciety: ah
2016-02-24 12:38:11	fs0ciety	microsoft created it, i'll see if i can find some info about it
2016-02-24 12:38:15	+zlg	In other words, some form of compression
2016-02-24 12:38:19	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, windows stored 720kB on a 3.5" DD, apple/amiga did 880kB (:
2016-02-24 12:38:28	dugz	the 2.88MB drives were really rare
2016-02-24 12:38:57	PrincessKnoeki	just so we all know on what level i am: http://i.imgur.com/7STTzRQ.jpg :D
2016-02-24 12:39:00	+zlg	I remember going onto the Web and looking up walkthroughs for video games
2016-02-24 12:39:20	tortib	PrincessKnoeki holy crap
2016-02-24 12:39:36	+zlg	Gamesages was awesome, and then I found GameFAQs, way back when it was ran by a single person.
2016-02-24 12:39:51	PrincessKnoeki	the raspberry pi that's hidden somewhere on that small CRT is probably the most modern piece of hardware in there :P
2016-02-24 12:40:02	PrincessKnoeki	s/on/behind/
2016-02-24 12:40:07	+zlg	Wow, an actual C64?
2016-02-24 12:40:11	+zlg	I've never seen one in person.
2016-02-24 12:40:20	PrincessKnoeki	there's no C64 in that picture
2016-02-24 12:40:36	+zlg	Then what's that machine on the left
2016-02-24 12:40:36	PrincessKnoeki	C128 though, which has pretty much an entire C64 in it
2016-02-24 12:40:43	+zlg	ah
2016-02-24 12:41:00	PrincessKnoeki	the machine on the left is an MSX2. what you see on the display is the C128's start screen/OS (:
2016-02-24 12:41:08	+zlg	nice

2016-02-24 12:41:44	+zlg	Is that a DOS machine on the right?
2016-02-24 12:41:48	fs0ciety	how many people actually owned a c128
2016-02-24 12:41:48	EasyAsPie	how r u tortib
2016-02-24 12:41:53	fs0ciety	probably like 4 people

2016-02-24 12:44:20	PrincessKnoeki	it's on top of the c128 in that stack.
2016-02-24 12:44:20	dugz	the c128 could dual boot CP/M
2016-02-24 12:44:25	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: badly.
2016-02-24 12:44:34	fs0ciety	old computing was magical
2016-02-24 12:44:37	fs0ciety	really niche
2016-02-24 12:44:37	PrincessKnoeki	but I do intend to try it.
2016-02-24 12:44:38	dugz	oh, unusably

2016-02-24 12:53:36	+zlg	I've been playing around with some older tech as well, just on the software side.
2016-02-24 12:53:40	+zlg	Gopher's a pretty neat protocol.
2016-02-24 12:54:03	+zlg	It's more streamlined than HTTP, text-friendly, hierarchy-based.
2016-02-24 12:54:14	PrincessKnoeki	mmhm
2016-02-24 12:54:23	PrincessKnoeki	i was considering setting up some gopher stuff as well.

2016-02-24 12:54:35	+zlg	I've not played around with symlinks with it yet, but if that works, then I honestly can't think of any real downsides to it.
2016-02-24 12:55:17	+zlg	There's only one gopher server in the gentoo repo, though.
2016-02-24 12:55:35	+zlg	I might fix that some time; I've been thinking of bringing gophernicus to the tree
2016-02-24 12:55:38	PrincessKnoeki	^^

2016-02-24 12:56:17	PrincessKnoeki	virtualizing MacOS on an amiga. :D
2016-02-24 12:56:23	+zlg	haha, wow
2016-02-24 12:56:43	+zlg	where'd you get that background?
2016-02-24 12:56:44	PrincessKnoeki	it's actually virtualization because shapeshifter gets to bang straight on the CPU
2016-02-24 12:56:47	PrincessKnoeki	uh
2016-02-24 12:56:52	PrincessKnoeki	i can't remember honestly
2016-02-24 12:56:55	+zlg	haha
2016-02-24 12:56:59	+zlg	It's good art
2016-02-24 12:57:04	+zlg	good use of color
2016-02-24 12:57:15	PrincessKnoeki	it was originally like 1280*720, but I cropped it down to 1024*768
2016-02-24 12:57:20	PrincessKnoeki	mmhm

2016-02-24 13:07:33		[13:07]
2016-02-24 13:07:50	PrincessKnoeki	I know exactly what you mean :D
2016-02-24 13:07:56	fs0ciety	thought you would
2016-02-24 13:08:14	fs0ciety	took way too much time, and the people were way too volatile
2016-02-24 13:08:15	PrincessKnoeki	there are still a lot of "we don't talk about that part of our history" people in the demoscene (:
2016-02-24 13:08:54	fs0ciety	well it kind of originated from there i guess
2016-02-24 13:09:57	PrincessKnoeki	not even kind of
2016-02-24 13:09:58	PrincessKnoeki	(:
2016-02-24 13:10:09	fs0ciety	haha true
2016-02-24 13:10:11	PrincessKnoeki	there's some very clear strong roots (:
2016-02-24 13:10:17	fs0ciety	well all those wonderful loaders
2016-02-24 13:10:28	fs0ciety	especially more so in the 80s and 90s
2016-02-24 13:10:40	fs0ciety	are you a coder in the group
2016-02-24 13:10:49	PrincessKnoeki	coder, graphician, musician

2016-02-24 13:10:54	PrincessKnoeki	etc
2016-02-24 13:11:04	PrincessKnoeki	i do everything a little bit (:
2016-02-24 13:11:10	+zlg	what part of history are we talking?
2016-02-24 13:11:11	fs0ciety	isn't there like two factions now, there is a scripting language for scene demos, or do you do that hardcore writing a 64k asm demo
2016-02-24 13:11:12	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=6726&order=release
2016-02-24 13:11:26	PrincessKnoeki	zlg: cracking scene of the 80s gave birth to the demoscene.
2016-02-24 13:11:33	+zlg	ohhh
2016-02-24 13:11:35	+zlg	Yeah.
2016-02-24 13:11:38	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: heh, no
2016-02-24 13:11:44	+zlg	keygen music is the best
2016-02-24 13:11:47	PrincessKnoeki	there's not that much of a divide
2016-02-24 13:12:37	fs0ciety	always wanted to go to one of those parties, alas in AU there is not much .. and travelling to EU is the best option fo rit
2016-02-24 13:12:38	PrincessKnoeki	there's plenty of size-unrestricted demos that have very fancy tech
2016-02-24 13:12:54	PrincessKnoeki	every catagory has it's own thing
2016-02-24 13:13:09	fs0ciety	i did look at scene recently, just going through some demos.. nice to a linux demoscene
2016-02-24 13:13:24	PrincessKnoeki	the big uppsetting thing these days is the mere existence of unity/ue4
2016-02-24 13:13:24	fs0ciety	glad its all not bloody win32/64
2016-02-24 13:13:28	fs0ciety	well not all*
2016-02-24 13:13:33	PrincessKnoeki	linux demos are a pain though
2016-02-24 13:13:39	fs0ciety	how so
2016-02-24 13:14:03	PrincessKnoeki	well, they sometimes will depend on outdated libraries
2016-02-24 13:14:03	fs0ciety	couldn't you essentially static library the whole and not worry about dependencies
2016-02-24 13:14:08	fs0ciety	the whole thing*
2016-02-24 13:14:09	PrincessKnoeki	yes
2016-02-24 13:14:10	fs0ciety	can't type today
2016-02-24 13:14:13	PrincessKnoeki	but do people do that?
2016-02-24 13:14:15	PrincessKnoeki	not really (:
2016-02-24 13:14:22	fs0ciety	except valve. haha
2016-02-24 13:14:39	PrincessKnoeki	and then there's a bunch of demos that have just been ported from windows
2016-02-24 13:14:54	fs0ciety	i look forward to seeing vulkan demos :)
2016-02-24 13:14:59	PrincessKnoeki	because they use SDL so it's easy to just port it to osx/linux/android/etc
2016-02-24 13:15:01	PrincessKnoeki	there's already one
2016-02-24 13:15:11	PrincessKnoeki	friend of mine released a vulkan demo on the day it came out :P
2016-02-24 13:15:44	fs0ciety	ooo. ooo.. is it public
2016-02-24 13:15:49	PrincessKnoeki	http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66950
2016-02-24 13:16:23	PrincessKnoeki	requires windows 10 64-bit apparently since that's the only thing the vulkan drivers are available for, windows wise.
2016-02-24 13:16:38	fs0ciety	that's fine

2016-02-24 13:17:26	fs0ciety	tbh as long as you are willing to play with nvidia profiles, i got lots of wonderful improvements
2016-02-24 13:17:32	PrincessKnoeki	twice the money for +20% performance
2016-02-24 13:17:34	fs0ciety	i can play witcher 3 on ultra at 2k
2016-02-24 13:17:46	fs0ciety	its more than 20% for me
2016-02-24 13:17:52	fs0ciety	for me on average its about 35-40%
2016-02-24 13:17:58	fs0ciety	as long as the game supports it
2016-02-24 13:18:29	fs0ciety	nvidias official sli profiles usually suck balls, theres a whole scene of custom sli profiles for tons of games
2016-02-24 13:18:47	EasyAsPie	gross

2016-02-24 13:19:09	EasyAsPie	yes
2016-02-24 13:19:54	fs0ciety	initially i was going to passthrough gpu into a vm for the second 970 in linux
2016-02-24 13:19:59	fs0ciety	then i realised intel jibbed me
2016-02-24 13:20:04	fs0ciety	no passthrough on K series intel chips
2016-02-24 13:20:57	fs0ciety	which reminds i think i have a friend who has an Atari TT lying around his house.  you've inspired me to grab it off him
2016-02-24 13:21:32	fs0ciety	also known as the Atari ST TT Falcon
2016-02-24 13:21:34	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: niiice (:
2016-02-24 13:21:38	PrincessKnoeki	what
2016-02-24 13:21:48	PrincessKnoeki	ST, TT and falcon are all different machines... right?
2016-02-24 13:21:54	PrincessKnoeki	I'm pretty sure...
2016-02-24 13:22:03	fs0ciety	my bad
2016-02-24 13:22:10	fs0ciety	its a TT
2016-02-24 13:22:19	fs0ciety	he does have a falcon, but he refuses to part ways with it
2016-02-24 13:22:22	fs0ciety	understandably
2016-02-24 13:22:27	fs0ciety	he was in the demoscene in the 90s
2016-02-24 13:22:37	PrincessKnoeki	heh
2016-02-24 13:22:37		[13:22]

2016-02-24 13:24:46	fs0ciety	you did.. ive bookmarked it
2016-02-24 13:24:56	fs0ciety	haha.. have you tried emulating the atari on your amiga
2016-02-24 13:24:57	fs0ciety	http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66950
2016-02-24 13:25:01	fs0ciety	woops
2016-02-24 13:25:04	fs0ciety	that was your link
2016-02-24 13:25:06	fs0ciety	gimme a sec
2016-02-24 13:25:20	PrincessKnoeki	I tried emulating the atari VCS
2016-02-24 13:25:24	PrincessKnoeki	it went.. badly (:
2016-02-24 13:25:38	dugz	i think that unless you are a dedicated enthusiast, emulators are the way to go. that old 8-bit hardware is 30 years old now
2016-02-24 13:25:40	fs0ciety	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatari_(emulator)
2016-02-24 13:26:09	fs0ciety	dugz: they just released a handheld zx spectrum on the market
2016-02-24 13:26:10	fs0ciety	I WANNA
2016-02-24 13:26:51	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: or if you want accuracy
2016-02-24 13:27:05	fs0ciety	i think my fondest memory of both atari/amiga 16-bit era is actually writing tons of mods (4-channel music)
2016-02-24 13:27:18	fs0ciety	if there is anything im great at its tracking
2016-02-24 13:27:30	PrincessKnoeki	even if emulators are 95% accurate and seem to run most things fine, it's that 5% that causes unexpected problems (:
2016-02-24 13:27:31	dugz	i was messing around with a dragon64 emulator trying to get OS/9 to run
2016-02-24 13:27:49	fs0ciety	dugz: haha thats an obscure one :)
2016-02-24 13:27:52	PrincessKnoeki	fs0ciety: they re-released that handheld spectrum
2016-02-24 13:28:00	PrincessKnoeki	they already made one
2016-02-24 13:28:05	PrincessKnoeki	and now they made one again
2016-02-24 13:28:15	PrincessKnoeki	and it's still just an emulator running on some generic embedded system
2016-02-24 13:28:31	fs0ciety	PrincessKnoeki: hmm.. if its an emulator screw that
2016-02-24 13:28:31	PrincessKnoeki	you're just as well off using a smartphone (:
2016-02-24 13:28:54	fs0ciety	dugz: for example emulating a c64 is pointless because the SID chip never sounds exactly the same on each machine
2016-02-24 13:29:04	PrincessKnoeki	it's not pointless
2016-02-24 13:29:04	fs0ciety	and lets face it, the reason anyone wants a c64 these days is the sid chip
2016-02-24 13:29:29	fs0ciety	ok it isn't pointless, but i guess im really biased to the sid chip :)
2016-02-24 13:29:36	PrincessKnoeki	all the 8580 revisions sound pretty consistent overal
2016-02-24 13:29:54	PrincessKnoeki	6581... that's more of a "haha lol have fun" thing
2016-02-24 13:30:09	PrincessKnoeki	since the filter sounds different on almost literally every chip
2016-02-24 13:30:16	fs0ciety	hahah yeah.. a swedish company bought the remaining stock of sid chips and made hardware synths out of em
2016-02-24 13:30:33	PrincessKnoeki	they're not the only one that bought "the remaining stock"
2016-02-24 13:30:50	PrincessKnoeki	and I'm willing to bet there's still quite some "remaining stock" laying around in warehouses (:

2016-02-24 13:54:00	hosler	well you should
2016-02-24 13:54:04	PrincessKnoeki	why?
2016-02-24 13:54:05	hosler	because it's important
2016-02-24 13:54:11	hosler	it installs your modules
2016-02-24 13:54:12	PrincessKnoeki	I never use kernel modules
2016-02-24 13:54:19	hosler	yeah you do
2016-02-24 13:54:20	*	dugz uses genkernel with custom things
2016-02-24 13:54:20	PrincessKnoeki	I always just compile everything in
2016-02-24 13:54:31	hosler	thar be modules everywhere
2016-02-24 13:54:34	PrincessKnoeki	because I find loading modules is a royal pain which never works for me
2016-02-24 13:54:43	hosler	it's automatic
2016-02-24 13:54:52	PrincessKnoeki	yes, and all the ones I don't use I opt out of and all the ones I do need I change to be compiled in the kernel

2016-02-24 13:55:03	hosler	some will need to be modules
2016-02-24 13:55:07	hosler	like drivers that require firmware
2016-02-24 13:55:31	PrincessKnoeki	yes, okay.
2016-02-24 13:55:53	PrincessKnoeki	in the case of every single machine I've installed, this has never been a necessity
2016-02-24 13:56:03	hosler	and that's weird
2016-02-24 13:56:10	PrincessKnoeki	why?
2016-02-24 13:56:33	dugz	i use genkernel mostly to make me an initrd with my bootsplash theme
2016-02-24 13:56:34	PrincessKnoeki	literally the only thing I can think of that requires firmware blobs are wifi chipsets (for whatever reason).
2016-02-24 13:56:35	hosler	because it is. it's kinda like saying you never carry money around but instead only use credit cards.
2016-02-24 13:56:49	hosler	everyone got loose change
2016-02-24 13:56:52	PrincessKnoeki	yes, sure
2016-02-24 13:57:18	PrincessKnoeki	but again, I'm saying, I've never needed to use modules or drivers requiring special firmware
2016-02-24 13:57:25	PrincessKnoeki	not on any machine I've installed
2016-02-24 13:57:30	PrincessKnoeki	to my knowledge
2016-02-24 13:57:34	dugz	my tv tuner card needs firmware
2016-02-24 13:57:34	hosler	wow not even for video?
2016-02-24 13:57:54	PrincessKnoeki	NVidia drivers never needed kernel modules for me
2016-02-24 13:58:31	PrincessKnoeki	at least, not that I remember.
2016-02-24 13:58:45	hosler	sounds like you know what you are doing then
2016-02-24 13:59:03	PrincessKnoeki	I might not know what I'm doing. (:
2016-02-24 13:59:21	PrincessKnoeki	I just know that I've never had any issues with not doing make modules_install
2016-02-24 13:59:38	hosler	okie dokie
2016-02-24 13:59:48	PrincessKnoeki	I recall messing with that once, 8 years ago, when I needed wifi drivers
2016-02-24 13:59:52	PrincessKnoeki	"needed"
2016-02-24 14:00:05	PrincessKnoeki	in the end I couldn't get it working so I just gave up on it and used ethernet instead.
2016-02-24 14:00:11	dugz	another thing you probably never did was make firmware_install
2016-02-24 14:00:21	PrincessKnoeki	I've never even heard of that
2016-02-24 14:00:31	PrincessKnoeki	never come across that in the handbook to my knowledge
2016-02-24 14:00:53	dugz	it installs firmware into /lib/firmware
2016-02-24 14:01:41	PrincessKnoeki	heh
2016-02-24 14:01:57	hosler	thats handles by the linux-firmware package
2016-02-24 14:02:29	dugz	yeah it has extra firmware not just what comes with the kernel
2016-02-24 14:05:14	PrincessKnoeki	mmhm.
2016-02-24 14:05:26	PrincessKnoeki	well, we tried to put gentoo on my brother's laptop
2016-02-24 14:05:38	PrincessKnoeki	this was the first time I ever came across linux-firmware (:
2016-02-24 14:06:14	dugz	usually the firmware gets installed once and you never have to mess with it
2016-02-24 14:06:30	PrincessKnoeki	I can say one thing, at least installing the firmware worked
2016-02-24 14:06:38	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, we still didn't get wifi working on it
2016-02-24 14:06:48	PrincessKnoeki	but installing firmware worked.
2016-02-24 14:06:57	hosler	make compile as module :D
2016-02-24 14:06:58	PrincessKnoeki	can't say that much about the debian installer. :')
2016-02-24 14:07:53	dugz	I hope I never have to run the Debian installer ever again
2016-02-24 14:08:04	hosler	i like debian
2016-02-24 14:08:25	dugz	i used to run debian prior to gentoo. its my ex
2016-02-24 14:08:25		[14:08]
2016-02-24 14:08:27	PrincessKnoeki	dugz, it was hilarious
2016-02-24 14:08:43	PrincessKnoeki	it asked to provide firmware for the wifi chipset
2016-02-24 14:09:03	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, yeah let me check my pocket ...
2016-02-24 14:09:04	PrincessKnoeki	so we put it on the flashdrive we installed from. didn't want to recognize it. Tried 2 other flashdrive, didn't want to see it.
2016-02-24 14:09:17	PrincessKnoeki	we thought to skip it... but no, then we needed network :')
2016-02-24 14:11:53	dugz	debian is ok if you just run it stock. frustration sets in when you monkey with it
2016-02-24 14:12:09	hosler	i use to use it for my servers
2016-02-24 14:12:27	hosler	then i figured out you can just rsync stage3 tarball on a debian vps to get gentoo
2016-02-24 14:13:36	PrincessKnoeki	oh geez
2016-02-24 14:13:40	PrincessKnoeki	here start the problems already
2016-02-24 14:13:53	PrincessKnoeki	somehow the gentoo liveCD inside virtualbox has a 10.x.x.x IP
2016-02-24 14:14:37	dugz	yeah i get a 10.x.x.x ip inside virtualbox
2016-02-24 14:14:58	PrincessKnoeki	I'm just wondering where it's getting that from
2016-02-24 14:15:16	hosler	NAT networking
2016-02-24 14:15:27	hosler	it's default in vbox
2016-02-24 14:15:34	PrincessKnoeki	is virtualbox just telling the gentoo guest that that's it's local IP rather than connecting to my network and getting a real IP on my local network?
2016-02-24 14:15:35	dugz	vbox must have a small dhcp server
2016-02-24 14:15:57	hosler	if you want it to be seen on your network you need to be using bridge networking
2016-02-24 14:16:01	PrincessKnoeki	ah
2016-02-24 14:17:31	PrincessKnoeki	...okay what
2016-02-24 14:17:40	PrincessKnoeki	I think it somehow managed to get an IPV6 address now
2016-02-24 14:17:45	hosler	cool
2016-02-24 14:18:02	PrincessKnoeki	oh, I guess that's normal. my windows box has one too.
2016-02-24 14:18:09	PrincessKnoeki	didn't even realize that. heh.
2016-02-24 14:18:28	PrincessKnoeki	I should maybe find a way to disable that
2016-02-24 14:18:30	dugz	its the ipv6 link local address
2016-02-24 14:18:48	PrincessKnoeki	yeah, but I really don't feel like I need ipv6 on my local network :P
2016-02-24 14:18:58	dugz	just ignore it
2016-02-24 14:19:16	PrincessKnoeki	seems like terrible overkill, probably a bunch of my machines don't support it, and it's even harder to memorize than ipv4 :P
2016-02-24 14:19:34	dugz	too much work to disable, and it won't get used unless its needed
2016-02-24 14:19:49	PrincessKnoeki	dang.
2016-02-24 14:20:00	hosler	uh just turn it off in your router
2016-02-24 14:20:07	PrincessKnoeki	somehow I can ping google from the VM
2016-02-24 14:20:08	hosler	or disable it via kernel cmdline in grub
2016-02-24 14:20:11	PrincessKnoeki	but I can't ssh in from my desktop
2016-02-24 14:20:20	dugz	can you ping6 www.google.com ?
2016-02-24 14:20:24	hosler	because you still in NAT
2016-02-24 14:20:36	hosler	i think
2016-02-24 14:20:36	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: yes?
2016-02-24 14:20:45	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, so you have real ipv6
2016-02-24 14:21:08	PrincessKnoeki	oh, now the gentoo guest does have an ipv4 address
2016-02-24 14:21:27	PrincessKnoeki	it didn't the first time i ran ifconfig, but apparently starting sshd did something.
2016-02-24 14:22:47	PrincessKnoeki	...I can ssh in, but only if I'm specifying the IP. Hostname doesn't work. oh well.
2016-02-24 14:23:06	PrincessKnoeki	actually, not oh well. that could probably get annoying in the long run.
2016-02-24 14:23:25	dugz	configure configure configure ...
2016-02-24 14:23:25		[14:23]
2016-02-24 14:24:11	PrincessKnoeki	it's also not letting me log in :')
2016-02-24 14:24:22	PrincessKnoeki	it keeps saying access denied
2016-02-24 14:24:26	hosler	did you set a password yet
2016-02-24 14:24:27	PrincessKnoeki	(and yes, I did set the password)
2016-02-24 14:24:34	hosler	are you trying root?
2016-02-24 14:24:44	PrincessKnoeki	I'm trying to log in as root, yes.
2016-02-24 14:24:48	dugz	i have a pretty neat vbox VM with gentoo and a bunch of debuggers
2016-02-24 14:24:52	hosler	make sure the sshd conf allows root login
2016-02-24 14:24:59	PrincessKnoeki	ah.
2016-02-24 14:25:02	dugz	yes you have to add that line
2016-02-24 14:25:18	hosler	PermitRootLogin yes
2016-02-24 14:25:22	hosler	or something like that
2016-02-24 14:25:41	PrincessKnoeki	I guess they need to either make that default on the liveCD or change the startup text :P
2016-02-24 14:25:48	PrincessKnoeki	I remember just changing the password was enough
2016-02-24 14:25:56	dugz	PermitRootLogin yes
2016-02-24 14:26:01	hosler	most people use systemrescuecd
2016-02-24 14:26:20	hosler	i kinda think gentoolivecd suckks
2016-02-24 14:26:37	dugz	I use puppy linux to install gentoo :D
2016-02-24 14:27:12	dugz	it has all the tools you need, and everything just works
2016-02-24 14:27:44	PrincessKnoeki	ah, sorry. I meant the minimal install CD anyway
2016-02-24 14:28:22	dugz	the minimal install cd is pretty bad, and you still have to download a stage3 and portage
2016-02-24 14:28:49	dugz	once you chroot into the environment it doesn't matter what the host is
2016-02-24 14:28:55	PrincessKnoeki	yeah I guess that's true.
2016-02-24 14:31:25	PrincessKnoeki	>There is no perfect value for the swap partition.
2016-02-24 14:31:29	PrincessKnoeki	yes there is
2016-02-24 14:31:31	PrincessKnoeki	0 bytes
2016-02-24 14:31:33	PrincessKnoeki	:D
2016-02-24 14:32:00	hosler	lol
2016-02-24 14:32:55	dugz	whats the deal, if you at least have your RAM in swap, you can produce a core dump and also hibernate (i think)
2016-02-24 14:34:10	dugz	so I usually set swap ≡ ram
2016-02-24 14:34:42	PrincessKnoeki	heh
2016-02-24 14:36:02	dugz	i'm waiting on my 16GB ram kit to get here from china. $40!
2016-02-24 14:36:44	PrincessKnoeki	neat
2016-02-24 14:36:52	PrincessKnoeki	I was thinking of upgrading my desktop to 32 or 64GB
2016-02-24 14:37:12	dugz	16 is as high as this board can go
2016-02-24 14:37:28	+zlg	I'm sitting at 16GB and I'm fine.
2016-02-24 14:37:30	FrostFeline	Heh
2016-02-24 14:37:38	PrincessKnoeki	oh, I'm fine at 16GB
2016-02-24 14:37:39	+zlg	The next upgrade I need is likely GPU or SSD
2016-02-24 14:37:44	FrostFeline	I smashed my finger so hard that it's a little bit numb :)
2016-02-24 14:37:46	PrincessKnoeki	but it'd be cool
2016-02-24 14:37:51	FrostFeline	broke the nail too
2016-02-24 14:37:56	+zlg	FrostFeline: ow
2016-02-24 14:37:57	dugz	I do fine with 8GB but I would like more to play with VMs
2016-02-24 14:38:12	+zlg	VMs don't perform well enough to my liking.
2016-02-24 14:38:16	+zlg	At least for gaming.
2016-02-24 14:38:23	PrincessKnoeki	actually, sometimes 16GB isn't fine. when I have photoshop, reason, ableton live, chrome with 30 tabs and minecraft running all at ones. alongside a bunch of other things :')
2016-02-24 14:38:38	FrostFeline	zlg: If you're prepared to spend a ton on a board with vt-d you can use pci-e passthrough.
2016-02-24 14:38:38		[14:38]
2016-02-24 14:38:42	dugz	i use VMs for bug hunting, development, testing things
2016-02-24 14:39:07	+zlg	FrostFeline: I thought about switching my system to use the onboard GPU and letting the VM access my unused GPU; would that still require vt-d?
2016-02-24 14:39:23	FrostFeline	zlg: Yes, IIRC
2016-02-24 14:39:26	dugz	it requires IOMMU units in the BIOS
2016-02-24 14:39:43	+zlg	Mm. In that case I guess there's little point :/
2016-02-24 14:39:43	PrincessKnoeki	I'm not a huge fan of VMs because it feels too much like emulation, but I think in this case where I'm building a gentoo system purely as a compile slave for a raspberry pi, it seems a bit ridiculous to actually set up a PC
2016-02-24 14:39:45	FrostFeline	yes, vt-d requires chipset support
2016-02-24 14:40:09	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, i don't see why it couldn't work
2016-02-24 14:40:10	+zlg	I need to set up a 'vanilla' VM for Gentoo development I suppose.
2016-02-24 14:40:15	+zlg	To triage bugs and such
2016-02-24 14:40:24	FrostFeline	zlg: Because vt-d is like an MMU for the various busses on your computer.
2016-02-24 14:40:26	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: eh?
2016-02-24 14:40:52	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, the VM distcc compile slave. so there would be slight latency, big deal
2016-02-24 14:40:57	+zlg	FrostFeline: I guess it'll have to wait until I build a new rig :P
2016-02-24 14:41:00	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: exactly.
2016-02-24 14:41:15	FrostFeline	zlg: Without vt-d you'd need some slow binary trickery for the same effect and it would be trivial to escape the VM  if you have control of a device that has direct access to physical memory.

2016-02-24 14:41:22	+zlg	It'd be nice to run Gentoo full time and use a Windows VM for gaming.
2016-02-24 14:41:48	PrincessKnoeki	as I'm saying, I don't like emulation for the most part but in this case it's just not worth it setting up real hardware (:
2016-02-24 14:41:58	dugz	zlg, yeah i can go the other way, windows fulltime with a gentoo VM, thats the easy way
2016-02-24 14:42:08	FrostFeline	Virtual Machines are exactly like emulators except not ;P
2016-02-24 14:42:12	+zlg	dugz: that feels dirty to me :p

2016-02-24 14:42:48	+zlg	But technically I guess I could throw virtualbox on my Windows harddrive and run my existing Gentoo system through it
2016-02-24 14:42:54	PrincessKnoeki	FrostFeline: well, the emulate a piece of hardware. It's emulation to me.
2016-02-24 14:43:24	dugz	zlg, I have a nice VM of my gentoo phantom debugger over on the windows side

2016-02-24 14:43:30	PrincessKnoeki	I know there's a lot of semantics there about what emulation is or isn't, but by my definition anything that pretends to be the original/real hardware but isn't is an emulator :P
2016-02-24 14:43:40	FrostFeline	Yes, they emulate various pieces of hardware, like hard drive controllers.
2016-02-24 14:43:47	PrincessKnoeki	yes.
2016-02-24 14:43:48	 < 	blueness (~blueness@gentoo/developer/blueness) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-02-24 14:43:54	+zlg	But I'd rather treat Windows as basically a computer console OS
2016-02-24 14:44:04	+zlg	I go to it solely to game, and when I'm done I come back to Gentoo :)
2016-02-24 14:44:10	FrostFeline	But they don't emulate the CPU and have much less overhead than an actual emulator.
2016-02-24 14:44:19	PrincessKnoeki	well, I suppose that is a point.
2016-02-24 14:44:21	dugz	what about paravirtual devices?
2016-02-24 14:44:44	+zlg	If Steam didn't require pulseaudio I might try to get it to work again.
2016-02-24 14:44:49	dugz	vbox can use the virtio-net module for ethernet, thats what I use
2016-02-24 14:45:15	+zlg	I miss Borderlandsing on Gentoo :[
2016-02-24 14:45:17	FrostFeline	I'm not sure, but I don't think it's emulating anything at that point.
2016-02-24 14:45:43	FrostFeline	Isn't the point of paravirt hardware that a guest can call directly into host system calls?
2016-02-24 14:46:35	dugz	PrincessKnoeki, build virtio-net into the kernel so you can use it for your distcc slave (if you don't already have it)
2016-02-24 14:46:42	FrostFeline	zlg: The new xbone and ps4 consoles run on x86 ;)
2016-02-24 14:46:54	FrostFeline	zlg: So in 20 years..... vmware xbox edition !?!?
2016-02-24 14:46:56	PrincessKnoeki	dugz: I've only just set up the filesystems :') I'm not that far yet
2016-02-24 14:47:09	+zlg	FrostFeline: haha
2016-02-24 14:47:22	+zlg	Thankfully there's nothing on those systems I'm interested in
2016-02-24 14:47:28	FrostFeline	I would like to see every console move to x86
2016-02-24 14:47:44	FrostFeline	In the future, it would be really nice to not have to write dynarecs any more.
2016-02-24 14:47:57	+zlg	Why migrate them to an aging and bloated instruction set?
2016-02-24 14:48:23	FrostFeline	Well, not necessarily x86, per se, that just happens to be popular right now.
2016-02-24 14:49:02	+zlg	I would expect each console to use what they think would be the best for the job. x86 has been popular for years, but we don't know what the future will hold. I'm sure all these emulators that run on x86 asm will need porting in the future.
2016-02-24 14:49:27	FrostFeline	Not if x86 desktops continue to be available.
2016-02-24 14:49:48	FrostFeline	It could stay around as the legacy option.
2016-02-24 14:49:52	PrincessKnoeki	zlg: some of them are silly anyway
2016-02-24 14:49:53	+zlg	Right, but ARM is gaining market/mindshare
2016-02-24 14:50:09	FrostFeline	Fortunately, all of those emulators usually have C cores built in.
2016-02-24 14:50:10	+zlg	ARM may end up being the future. It could be anything :P
2016-02-24 14:50:17	+zlg	FrostFeline: that's good news.
2016-02-24 14:50:21	PrincessKnoeki	yeah

2016-02-24 14:50:35	PrincessKnoeki	a lot of the ones that do use ASM are pretty old and outdated
2016-02-24 14:50:55	PrincessKnoeki	I mean, I'm not saying zsnes is a bad emulator per se, but it's not necessarily accurate (:
2016-02-24 14:51:09	FrostFeline	zsnes is also very buggy.
2016-02-24 14:51:12	+zlg	Honestly bsnes is probably the only accurate one :P
2016-02-24 14:51:29	+zlg	But as a result it has ridiculous requirements.
2016-02-24 14:51:34	FrostFeline	SNES9x is pretty good about accuracy.
2016-02-24 14:51:50	+zlg	I use whatever's built into mednafen.
2016-02-24 14:51:51	FrostFeline	It's no bsnes, but your games will work properly for the most part.
2016-02-24 14:52:07	PrincessKnoeki	FrostFeline: yes, that seems to be the target for most emulators
2016-02-24 14:52:12	PrincessKnoeki	"let's just make the games work whatever"
2016-02-24 14:52:22	PrincessKnoeki	rather than actually emulating the hardware properly
2016-02-24 14:52:24	FrostFeline	Which is perfectly fine.
2016-02-24 14:52:31	PrincessKnoeki	I disagree (:
2016-02-24 14:52:39	+zlg	unless you're writing homebrew designed for the system itself.
2016-02-24 14:52:40	FrostFeline	Nobody uses those game consoles for anything but playing games anymore.
2016-02-24 14:52:47	FrostFeline	The hardware is completely obsolete.
2016-02-24 14:52:50	PrincessKnoeki	or writing homebrew for them.
2016-02-24 14:52:54	PrincessKnoeki	demos, etc.
2016-02-24 14:53:23	FrostFeline	You're talking about a tiny minority. Compared to the people that just play games on emulators.
2016-02-24 14:53:47	PrincessKnoeki	yes, but even then, bsnes did a couple things right that no other emulator did.
2016-02-24 14:53:47		[14:53]
2016-02-24 14:54:01	+zlg	That makes me wonder...
2016-02-24 14:54:05	FrostFeline	Yes, bsnes has emulators for a few co-processors that no emulators did.
2016-02-24 14:54:09	+zlg	did he ever reverse engineer the superfx chip?
2016-02-24 14:54:18	*	PrincessKnoeki shrugs
2016-02-24 14:54:25	+zlg	if so, Star Fox might get proper emulation.
2016-02-24 14:54:35	+zlg	No emulator I know of can pull off Star Fox correctly.
2016-02-24 14:54:38	FrostFeline	 StairFax doesn't already have that?
2016-02-24 14:54:41	+zlg	The timing's all off.
2016-02-24 14:54:42	FrostFeline	What's wrong with it?
2016-02-24 14:55:05	PrincessKnoeki	if starfox runs at more than maybe 20fps in your emulator it's not accurate :D
2016-02-24 14:55:23	FrostFeline	or you're overclocking ;)
2016-02-24 14:55:24	+zlg	Intro scene with "SCRAMBLE" processes too quickly, and the game runs slightly too fast.
2016-02-24 14:55:24	PrincessKnoeki	maybe 20fps is too generous. the game is very slow (:
2016-02-24 14:55:42	+zlg	Yeah, Star Fox is very slideshowy compared to today's games.
2016-02-24 14:55:45	fs0ciety	yeah its more like 15fps
2016-02-24 14:55:45	PrincessKnoeki	FrostFeline: I have considered doing overclocking on my N64.
2016-02-24 14:55:49	FrostFeline	Can't you turn down the emulator speed in the main game?
2016-02-24 14:55:51	PrincessKnoeki	zlg: nah, it's not super bad.
2016-02-24 14:56:10	fs0ciety	i have an n64 game called hybrid heaven that supports the 8mb expansion.. once you enable it the game goes to 640x480 and runs at 10fps
2016-02-24 14:56:11	fs0ciety	hahaha
2016-02-24 14:56:14	+zlg	FrostFeline: That wouldn't fix the sound, which is my primary issue with it.
2016-02-24 14:56:15	FrostFeline	I've never played starfox on the snes so I have no comparison.
2016-02-24 14:56:17	PrincessKnoeki	if you want a true slideshow example, go play goldeneye (n64). or even worse, perfect dark (also n64)
2016-02-24 14:56:25	PrincessKnoeki	I'm pretty sure most of perfect dark is 10fps
2016-02-24 14:56:30	+zlg	I have very vivid memories of how the game is supposed to run, timings, etc.
2016-02-24 14:56:33	FrostFeline	How is goldeneye a slideshow?
2016-02-24 14:56:39	PrincessKnoeki	go ahead and play it
2016-02-24 14:56:43	PrincessKnoeki	on a real n64
2016-02-24 14:56:44	PrincessKnoeki	(:
2016-02-24 14:56:45	+zlg	So when an emulator fails to get timings correct, it bothers me.
2016-02-24 14:56:53	FrostFeline	What framerate does it play at?
2016-02-24 14:57:01	FrostFeline	I have an n64 but no goldeneye.

2016-02-24 14:57:16	PrincessKnoeki	FrostFeline: 15fps tops
2016-02-24 14:57:27	+zlg	fs0ciety: Welcome to N64 emulation.
2016-02-24 14:57:35	+zlg	Even Project64 on Windows is finicky.
2016-02-24 14:57:51	FrostFeline	zlg: Isn't n64 emulation so bad because of some commercial project?
2016-02-24 14:57:51	fs0ciety	ive been meaning to test resident evil 2 n64 version
2016-02-24 14:57:57	+zlg	No emu handles Jet Force Gemini correctly, since it worked extensively with the framebuffer.
2016-02-24 14:58:01	+zlg	Lots of hacks.
2016-02-24 14:58:06	+zlg	FrostFeline: dunno
2016-02-24 14:58:10	FrostFeline	I find PS1 emulation almost perfect.
2016-02-24 14:58:21	+zlg	PS1 emulation does seem rather good.
2016-02-24 14:58:22	FrostFeline	As long as you use software gpu emulation.
2016-02-24 14:58:29	+zlg	Everything I throw at it works.
2016-02-24 14:58:34	+zlg	And looks good.
2016-02-24 14:58:51	+zlg	Symphony of the Night's the only game I need for that anyway though :p
2016-02-24 14:59:35	+zlg	I remember playing that on epsxe on my ancient pentium 3 machine that had maybe 64 MB of VRAM
2016-02-24 14:59:43	+zlg	I got maybe 10-20 fps
2016-02-24 14:59:53	FrostFeline	for a game as popular as jet force gemini why hasn't the game been patched to render correctly?
2016-02-24 15:00:13	+zlg	FrostFeline: Dunno. Something to do with the way it handles zone markers and the HUD.
2016-02-24 15:00:49	+zlg	The game renders mostly correctly, but zone markers being red or green is a pretty big deal in the game to help you navigate and they often just don't change color like they should.

2016-02-24 15:01:17	PrincessKnoeki	because you don't patch games
2016-02-24 15:01:20	PrincessKnoeki	you fix the emulator
2016-02-24 15:02:11	+zlg	From what I understand, Rare messed around with the framebuffer a lot to squeeze performance out of the N64 for that game, and whatever trick they used, current emulators don't pick up on it.
2016-02-24 15:02:45	+zlg	I'm not sure how difficult it would be to find the code or whatever that handles it.
2016-02-24 15:02:51	FrostFeline	I guess there's no-one with the skills and interest to fix it.
2016-02-24 15:02:56	+zlg	The 64 only has 4 MB of RAM though, so there's only so much to trawl through
2016-02-24 15:03:06	FrostFeline	Mupen hasn't been patched in forever.
2016-02-24 15:04:27	PrincessKnoeki	zlg: that's still a lot of assembly to crawl through :P

2016-02-24 15:05:23	+zlg	I'm not sure if N64 games were written in asm though
2016-02-24 15:05:36	PrincessKnoeki	that doesn't matter when you're looking at the memory
2016-02-24 15:05:44	PrincessKnoeki	it's all going to be hex/binary
2016-02-24 15:05:44	+zlg	ah, true.

2016-02-24 15:06:02	+zlg	And given it's red/green, it's likely a single bit controlling it
2016-02-24 15:06:33	+zlg	So you'd have to find the correct bit and then what part of the ROM is acting on said bit
2016-02-24 15:06:56	PrincessKnoeki	well, it's not extremely difficult in theory
2016-02-24 15:07:13	PrincessKnoeki	you just need a tool that monitors the memory and watches for bytes that change at a certain time

2016-02-24 15:07:49	PrincessKnoeki	and then analyze the difference, yes.
2016-02-24 15:07:51	+zlg	That would narrow things down a lot; kinda like building a Gameshark code

2016-02-24 15:33:07	FrostFeline	PrincessKnoeki: Has your brother tried using an upscaler for his composite inputes?
2016-02-24 15:33:26	PrincessKnoeki	he doesn't use them
2016-02-24 15:33:28	PrincessKnoeki	I do.
2016-02-24 15:33:31	PrincessKnoeki	at least
2016-02-24 15:33:35	PrincessKnoeki	once, we needed it for a thing
2016-02-24 15:34:00	FrostFeline	I'll have to try my elgato now that I've got a component cable for my wii.
2016-02-24 15:34:17	FrostFeline	Maybe it won't have the colorspace problem with YPbPr
2016-02-24 15:34:33	FrostFeline	The elgato game capture software itself is poop tho >>
2016-02-24 15:35:07	FrostFeline	It uses most of 2 threads to stream hardware compressed h264 video.
2016-02-24 15:35:27	FrostFeline	(the dongle does the compression)
2016-02-24 15:35:35	dugz	you can't pluck a bushel full of back-bacon with the dullest knife in the drawer
2016-02-24 15:35:52	FrostFeline	OBS using intel quicksync uses 25% of one thread streaming live.
2016-02-24 15:36:11	FrostFeline	and that's with the uncompressed capture card running at 720p60
2016-02-24 15:36:40	FrostFeline	Miiiight be better on windows if you have a shadowplay card.

2016-02-24 15:37:32	FrostFeline	No quicktime drivers for mac.
2016-02-24 15:38:26	FrostFeline	PrincessKnoeki: userspace linux drivers https://github.com/tolga9009/elgato-gchd
2016-02-24 15:38:56	PrincessKnoeki	FrostFeline: ok? (:
2016-02-24 15:39:04	PrincessKnoeki	my brother isn't running linux on his desktop
2016-02-24 15:39:19	FrostFeline	Using an elgato on linux is cool :)
2016-02-24 15:39:26	FrostFeline	You could use it with your laptop or w/e

2016-02-24 16:49:47	Tatsh	some 4k monitors are cheaper than 2k (2560x1600) at same size or higher
2016-02-24 16:50:08	Tatsh	the cheaper ones are usually brands you never heard of; sometimes those work out well
2016-02-24 16:50:24	Tatsh	i have 2 40" oCOSMO brand TVs (1080p) and they work great
