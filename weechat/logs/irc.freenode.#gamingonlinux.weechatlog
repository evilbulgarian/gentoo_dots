2016-01-21 12:47:56	fs0ciety	i should try it again, was on arch at the time. now on funtoo
2016-01-21 12:48:08	fs0ciety	ram isn't an issue here. 32gb of ram.. be good to actually use it

2016-01-21 12:57:33	stqn	haha you’ll break your install day one ;)

2016-01-21 13:00:00	fs0ciety	dreamtiki: You're best bet is to compile a new kernel with the default arch .config and adding the amd drivers under --> device drivers when you run sudo make menuconfig

2016-01-21 15:13:15	gnarface	i seem to be having this problem: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=639876
2016-01-21 15:13:26	gnarface	but it affects more than just keyboards on encrypted setups
2016-01-21 15:13:42	gnarface	it also affects if you're booting from usb or reiserfs (maybe just both?)
2016-01-21 15:14:57	gnarface	and the workaround of using modules=most instead of modules=dep isn't acceptable because it triples the already very slow boot time from cheap usb flash keys

2016-01-21 19:56:53	Ysblokje	so did the upstream guy
2016-01-21 19:57:26	Ysblokje	with mercurial I would just hg pull <otherrepourl>  and do some rebase or merge
2016-01-21 19:57:51	Ysblokje	What is the workflow with git for that?
2016-01-21 19:58:08	Ysblokje	I tried some examples from the net but I must be missing something
2016-01-21 19:58:29	Ysblokje	because none of it is showing up in my code
2016-01-21 19:58:33	bazukas	git pull upstream_remote branch
2016-01-21 20:00:33	bazukas	git remote add upstream_remote https://github.com/user/repo.git, if you don't have that remote added

2016-01-21 20:23:32	Ysblokje	I just needed to add the remote
2016-01-21 20:23:42	Ysblokje	I thought it would be automatic since it was a clone
2016-01-21 20:23:45	Ysblokje	silly me
2016-01-21 20:30:47	homerj	git gets goofy
2016-01-21 20:31:02	homerj	there's a method to the madness, but sometimes it's just "ok, what exactly do I need to do here"

2016-01-21 20:50:24	homerj	Ysblokje, there is a hg-git gateway for github, so you can use hg
2016-01-21 20:50:25	homerj	I've never TRIED it, but it's there

2016-01-21 20:55:13	homerj	segfault?
2016-01-21 20:55:17	Ysblokje	nope
2016-01-21 20:55:32	homerj	there a repo somewhere?
2016-01-21 20:56:01	Ysblokje	most the application works just fine. but it needs to respond to some commands, and I think it tries to but I see nothing being replied
2016-01-21 20:56:05	Ysblokje	not yet
2016-01-21 20:56:25	Ysblokje	Its ugly as hell code

2016-01-21 20:56:43	homerj	put it up somewhere, I'll have a look

2016-01-22 01:02:07	Mneuro	if you use Gallium Nine you have to have an AMD card right?

2016-01-22 01:02:36	FutureSuture	Mneuro, correct.
2016-01-22 01:03:06	Mneuro	Wouldn't that hinder native game performance though

2016-01-22 01:06:31	Mneuro	I really only do native gaming on linux
2016-01-22 01:06:44	Mneuro	I used to mess with wine, but it's just better to have a dual boot if you are going to play windows games
2016-01-22 01:06:47	FutureSuture	kon14, check the links. Gallium Nine might as well be AMD exclusive.
2016-01-22 01:06:51	EddDeDuck	Native gaming on Linux I’d always reccomend Nvidia
2016-01-22 01:07:19	kon14	FutureSuture: which one? the gol article?
2016-01-22 01:07:25	kon14	i just connected btw
2016-01-22 01:07:26	FutureSuture	kon14, both links.
2016-01-22 01:07:41	FutureSuture	Both were posted after you joined.
2016-01-22 01:08:32	kon14	i mean, are those related to gallium_nine not working on nouveau?
2016-01-22 01:08:46	FutureSuture	kon14, yea.
2016-01-22 01:08:53	FutureSuture	The benchmarks include Nouveau.
2016-01-22 01:09:05	kon14	nouveau is gallium driver isn't it?
2016-01-22 01:09:18	kon14	in the gallium architecture or whatever

2016-01-22 01:11:34	FutureSuture	I did
2016-01-22 01:11:38	kon14	and afaik it works on nouveau
2016-01-22 01:12:06	FutureSuture	In those benchmarks, it worked in 1 out of 5 benchmarks.

2016-01-22 01:13:51	FutureSuture	Holy poo is the performance bad in your links.

2016-01-22 01:14:36	kon14	there's a difference between something being exclusie to X and performanc/support being bad on Y
2016-01-22 01:14:47	FutureSuture	kon14, all I can say is that it worked 5 out of 5 times for AMD in those benchmarks, and 1 out of 5 times for Nouveau
2016-01-22 01:15:03	FutureSuture	kon14, that is why I said it might as well be exclusive.
2016-01-22 01:15:14	kon14	got it now
2016-01-22 01:15:36	kon14	should have read it anew before

2016-01-22 05:58:49	qptain_Nemo	well i mean, it really depends
2016-01-22 05:58:50	Bronsky	qptain_Nemo: I was also joking, but to be honest it's not a question of patience. When the next act takes that long I rather not play or I get lazy to start the new one
2016-01-22 05:59:01	Bronsky	so if I want to play the entire game I have to wait
2016-01-22 06:00:20	qptain_Nemo	you mean you lose the drive for playing it?
2016-01-22 06:01:51	Bronsky	something inside me knows that I will not play the entire game so I lost the appeal to play it until it's complete

2016-01-22 06:36:05	FutureSuture	calexil, I found it easier to learn than League of Legends
2016-01-22 06:36:05	calexil	counterstrike
2016-01-22 06:36:13	calexil	I mean its easy to learn
2016-01-22 06:36:16	FutureSuture	But yes, I've quit DOTA2, and multiplayer only games in general.
2016-01-22 06:36:17	calexil	but hard to master
2016-01-22 06:36:24	calexil	like chess
2016-01-22 06:36:38	FutureSuture	Left 4 Dead, as it turns out, isn't for me either, despite having a singleplayer mode.
2016-01-22 06:36:39	GermainZ	so is dota really
2016-01-22 06:36:46	FutureSuture	It's got no story.
2016-01-22 06:36:58	GermainZ	the only learning curve is "learn the key bindings"

2016-01-22 06:51:21	FutureSuture	But I digress.
2016-01-22 06:51:46	FutureSuture	SuperTuxKart and 0 A.D. will help with the multiplayer needs, but the former has no online multiplayer yet and the latter is too incomplete.
2016-01-22 06:52:13	FutureSuture	drumr, some do, some don't, but when a game is gratis, there is no barrier to entry, really.
2016-01-22 06:53:00	FutureSuture	I myself am not keen on spending money on multiplayer games again.

2016-01-22 06:55:51	@Samsai	could very well be that they packed their things and left for greener pastures and more populated games
2016-01-22 06:55:59	FutureSuture	Evolve seems to have flopped in terms of sales.

2016-01-22 06:56:41	@Samsai	initial sales were okay-ish, then the player base fell and the word about the game dying started spreading
2016-01-22 06:56:50	@Samsai	and when people assumed the game died, it died
2016-01-22 06:56:50	FutureSuture	Would Feral be able to just get up and leave? Surely they invested time and money into porting the game before release.
2016-01-22 06:56:50	GermainZ	then it died
2016-01-22 06:57:15	drumr	true
2016-01-22 06:57:31	@Samsai	FutureSuture, keep in mind the PR risk involved with releasing the port

2016-01-22 06:58:59	FutureSuture	It took DOTA2 to see the futility in multiplayer only games.
2016-01-22 06:59:03	FutureSuture	Another reason to only buy games with solid singleplayer campaigns. You don't need to rely on anyone else. <3

2016-01-22 08:23:54	FutureSuture	Also, NaughtySquid, I've been wondering. Aspyr and Feral are the publishers of their Linux and Mac OS ports, correct? Couldn't Aspyr and Feral bring their ports to GOG, even if the Windows clients are not there yet?
2016-01-22 08:24:16	qptain_Nemo	what an interesting point
2016-01-22 08:24:26	FutureSuture	qptain_Nemo, quite so.
2016-01-22 08:24:28	qptain_Nemo	i wouldn't be surprised if gog itself turned them down though :(
2016-01-22 08:24:44	FutureSuture	GOG can go FUDGE itself then.
2016-01-22 08:24:45	qptain_Nemo	cdpr/gog are still clearly very windows-centric
2016-01-22 08:24:51	FutureSuture	Apologies for the language.
2016-01-22 08:25:07	qptain_Nemo	wow, FutureSuture. so fucking rude.

2016-01-22 08:25:37	FutureSuture	Yea, every Linux user seems to think DRM free gaming and Linux/open source software go hand in hand. Only GOG seems to disagree.
2016-01-22 08:25:52	qptain_Nemo	but yeah, it's just my hypothetical assumption. maybe they wouldn't.
2016-01-22 08:26:09	toor_xunil	DRM free gaming and open source software?
2016-01-22 08:26:10	toor_xunil	nah
2016-01-22 08:26:14	drumr	maybe there needs to be a third player in the ports business
2016-01-22 08:26:17	toor_xunil	nobody thinks that
2016-01-22 08:26:35	drumr	i would be offering to port older stuff
2016-01-22 08:26:47	FutureSuture	toor_xunil, I cannot tell if that was sarcasm or not.
2016-01-22 08:26:52	qptain_Nemo	night dive studios port some of their stuff
2016-01-22 08:26:55	qptain_Nemo	iirc
2016-01-22 08:27:08	@NaughtySquid	it depends
2016-01-22 08:27:20	toor_xunil	FutureSuture, dude… if they do… that's weird… it really has nothing to do with open source the fact there is no DRM
2016-01-22 08:27:23	@NaughtySquid	on what gog require and what the original developer and publisher sign off on
2016-01-22 08:27:36	@NaughtySquid	aspyr/feral may only be getting the rights to publish on steam
2016-01-22 08:27:43	@NaughtySquid	a different store would be a different contract
2016-01-22 08:28:02	toor_xunil	it's like saying "freeware" are related to open source, because open source softwares are usually free
2016-01-22 08:28:31	FutureSuture	toor_xunil, I can try and find said people's arguments on GOG. Something about software freedom and what not; being able to do what you want with said software.
2016-01-22 08:28:51	drumr	meh
2016-01-22 08:28:58	drumr	oh you mean zealots
2016-01-22 08:29:38	qptain_Nemo	i wonder if steam lets you publish linux-exclusive games. does anyone know by any chance?
2016-01-22 08:30:24	vidje	why wouldn't they? Oo
2016-01-22 08:30:36	vidje	if you can publish windows exclusives, why couldn't you linux exclusives?
2016-01-22 08:31:31	FutureSuture	Ugh, can't find any significant statements on the matter now.
2016-01-22 08:31:55	drumr	so can you put a game up if your small and not go through greenlight?
2016-01-22 08:32:01	vidje	tbh don't think valve cares as long as they get their money
2016-01-22 08:32:15	drumr	i think if people would put out games linux exclusive for the first couple months you would get some interesting reactions
2016-01-22 08:32:18	FutureSuture	But yea, if anything, I associate DRM free more with Linux/open source software than DRM.
2016-01-22 08:32:26	drumr	lo yeah that was going to be my first reaction
2016-01-22 08:32:48	FutureSuture	You can't publish Linux only games. It's against Valve's TOS as far as I recall.
2016-01-22 08:33:17	qptain_Nemo	FutureSuture: i wish you had a source but thanks anyway
2016-01-22 08:33:22	vidje	discriminatory TOS then
2016-01-22 08:34:03	@NaughtySquid	there is a linux-only game on steam atm

2016-01-22 08:37:21	qptain_Nemo	> To remain in Steam Greenlight and qualify for distribution via Steam, your game must at least run on a Windows PC.
2016-01-22 08:38:10	qptain_Nemo	(i actually think crossplatforminess is a better tactic but this is still not very cool)
2016-01-22 08:38:46	vidje	but not all games need to be in greenlight, yes?
2016-01-22 08:39:04	qptain_Nemo	pretty much all games, yes
2016-01-22 08:39:11	vidje	hm ok
2016-01-22 08:39:11	FutureSuture	qptain_Nemo, oh, did you mean a source for one's game needing to have a Windows client?
2016-01-22 08:39:12	qptain_Nemo	unless you have a massive AAA publisher or won an award
2016-01-22 08:39:32	qptain_Nemo	FutureSuture: uh, sorry?
2016-01-22 08:39:50	qptain_Nemo	i just meant a windows release available in the steam store?
2016-01-22 08:40:07	FutureSuture	[21:32:47] <FutureSuture> You can't publish Linux only games. It's against Valve's TOS as far as I recall.
2016-01-22 08:40:07	FutureSuture	[21:33:17] <qptain_Nemo> FutureSuture: i wish you had a source but thanks anyway
2016-01-22 08:40:22	qptain_Nemo	ah yes
2016-01-22 08:40:46	FutureSuture	Gave you a source for the GOG claim when you could have meant the Steam claim.
2016-01-22 08:40:57	qptain_Nemo	yeah i meant steam, sorry if i was vague

2016-01-22 08:41:24	qptain_Nemo	but i pretty much found the steam one as you can see
2016-01-22 08:42:03	FutureSuture	Yea
2016-01-22 08:42:46	FutureSuture	So even if SteamOS takes off, every game will still need to have a Windows client.
2016-01-22 08:44:00	qptain_Nemo	seeing westwood titles on the gog wishlist makes me sad
2016-01-22 08:44:13	qptain_Nemo	giving more money to EA who shut down westwood :(
2016-01-22 08:44:34	FutureSuture	I guess I'll make you sad as well, qptain_Nemo. Which games did Westwood do?
2016-01-22 08:45:30	qptain_Nemo	they're most famous for their strategy series Dune and Command and Conquer, Red Alert in particular. but they also did some other interesting stuff such as adventure games Circuit's Edge, Legend of Kyrandia, Blade Runner and action RPG series Lands of Lore
2016-01-22 08:46:27	qptain_Nemo	i'm super biased but i almost see Lands of Lore 2 as the witcher of its time. it was really damn cool

2016-01-24 13:26:04	tadzik	from what I understand from his, quoting "goofy ass shit" and "funky ass macro", the function he calls is a macro that generates multiple functions
2016-01-24 13:26:40	Smilex	Oh yeah. I do the same. Basically you define the function signature once, then call the function macro to sync that signature across files

2016-01-24 13:30:21	tadzik	huh
2016-01-24 13:31:11	Smilex	the benefit is that I need the function signature can be reused both for declaring a function, and for function pointers
2016-01-24 13:32:13	tadzik	fair enough
2016-01-24 13:32:23	tadzik	I've never seen this trick before, interesting

2016-01-24 13:48:03	tadzik	so, there was a lot of hype about how "now we can write once and it runs everywhere, no platform specific stuff"
2016-01-24 13:48:33	tadzik	so people say that during their presentation, then 20 slides later they say "well, eventually we had to abandon the iOS port because of the incompatibilities and had to settle for just android"
2016-01-24 13:48:49	tadzik	and at the end again: "we're happy to choose html5 because of the portability, bla bla bla"

2016-01-24 13:50:32	tadzik	now that I think of it, it's hardly related :)
2016-01-24 13:50:58	tadzik	but it amuses me inside every time a cross platform stuff gets brought up
2016-01-24 13:51:55	tadzik	as for C (or Seeples), I don't even have hope
2016-01-24 13:54:46	Smilex	Yeah. I got burnt quite badly by the HTML5 portability promise

2016-02-07 08:02:37	@NaughtySquid	it's a fucking useless benchmark
2016-02-07 08:02:41	@NaughtySquid	if he did it on low/medium
2016-02-07 08:02:49	@NaughtySquid	and one on 720p too
2016-02-07 08:02:53	@NaughtySquid	now that would be useful

2016-02-07 08:10:02	@Samsai	but nobody in their right mind will play on ultra with a 710

2016-02-07 08:17:51	Half-Shot	TL;DR anything less than the 60's from Nvidia is worthless because current gen IGPUs are about as powerful as the lesser cards if you configure it right

2016-02-07 08:25:56	mirv_	also, good evening
2016-02-07 08:26:13	Raven67854	mirv_, Yeah for zen APU's. AMD is currently testing and some might make it this year to see if its worthwhile
2016-02-07 08:26:20	Raven67854	Dedicated HBM for the APU
2016-02-07 08:26:50	@Samsai	that would make sense
2016-02-07 08:27:00	Raven67854	Yeah
2016-02-07 08:27:13	Raven67854	But costs can be an issue also you need space on the mobo for it
2016-02-07 08:27:16	@Samsai	some games get bogged down by the RAM speed and you don't necessarily want to buy gamer grade RAM straight from AMD
2016-02-07 08:27:33	Raven67854	Skylakes are DDR4 and AMD zen will be ddr4
2016-02-07 08:27:41	Raven67854	So ram speed should be less and less of an issue

2016-02-07 08:33:17	drumr	well it did use amd again for quite a while
2016-02-07 08:33:23	@Samsai	it barely works with ubuntu
2016-02-07 08:33:41	mirv_	mesa, on the other hand, just works with everything
2016-02-07 08:33:42	drumr	i was always mad because i had amd and all my friends nvidia was so much better with performance
2016-02-07 08:33:54	drumr	im talking 98-2005
2016-02-07 08:34:17	Smilex	drumr: you were always mad for 7 years?
2016-02-07 08:34:18	depingus	Hopefully amdgpu helps.
2016-02-07 08:34:30	mirv_	I think we're at the point where most people should be using mesa over fglrx
2016-02-07 08:34:39	drumr	no im talking about the gpus i had
2016-02-07 08:34:40	@Samsai	depingus, can't be worse so it likely does
2016-02-07 08:34:45	Smilex	drumr: I'm kidding
2016-02-07 08:34:46	drumr	it didnt game all that often
2016-02-07 08:34:56	drumr	it was always andissue when i did and back then it wasnt the cost
2016-02-07 08:35:06	@Samsai	mirv_, based on GOL's surveys most AMD users do
2016-02-07 08:35:15	depingus	i was on mesa but XCOM2 was having a terrible time. fglrx helped some. SOME. XC2 is still a mess of a game.
2016-02-07 08:35:15	drumr	i know but man was it annoying
2016-02-07 08:35:29	GermainZ	vidje: why are you asking me?
2016-02-07 08:35:43	@Samsai	at least feral is sorting out the AMD issues
2016-02-07 08:35:57	@Samsai	hopefully we'll see a performance patch soon
2016-02-07 08:35:59	Smilex	So The Revenant is basically Bear Grylls
2016-02-07 08:36:04	Smilex	basically about *
2016-02-07 08:36:17	depingus	That's what I heard. I know its opening weekend. So I'm holding off. Do you know if the AMD patch is for fglrx or for mesa?
2016-02-07 08:36:26	mirv_	Samsai, I like how there are reports of XCOM2 running better under Linux
2016-02-07 08:36:44	@Samsai	mirv_, i don't think it runs better on linux anymore
2016-02-07 08:36:57	@Samsai	i think the windows version already got a patch that helps a bit
2016-02-07 08:36:59	vidje	GermainZ, i saw your name is on that github

2016-02-07 08:37:12	@Samsai	depingus, feral is working quite closely with the mesa drivers
2016-02-07 08:37:12	depingus	ive played the first 2 missions. its playable.
2016-02-07 08:37:25	mirv_	btw, where is FutureSuture when you need him?
2016-02-07 08:37:35	@Samsai	depingus, with grid we saw them prioritize mesa over crimson
2016-02-07 08:37:37	vidje	GermainZ, your name is on the readme.md stating it's a collection if scripts among which you've coded some yourself
2016-02-07 08:37:56	depingus	i heard the mesa drivers might work better in XC2. hopefully this is the case.
2016-02-07 08:38:04	GermainZ	vidje: correct. Now read what you've just said again, and explain to me how that makes me the person to ask for support with any script in the repo?
2016-02-07 08:38:15	vidje	i asked if you know
2016-02-07 08:38:23	@Samsai	depingus, at the moment there's a marginal visual improvement if you use mesa
2016-02-07 08:38:30	vidje	as it could've well been your script in there
2016-02-07 08:38:32	@Samsai	performance is slightly worse though
2016-02-07 08:38:34	hidekin	i tried xcom 2 on linux and windows , on linux i'm on medium at 40fps , on windows i'm on high at 50fps with a gtx 770. I hope they patch the game

2016-02-07 08:39:12	vidje	ye np it's not working for some reason anyway
2016-02-07 08:39:26	GermainZ	vidje: hexchat has an IRC channel, maybe try that
2016-02-07 08:39:45	depingus	mine was unplayable in mesa. Dropping to 1 FPS during action mode. With catalyst i only drop to like 15.
2016-02-07 08:39:59	vidje	ye did long time ago, no worries, fixing it
2016-02-07 08:40:14	@Samsai	depingus, it starts out absolutely terrible
2016-02-07 08:40:29	GermainZ	then it becomes just terrible \o/
2016-02-07 08:40:33	@Samsai	but over time the performance starts to level down
2016-02-07 08:41:08	depingus	Hope a patch comes soon. I took monday off (post superbowl hangover) so maybe i get lucky! Would be nice to spend a day off playing XC.
2016-02-07 08:41:08	@Samsai	the game definitely wasn't great on mesa though

2016-02-07 08:57:10	drumr	still decent

2016-02-07 08:57:52	Ysblokje	RTS offering along those lines has been pretty slim

2016-02-08 21:52:29	EddDeDuck	That betting in tennis news story
2016-02-08 21:52:49	EddDeDuck	which turned out to be way less sensational when you looked at the actual facts

2016-02-08 21:56:22	FutureSuture	Then that article about Steam Machines sucking came out
2016-02-08 21:56:24	Half-Shot	I used to think they were acceptable
2016-02-08 21:56:34	Half-Shot	Yeah, that changed my opinion

2016-02-08 21:57:21	Half-Shot	Cause you can't technically fault it, Windows would have been alright with that monitor
2016-02-08 21:57:29	Half-Shot	It's just...stupid
2016-02-08 21:58:00	Half-Shot	I always maintain the Steam Machines are just a console running Linux, as a product.
2016-02-08 21:58:14	Half-Shot	So don't expect it to do non console things, just be pleased when it can.
2016-02-08 21:59:45	Half-Shot	I'd like them to take off, just so we can have a return of homebrew software.
2016-02-08 22:00:17	EddDeDuck	How will a Steam box help with homebrew?
2016-02-08 22:00:34	Half-Shot	Potential for custom skins, mods to the system.
2016-02-08 22:01:03	EddDeDuck	I can’t see how that will be more likely with SteamOS on a Steam machine in a living room.
2016-02-08 22:01:33	Half-Shot	Oh extremely. Same way that android has allowed us to put whatever on our phones.
2016-02-08 22:01:35	EddDeDuck	People who want homebrew usually don’t fit into the console market.
2016-02-08 22:02:10	FutureSuture	What I like about Steam Machines is that there now is more hardware that one can buy with Linux preinstalled. Bought myself a Steam Machine just to install Antergos on it and managed to count as a Linux sale.
2016-02-08 22:02:12	EddDeDuck	Same thing with Android vast % of Android users who have anything custom outside of the options built in in very small.
2016-02-08 22:02:27	Half-Shot	Yeah, it's not a majority thing.
2016-02-08 22:02:33	Half-Shot	But the option is there
2016-02-08 22:02:55	EddDeDuck	Sure it might be the hackable console
2016-02-08 22:03:18	EddDeDuck	but I don’t thnk it’s adding much more over Linux/Mac/WIndows in that regard
2016-02-08 22:03:45	Half-Shot	It's really the same thing as when I got Linux running on my PS2. The thing was old and obviously many times slower than my PC. But it was cool in it's own way.

2016-02-08 23:13:23	homerj	but I think that would be useful, I'm sure all over the world, a lot of people like their home radio commentary over the tv commentary
2016-02-08 23:13:59	homerj	especially when your game is national, and you get the network's "b-team" and you just want your own people calling the game

2016-02-08 23:32:35	xpander69	XCOM2 multiplayer seems pretty bad .. i mean delay between turns is just insane.. the longer you play the longer the delay
2016-02-08 23:32:51	xpander69	like i saw action on scree and my friend saw it like 30-40 sec later..and vice versa
2016-02-08 23:33:24	EddDeDuck	Yep seen that usually it’s when one machine is lagging hard or internet conx isn’t great
2016-02-08 23:33:33	EddDeDuck	We’ve reproduced with all three platforms

2016-02-09 01:42:10	Raven67854	Stop being broke
2016-02-09 01:42:14	DrMcCoy	I'm currently glad I can somewhat feed myself
2016-02-09 01:42:24	@NaughtySquid	Smilex: it would be a good idea to blast all the dust off your PSU and GPU fans
2016-02-09 01:42:26	@NaughtySquid	as well as case fans
2016-02-09 01:42:29	Raven67854	I'll stop by there today or tomorrow DrMcCoy..
2016-02-09 01:42:32	Raven67854	What GPU do you have?
2016-02-09 01:42:49	DrMcCoy	GeForce GT 630

2016-02-09 01:43:14	DrMcCoy	Well
2016-02-09 01:43:18	DrMcCoy	It's newer than my CPU
2016-02-09 01:43:23	Raven67854	That is true
2016-02-09 01:43:42	DrMcCoy	Which is an Athlon 64 X2, 6000+. Built in 2006, I believe
2016-02-09 01:43:51	Raven67854	The PC i'll be ripping that ram out of has a AMD Athlon 64 x2 6500+ black edition
2016-02-09 01:44:02	Raven67854	I loved that machine
2016-02-09 01:44:09	Raven67854	I played so much left 4 dead on it
2016-02-09 01:45:57	DrMcCoy	If you want to gift me a whole new desktop, I certainly wouldn't complain ;)
2016-02-09 01:47:00	FutureSuture	Someday, DrMcCoy. Someday.
2016-02-09 01:47:47	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, I am not that nice no :P
2016-02-09 01:49:38	FutureSuture	DrMcCoy, mirv_ has gifted NaughtySquid quite a few bits of hardware I believe.
2016-02-09 01:50:02	@Samsai	FutureSuture, don't sell other people's gifts
2016-02-09 01:50:31	DrMcCoy	Yeah, this is getting weird
2016-02-09 01:50:49	Raven67854	I bought my own hardware
2016-02-09 01:50:49	Raven67854	:P
2016-02-09 01:51:16	DrMcCoy	How square
2016-02-09 01:51:22	Raven67854	I know right!
2016-02-09 01:51:31	@Samsai	i had two old rigs but we sent both to a recycling center
2016-02-09 01:51:42	@Samsai	they were probably too crappy to be of any use anyway
2016-02-09 01:51:49	Raven67854	I have a hard time recycling hardware
2016-02-09 01:51:52	Raven67854	I just keep it :(
2016-02-09 01:51:58	Raven67854	I'm like maybe I'll need it someday!
2016-02-09 01:52:13	@Samsai	we just kinda dropped it off at the recycling center, they'll figure out what they can do with it
2016-02-09 01:52:15	Raven67854	Then people just give you that look. When will you need a 386 machine. YOU NEVER KNOW

2016-02-09 01:52:26	DrMcCoy	I recently threw away a system with a 486. The PSU was shot, though
2016-02-09 01:52:56	DrMcCoy	Still hurt like hell, throwing it away
2016-02-09 01:53:02	Raven67854	There there

2016-02-09 01:54:19	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, ha!
2016-02-09 01:54:23	Smilex	DrMcCoy: Oh you know about that
2016-02-09 01:54:57	DrMcCoy	The scary thing is that it makes sense. If you ignore the weird terminology

2016-02-09 02:05:55	linux_gamer	why is the delay so big?
2016-02-09 02:06:06	xpander69	linux_gamer, probably because of wifi?
2016-02-09 02:06:12	xpander69	didnt test usb tethering
2016-02-09 02:06:40	linux_gamer	mh, ok but it should be ~100ms or?
2016-02-09 02:06:52	xpander69	yeah..might be even bit more
2016-02-09 02:06:55	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, that might be fun
2016-02-09 02:07:10	linux_gamer	but a very cool idea
2016-02-09 02:07:17	xpander69	linux_gamer, someone somewhere said that enabling plane mode on phone will help to reduce lag
2016-02-09 02:07:22	xpander69	havent tried that either yet
2016-02-09 02:08:05	linux_gamer	interesting use of the gyro anyway
2016-02-09 02:08:11	@NaughtySquid	so
2016-02-09 02:08:17	xpander69	now i wonder if you can do same with steam controller :D
2016-02-09 02:08:19	@NaughtySquid	dying light enhanced edition & the following tomorrow
2016-02-09 02:08:23	xpander69	mounting it on top of your head :D
2016-02-09 02:08:26	linux_gamer	first thought it was optical
2016-02-09 02:09:12	linux_gamer	xpander69, were you able to config the steam controllers gyro for Grid?
2016-02-09 02:09:37	xpander69	linux_gamer, no idea..havent used..i feel that the steam controller has also some lag with gyro..wouldnt work in grid for me :D
2016-02-09 02:10:08	linux_gamer	im doing RR3 with the android gyro on my LG and its really nike
2016-02-09 02:10:11	Raven67854	Should be interesting to see if any Linux fixes are made :p
2016-02-09 02:11:05	xpander69	linux_gamer, no idea what RR3 is :)
2016-02-09 02:11:28	linux_gamer	its real racing 3, to bad its android and mac
2016-02-09 02:12:06	xpander69	linux_gamer, works with chrome also?
2016-02-09 02:12:10	xpander69	or need android really?
2016-02-09 02:12:31	linux_gamer	mh never tested anything but android

2016-02-09 02:16:48	linux_gamer	makes sense, but maybe shorten that a bit

2016-02-09 03:03:45	xpander69	itsa amazing!
2016-02-09 03:04:02	Smilex	xpander69: oh hello there Mario.
2016-02-09 03:04:05	xpander69	except the few framerate issue and multiplayer delay issues .D
2016-02-09 03:04:17	xpander69	Smilex, Mario? :D what
2016-02-09 03:04:58	Smilex	xpander69: _itsa_ me Mario.
2016-02-09 03:05:27	EddDeDuck	xpander69 you tried our beta update yet?
2016-02-09 03:05:35	xpander69	EddDeDuck, yes
2016-02-09 03:05:42	EddDeDuck	(y)
2016-02-09 03:06:00	xpander69	i think i reported back to you also that its smoother :)
2016-02-09 03:06:09	Huckert	I'm loving the game, despite how much the game seems to hate me. :(
2016-02-09 03:06:21	Half-Shot	Any point in mesa users trying the beta EddDeDuck? I'm not going to start it until I've completed XCOM, but good to know in advance.
2016-02-09 03:06:45	EddDeDuck	yeah mesa is pretty much shippable on AMD and Intel
2016-02-09 03:07:01	Half-Shot	I've started the game :P, ran better than expected.
2016-02-09 03:07:03	EddDeDuck	a few performance drops (which are mostly fixed in latets beta)
2016-02-09 03:07:32	EddDeDuck	We moved a few buffer calls for Mesa as it is slow using the standard method we use with other drivers
2016-02-09 03:07:41	EddDeDuck	It also imroves crimson
2016-02-09 03:07:50	EddDeDuck	which is also pretty good shape now
2016-02-09 03:08:42	EddDeDuck	Not supported (yet)
2016-02-09 03:08:55	xpander69	soon™
2016-02-09 03:09:13	EddDeDuck	How soon I don’t want to guess but we’re working on it
2016-02-09 03:10:05	Half-Shot	It's cool. I'm glad you're testing mesa :)
2016-02-09 03:10:52	Raven67854	Beta update is the only way to play xcom2
2016-02-09 03:10:59	Raven67854	Impossible to play without the beta. To much stuttering
2016-02-09 03:11:38	Raven67854	Good game though not sure how I feel about the turn timers on hard modes
2016-02-09 03:13:45	Raven67854	I like that they tried something to fix the camping overwatch sillyness. But the turn timers for every bit just seems like a meh way to go about it
2016-02-09 03:14:26	Huckert	Seeing as the "tables are turned" for this game there needs to be something to urge you forward imo
2016-02-09 03:14:51	Raven67854	Huckert, Have you played it ?
2016-02-09 03:15:07	Huckert	I have, and I am.
2016-02-09 03:15:18	Raven67854	some of the late missions are just a gigantic wtf on hard
2016-02-09 03:16:03	Huckert	Yeah :D
2016-02-09 03:16:29	Raven67854	Like not enough turns to get back after completion. Creates more frustration than it should. But eh overall it's a good game
2016-02-09 03:17:01	Huckert	Feels soooo good when you barely scrape through it though
2016-02-09 03:18:34	Huckert	Also starting to feel a lot better when I've played it a bit and I know what all the different things do

2016-02-09 03:28:36	xpander69	anonkun, ARK has a lot more content but is not a really good port performance wise.. Rust runs pretty good but less content and can break from time to time on the road for linux
2016-02-09 03:29:14	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:29:38	anonkun	well, can you recommend me some good games for linux? preferably online
2016-02-09 03:29:40	xpander69	so if you have GPU thats below x60 on nvidia side..just forget ARK
2016-02-09 03:29:49	anonkun	I havet a 750gtx ti
2016-02-09 03:29:51	xpander69	you also at least need 8GB memory for ARK
2016-02-09 03:29:56	anonkun	I do have 8GB ram
2016-02-09 03:30:02	xpander69	anonkun, then ARK wont be a smooth experience for you
2016-02-09 03:30:09	anonkun	hmm alright
2016-02-09 03:30:17	anonkun	I guess I wont get rust though
2016-02-09 03:30:26	xpander69	they want to add Vulkan as soon as UE4 becomes available with it..so that might help
2016-02-09 03:30:33	xpander69	but atm its pretty heavy on resources
2016-02-09 03:30:48	anonkun	well, then i'd rather buy it once its out with vulkan :)

2016-02-09 03:37:42	anonkun	or is it linux users vs linux users only
2016-02-09 03:37:45	anonkun	awesome
2016-02-09 03:37:57	anonkun	I hate CoH for keeping it linux vs linux only

2016-02-09 03:39:19	ezwdna	not so soon ...
2016-02-09 03:39:26	EddDeDuck	It’s not being “kept” Linux vs Linux
2016-02-09 03:39:36	EddDeDuck	It’s due to how the game is designed
2016-02-09 03:39:48	anonkun	I thought it was because they didn't make a native port or something
2016-02-09 03:40:02	EddDeDuck	nope it’s a native port
2016-02-09 03:40:05	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:40:08	anonkun	my bad then
2016-02-09 03:40:22	EddDeDuck	Our latest update expanded support to Mac vs Linux (the two platforms we develop on)
2016-02-09 03:40:53	anonkun	I loved the first CoH a lot
2016-02-09 03:40:55	anonkun	so got the second one
2016-02-09 03:41:00	anonkun	but didnt play much of it because of time etc
2016-02-09 03:41:16	anonkun	and also because I was unable to play with my friend, who uses windows
2016-02-09 03:41:28	xpander69	anonkun, linux is free:D
2016-02-09 03:41:29	anonkun	do you guys plan to keep the next iteration of CoH, if any, cross platform
2016-02-09 03:42:31	anonkun	xpander69: yeah, but my friend doesn't know how to use it and isn' willing. Plus it'll just cause him more trouble with partitioning etc.
2016-02-09 03:43:00	xpander69	you go and do it... buy him a cheap ssd for b-day ..install linux onto it :D
2016-02-09 03:43:12	anonkun	"cheap ssd" :PPP
2016-02-09 03:43:19	xpander69	ofc cheap
2016-02-09 03:43:27	anonkun	It's quite expensive where I live
2016-02-09 03:43:34	xpander69	cause if you buy expensive one..you will end up putting it into your machine :D
2016-02-09 03:43:39	xpander69	ahh ok :D
2016-02-09 03:43:56	anonkun	I plan on buying an SSD for myself first, eventually.
2016-02-09 03:44:00	anonkun	but i like your idea
2016-02-09 03:44:10	anonkun	buy a extra hard disk and gift it with linux
2016-02-09 03:44:35	anonkun	I could literally install it on my pc, then just plug the hard disk into friends pc ;P

2016-02-09 03:46:10	EddDeDuck	Yeah well we enabled Mac vs Linux but that was not simple (required replacement and debuging of a lot of stuff)
2016-02-09 03:47:19	anonkun	Well, thanks for the effort
2016-02-09 03:47:33	anonkun	but I get it, no one was expecting steamplay to be a thing
2016-02-09 03:48:10	EddDeDuck	Windows is possible but that would need WIndows side edits to enable all the chnages we did and debug any Windows specific things.
2016-02-09 03:48:40	EddDeDuck	It was a mutliple month task to get Mac vs Linux working so it’s not a make a few changes and compile thing :(
2016-02-09 03:48:50	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:48:58	EddDeDuck	That said XCOM 2 and GRID Autosport are examples of cross platform MP
2016-02-09 03:49:00	anonkun	so you guys working on the windows edits?
2016-02-09 03:49:13	anonkun	or is it too much effort for the results
2016-02-09 03:49:16	frankyboy_	anonkun, but 16gb ssd for os... and use harddrive for other stuff

2016-02-09 03:49:53	EddDeDuck	Nope you missed that we added Mac vs Linux support on CoH2
2016-02-09 03:49:54	anonkun	do you want a battle to be going on here?
2016-02-09 03:49:57	EddDeDuck	so it’s not per platform
2016-02-09 03:50:07	Smilex	Oh, cross platform multiplayer
2016-02-09 03:50:10	Smilex	that's cool!
2016-02-09 03:50:13	EddDeDuck	Windows is now the odd one out that doesn’t support cross platform

2016-02-09 05:32:45	anonkun	what is SC2?
2016-02-09 05:32:58	vidje	starcraft2
2016-02-09 05:33:04	anonkun	its on linux ? o.O
2016-02-09 05:33:04	vidje	NaughtySquid, ah i see
2016-02-09 05:33:15	vidje	anonkun, no no
2016-02-09 05:33:21	anonkun	aaah
2016-02-09 05:33:38	anonkun	I remember blizzard talking about porting "at least on major title" to linux
2016-02-09 05:33:40	anonkun	odd they havent
2016-02-09 05:33:45	@NaughtySquid	they never said that
2016-02-09 05:33:49	gnarface	anonkun: their stuff is all playable in wine though
2016-02-09 05:33:51	@NaughtySquid	that was Phoronix bollacks as usual
2016-02-09 05:33:53	Half-Shot	As a rule, I don't like showing my face unless it adds to the video. Jim Sterling does kinda have a huge dramatics thing going on.
2016-02-09 05:33:55	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, no need to admit anything
2016-02-09 05:33:59	@Samsai	it's so blatantly obvious

2016-02-09 08:20:46	gnarface	guest01348: wow runs *alright* if you've got a specially-patched up wine and a good enough cpu
2016-02-09 08:20:48	disharmonic	gnarface: I stopped actively reading slashdot several years ago
2016-02-09 08:21:13	guest01348	already tried wow heh
2016-02-09 08:21:28	gnarface	guest01348: its runs pretty crappy unless you have the CSMT patch from staging
2016-02-09 08:21:50	gnarface	guest01348: could be more trouble than its worth
2016-02-09 08:22:07	gnarface	guest01348: Shadowrun: Boston Lockdown is technically an MMO
2016-02-09 08:22:16	gnarface	guest01348: no wine required
2016-02-09 08:22:33	guest01348	sorry for my ignorance but what is "CSMT patch" tbh the only way i've used wine is thru playonlinux
2016-02-09 08:23:20	guest01348	technically?
2016-02-09 08:23:25	gnarface	guest01348: its an experimental patch you can only get if you build wine yourself from scratch, it fixes the problem where WoW doesn't use more than about 30% of your total CPU cores total power
2016-02-09 08:23:49	turol	guest01348: technically: it moves some opengl processing to another thread
2016-02-09 08:23:54	turol	which might or might not make it faster
2016-02-09 08:23:55	guest01348	i tried neverwinter online with playonlinux and almost meted my cpu lol
2016-02-09 08:24:02	guest01348	using 100% of it heh
2016-02-09 08:24:22	guest01348	melted*
2016-02-09 08:24:23	disharmonic	gnarface: Actually POL ships wine binaries with CSMT
2016-02-09 08:24:32	gnarface	disharmonic: oh? didn't know that
2016-02-09 08:24:43	gnarface	guest01348: maybe you can get playonlinux to do it; check their info for CSMT
2016-02-09 08:25:12	guest01348	will do
2016-02-09 08:25:52	guest01348	How can I use the CSMT patch with POL?  Up until recently, you would have needed to request a patched WineBuild. Now, with the help of the devs at wine-staging, we have WineBuilds with the patchset from wine-staging, which happen to contain the CSMT patch (for now; when patches from wine-staging get mainlined, they are dropped from the -staging versions of Wine, as they are now a default feature.).  Simply go to Manage Win
2016-02-09 08:25:59	guest01348	pretty much :P
2016-02-09 08:26:52	guest01348	oh and i always thought shadowrun was like some sort of futuristic baldurs gate were you used more than 1 char
2016-02-09 08:27:36	gnarface	guest01348: well, that's actually a good description of it.  the "Boston Lockdown" one has multiplayer too though
2016-02-09 08:27:48	guest01348	i se
2016-02-09 08:27:50	guest01348	see*
2016-02-09 08:28:30	guest01348	i see what you meant when you said "sort of an mmo"
2016-02-09 08:29:20	gnarface	well its first of all turn-based, and second of all it lacks the kind of "massive" feel that games like WoW have; it doesn't really have a giant open world to wander around in.  the multiplayer features feel kinda bolted on
2016-02-09 08:29:53	gnarface	you have a massively multiplayer *chat* but outside of ad-hoc mission groupings there is very little multiplayer interactions

2016-02-09 08:30:22	guest01348	aye
2016-02-09 08:30:31	gnarface	but calling it an MMO in the same context as World of Warcraft seems inaccurate to me
2016-02-09 08:30:36	guest01348	defo added to my list now that you have mentioned it
2016-02-09 08:30:37	guest01348	:D
2016-02-09 08:30:58	guest01348	some mmos are very instance based tbh so it was a close call
2016-02-09 08:31:06	gnarface	yea its very instance based like that
2016-02-09 08:31:06	guest01348	non the less
2016-02-09 08:31:17	gnarface	it reminds me a lot of Phantasy Star Online 1&2
2016-02-09 08:31:23	gnarface	in the way multiplayer is
2016-02-09 08:31:33	gnarface	very instance-centric

2016-02-09 08:32:15	gnarface	they didn't keep it online very long though

2016-02-09 08:32:45	gnarface	one nice thing about "Shadowrun: Boston Lockdown" however compared to wow and phantasy star is there's no monthy charge

2016-02-09 08:43:25	stqn	hm now that I think of it, I have wine staging. But I don’t think I enabled csmt.
2016-02-09 08:43:44	gnarface	stqn: needing the latest i7 to crack 30fps in a crowded area isn't what i consider "well"
2016-02-09 08:44:19	disharmonic	I think i'
2016-02-09 08:44:34	gnarface	stqn: especially since it used to run much better, and performance has degraded significantly with very little apparent visual enhancement every time they release a new expansion

2016-02-09 08:47:50	gnarface	stqn: i really need to get around to trying that CSMT patch.  i'm curious whether you actually have it or not.  i'm *not* using wine-staging at all yet
2016-02-09 08:47:53	stqn	I admit I recently only tried low pop areas
2016-02-09 08:48:07	gnarface	yea it runs great if you're in low-population areas, especially in the old world
2016-02-09 08:48:22	gnarface	or inside a building, or even in most instances/raids
2016-02-09 08:48:39	gnarface	unfortunately those are also the cases where performance matters the least too
2016-02-09 08:50:11	gnarface	and then there's some minor indignities with regards to the advanced graphical features that used to work right in wine, and were disabled for no other reason than that they changed the interfaces to dx11 from dx9
2016-02-09 08:52:27	gnarface	so yea, i wouldn't characterize it as running "well" merely "acceptable"

2016-02-09 08:59:16	gnarface	i'm also curious what percentage of your cpu cores are in use
2016-02-09 08:59:22	gnarface	mine top out at about 30% of each
2016-02-09 08:59:28	gnarface	though its evenly spread across them
2016-02-09 08:59:34	gnarface	i've been told CSMT should fix it
2016-02-09 08:59:56	gnarface	gpu load appears to be "trivial"
2016-02-09 09:01:08	gnarface	and actually the graphical settings affect my framerate floor almost not at all
2016-02-09 09:01:25	gnarface	as in, i can't get better performance putting everything on low
2016-02-09 09:01:37	gnarface	the bottleneck seems to be in the multi-threading

2016-02-09 09:16:57	gnarface	stqn: i gotta assume the framerate difference has to do with just having a much faster cpu

2016-02-09 09:21:39	gnarface	last i checked you need an older wine version to get past that

2016-02-09 09:47:04	gnarface	alright so you got like 15fps on me
2016-02-09 09:47:38	gnarface	probably cause your i7 is actually a lot faster than my ancient phenomII
2016-02-09 09:47:55	stqn	I suppose the i5 helps.

2016-02-09 09:48:02	gnarface	ah
2016-02-09 09:48:10	Half-Shot	It makes that much of a difference? Which Phenom gnarface ?

2016-02-09 09:55:33	gnarface	its bullshit that you can't do it

2016-02-09 09:57:01	gnarface	that probably is what they're afraid of
2016-02-09 09:57:22	gnarface	the problem is that's not a legal justification
2016-02-09 09:57:42	gnarface	so they lie in court and say its because they're afraid users won't be able to tell the difference
2016-02-09 09:57:50	stqn	uh, what?
2016-02-09 09:58:18	stqn	isn’t the server code proprietary and not distributed to anyone?
2016-02-09 09:58:30	gnarface	well sure but it can be reverse engineered from the client
2016-02-09 09:58:32	gnarface	and people have done it
2016-02-09 09:58:35	gnarface	successfully
2016-02-09 09:58:57	stqn	that’s surprising.
2016-02-09 09:59:26	gnarface	but as soon as their projects gain any level of popularity blizzard brings the legal hammer down claiming that new users might get confused and mistake one of these free server projects for the official one
2016-02-09 10:00:13	gnarface	nonetheless, the most popular free wow projects are largely centered around rolling back to the original pre-expansion vanilla ruleset
2016-02-09 10:00:25	gnarface	which i think is a perfectly justifiable use case
2016-02-09 10:01:42	gnarface	blizzard has been attacking 3rd party projects since way back in the warcraft2 days though
2016-02-09 10:01:51	gnarface	this is hardly new behavior for them
2016-02-09 10:02:32	stqn	CSMT does seem to improve things. Higher FPS, one CPU core used to 100%, and 80% GPU usage instead of 68 earlier.
2016-02-09 10:02:58	gnarface	yea, i gotta get around to making a build with it :-/ building wine on debian SUUUUCKS though

2016-02-09 10:33:33	Half-Shot	It shows it's inheritance, but it doesn't 'clone' it imo.
2016-02-09 10:33:56	gnarface	Half-Shot: well it looks like theyr'e trying to add story and character to TF2 a bit  "like if Pixar had made TF2" i hear people say a lot.  it could work... *shrug*
2016-02-09 10:34:03	Half-Shot	I WANT valve to take TF2 to competitive, but they are taking a god damn long while.
2016-02-09 10:34:25	Half-Shot	gnarface, valve have done a really decent job with the story if you look at all the law through the comics
2016-02-09 10:34:32	Half-Shot	It's got a lot of charm
2016-02-09 10:34:48	Half-Shot	Overwatch is your hard boiled competitive shooter
2016-02-09 10:34:50	gnarface	oh? i guess i haven't seen any of the comics
2016-02-09 10:34:59	gnarface	i didn't know there were any

2016-02-09 10:36:40	gnarface	so it says here basically they've been retroactively adding story into what started originally as a cast of generic archetypes... cool
2016-02-09 10:37:09	Half-Shot	Yep. They had a neat idea but it was very shallow. So they added lots of depth behind the scenes
2016-02-09 10:37:21	Half-Shot	I think a bunch of valve people just like comic books
2016-02-09 10:37:32	gnarface	nothing wrong with that
2016-02-09 10:37:34	psymin	I like comic books!  What a coincidence!
2016-02-09 10:37:56	Half-Shot	It's one of the coolest ways to do a video game law, that's for sure.

2016-02-09 10:39:42	stqn	yeah… it’s better with friends.
2016-02-09 10:40:09	stqn	I was wondering if they added fun stuff to do solo
2016-02-09 10:40:15	gnarface	stqn: so, basically starting last fall when there was this explosion of new games on steam that really cut into my WoW time... well, that and a couple key releases on Nintendo
2016-02-09 10:41:05	gnarface	stqn: well there's a TON more content now, if you have all the expansions.  there's a lot more area too, several completely new continents, etc, and a massively overhauled UI that makes stuff alot easier
2016-02-09 10:41:36	gnarface	stqn: i'm not all about questing solo though; i'm in it for the PvP
2016-02-09 10:41:47	stqn	ah ok, makes sense.
2016-02-09 10:41:59	stqn	I don’t like pvp much
2016-02-09 10:42:35	gnarface	i like to experience the raids and end-game content and some of the story and stuff, but i'm not one of those guys who will just play the same raids over and over again every night... i seek the thrill of the hunt.  the adrenaline rush you can only get from fighting sentient beings
2016-02-09 10:43:10	gnarface	raid bosses are just ... too predictable
2016-02-09 10:43:36	gnarface	and questing gets boring to me after a while if i'm just doing it alone
2016-02-09 10:43:44	stqn	yep
2016-02-09 10:43:50	stqn	exactly…
2016-02-09 10:44:09	stqn	I really enjoyed instances but you need a good group

2016-02-09 10:44:44	gnarface	finding 39 other people who aren't retarded is really hard
2016-02-09 10:45:19	stqn	which is why I never did any raid… almost

2016-02-09 10:48:33	gnarface	really my biggest complaint about it is that it seems like the quality of people has dropped. i'm not sure why exactly, but WoW players used to all seem like cool nerds, and now they mostly seem like trolling douchebags
2016-02-09 10:48:43	gnarface	just a bunch of sarcastic griefing assholes
2016-02-09 10:48:55	gnarface	what game are all the cool nerds playing now?
2016-02-09 10:49:01	gnarface	i haven't figured it out
2016-02-09 10:49:17	gnarface	maybe they made wow too easy? or maybe it just got too popular
2016-02-09 10:49:19	gnarface	i dunno
2016-02-09 10:49:57	gnarface	on a good day you can still, if you're lucky, get 25 or so cooperative intellectuals together by chance and win in Ashran though

2016-02-09 10:52:36	gnarface	maybe just early on when i knew personally people who actually played and i was in a guild with them, mabye they shielded me from the drama caused by the griefers and the farmers and the idiots
2016-02-09 10:53:01	gnarface	once they all got bored of it and moved on to games you can't play in wine, i was left stranded
2016-02-09 10:55:58	gnarface	i'll bend alot of principle just for escapism and an occasional sense of camaraderie ... but i won't go so far as to install windows.  f that
2016-02-09 10:57:51	gnarface	if i could run my own WoW server i could just ban everyone who pissed me off :-p

2016-02-09 11:31:34	No1RL355	stqn, its external drive
2016-02-09 11:31:56	No1RL355	Im used it to backup my things
2016-02-09 11:32:11	gnarface	No1RL355: hashes of files with empty space might change if you move them to different filesystem types i think, due to differnences of sparse/non-sparse handling of concurrent sectors of zeros
2016-02-09 11:32:13	No1RL355	but looks like it changes files time-by time

2016-02-09 11:33:51	gnarface	No1RL355: even like if there's a linux boot disk ISO in there somewhere, even after you've tar&gzipped the whole thing, could throw the checksum off

2016-02-09 11:34:37	No1RL355	moved it on disk and forgot about it

2016-02-09 11:35:54	gnarface	well, the bad seagate drives should be isolated to some specific model numbers.  you can look that up

2016-02-09 12:21:53	dagget10	windows 10 repair killed grub XD
2016-02-09 12:22:57	gnarface	people have been telling me i need windows since i stopped using it like 17 years ago....
2016-02-09 12:23:13	gnarface	so far i haven't seen any proof
2016-02-09 12:23:15	qptain_Nemo	gnarface: why did you say installing grub would lock one out of w10?
2016-02-09 12:23:32	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: wishful thinking?
2016-02-09 12:23:34	dagget10	windows is only better than linux in the fact you dont have to deal with wine
2016-02-09 12:23:46	qptain_Nemo	dagget10: i'd disagree even there
2016-02-09 12:23:50	dagget10	windows died at windows 8 though, so no big deal about wine
2016-02-09 12:24:01	qptain_Nemo	wine gives you a degree of freedom with using windows applications that you don't have on windows

2016-02-09 12:25:20	GolBot	[ WineHQ - Trove Release ]
2016-02-09 12:25:57	dagget10	i have never heard of anyone getting trove running properly on linux
2016-02-09 12:26:29	gnarface	dagget10: according to this, someone did, around september of last year
2016-02-09 12:26:42	dagget10	ill have to see if it works
2016-02-09 12:26:51	gnarface	doesn't look easy, definitely looks possible
2016-02-09 12:28:20	dagget10	i think ill stick to windows 10...
2016-02-09 12:28:40	dagget10	besides, i highly doubt i can run naninights on linux
2016-02-09 12:28:56	gnarface	you're free to do what you like, i was merely objecting to your definition of "need"
2016-02-09 12:29:25	gnarface	as long as you tell yourself its a "need" you're ceding responsibility for your actions
2016-02-09 12:29:50	gnarface	when you admit its a desire, a want, and one based primarily on laziness, only then you can stop being a victim
2016-02-09 12:30:11	gnarface	only then can you use your computer, instead of being used BY your computer
2016-02-09 12:32:29	gnarface	even if you don't want to deal with wine, you could always be running windows in a VM inside your linux install, rather than the other way around
2016-02-09 12:32:59	gnarface	kvm runs windows on linux so well now even microsoft chooses to do it that way for their azure platform
2016-02-09 12:32:59	dagget10	its not that simple
2016-02-09 12:33:35	dagget10	im actually running windows 10, and using a guest vm of windows 10
2016-02-09 12:33:47	dagget10	on the guest vm, im going to make a guest vm of linux
2016-02-09 12:34:11	dagget10	also if i randomly leave, my host system hit a bluescreen
2016-02-09 12:34:28	gnarface	hilarious, but i still don't see how that's any easier than doing it the other way around, with linux as the host.  in fact it sounds a lot like you're making it harder on yourself than necessary
2016-02-09 12:34:51	gnarface	which is truly sadly ironic, if you're doing this to make it easier on yourself
2016-02-09 12:35:03	gnarface	but you'd hardly be the first windows user in such a position
2016-02-09 12:35:20	gnarface	their brainwashing is very good
2016-02-09 12:35:34	dagget10	ok plan b
2016-02-09 12:35:42	dagget10	whats an easy to install bootloader
2016-02-09 12:36:13	gnarface	that's the wrong question
2016-02-09 12:36:27	dagget10	why?
2016-02-09 12:36:44	gnarface	there are really only two, lilo and grub.  and you don't choose either based on ease-of-install
2016-02-09 12:37:38	dagget10	well, how can i install grub without destroying windows 10?
2016-02-09 12:38:06	gnarface	the easiest way you mean? remove the windows10 drive first.  put linux on a different drive
2016-02-09 12:38:22	dagget10	alright ill try another way
2016-02-09 12:38:23	gnarface	use your bios to select which one to boot from
2016-02-09 12:38:39	gnarface	you know what a livecd is right?
2016-02-09 12:38:42	dagget10	ill format the 2nd partition and put ubuntu there
2016-02-09 12:38:45	dagget10	no clue :D
2016-02-09 12:38:50	gnarface	oh
2016-02-09 12:38:52	gnarface	well shoot
2016-02-09 12:38:56	gnarface	hang on for all that
2016-02-09 12:39:03	gnarface	you need to know what a livecd is
2016-02-09 12:39:12	dagget10	here i have an idea
2016-02-09 12:39:13	gnarface	do you have a spare USB key with nothing you care about on it?
2016-02-09 12:39:27	dagget10	how can i put mint ON a usb key
2016-02-09 12:39:37	gnarface	THAT is the right question
2016-02-09 12:39:52	dagget10	not to install on a computer, as an actual system
2016-02-09 12:39:58	gnarface	yep
2016-02-09 12:40:19	gnarface	the answer is "the same way you'd put it on any normal harddrive"
2016-02-09 12:40:21	gnarface	but
2016-02-09 12:40:35	gnarface	you should try a "live" image first
2016-02-09 12:40:44	dagget10	whats live image
2016-02-09 12:41:04	gnarface	grok this: https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
2016-02-09 12:41:04	GolBot	[ Debian -- Live install images ]
2016-02-09 12:41:39	gnarface	its like a pocket pre-made linux install you can carry on USB basically.
2016-02-09 12:41:47	gnarface	no installation necessary
2016-02-09 12:41:50	gnarface	it just boots
2016-02-09 12:41:55	dagget10	so i need a live version of mint
2016-02-09 12:42:15	stqn	I use syslinux
2016-02-09 12:42:18	gnarface	not NEED.  WANT.  you *could* just do a regular install of mint on a USB key too.  unlike windows, linux doesn't care
2016-02-09 12:42:29	gnarface	but the live versions make it alot easier
2016-02-09 12:42:31	stqn	grub and lilo are dead ;)
2016-02-09 12:42:32	qptain_Nemo	aren't all mint distributions livecd/usbs by default?
2016-02-09 12:42:33	gnarface	and more portable
2016-02-09 12:42:49	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: honestly i don't know that much about mint
2016-02-09 12:43:02	qptain_Nemo	i think they are
2016-02-09 12:43:34	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: they might be hybrid-iso by default now because debian is, but that's not necessarily the same as it being "live"
2016-02-09 12:43:51	qptain_Nemo	i'm pretty sure they are

2016-02-09 12:47:17	dagget10	alright, so how do i install it on
2016-02-09 12:47:33	gnarface	dd
2016-02-09 12:47:43	gnarface	dagget10: on linux, you'd just put it on a USB key with dd
2016-02-09 12:47:54	dagget10	dd?
2016-02-09 12:48:10	gnarface	dagget10: yep.  dd, a very old native program in linux.  from windows, you need a 3rd party program called rawrite i think

2016-02-09 12:49:59	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: are you?

2016-02-09 12:56:00	dagget10	took 30 seconds
2016-02-09 12:56:03	gnarface	oh
2016-02-09 12:56:07	gnarface	that uh... sounds way too fast
2016-02-09 12:56:11	gnarface	what did you try?

2016-02-09 12:56:35	gnarface	you did that from windows?
2016-02-09 12:56:42	dagget10	yea
2016-02-09 12:56:48	gnarface	windows has dd now??
2016-02-09 12:56:55	dagget10	cygwin
2016-02-09 12:57:07	gnarface	fascinating
2016-02-09 12:57:21	gnarface	well you're already in over my head.  like i said, i haven't used windows in almost 20 years
2016-02-09 12:57:39	dagget10	should i try it?
2016-02-09 12:57:40	gnarface	it should take a lot longer than 30 seconds to DD a 1GB iso to a usb key though
2016-02-09 12:58:22	dagget10	if i open the usb key should i see any files?
2016-02-09 12:58:41	gnarface	dagget10: on linux you would.  i don't know crap about windows, and even less about cygwin
2016-02-09 12:59:36	gnarface	dagget10: i expect due to the short copy time that it won't work though
2016-02-09 13:00:39	gnarface	dagget10: frankly, i can't advocate you do anything at all until you're sure.  i won't be responsible for you accidentally hosing your windows install

2016-02-09 13:01:02	dagget10	3.5 seconds
2016-02-09 13:01:14	dagget10	and the key is empty
2016-02-09 13:01:18	gnarface	dagget10: in a fair world, it should be a simple matter of calling a dd command like that, but in linux the paths would look all different, and due to the physical limitations of usb keys, it should take ... the better part of an hour really
2016-02-09 13:01:33	gnarface	at least
2016-02-09 13:02:03	gnarface	i'm sure someone has done this successfully from windows, but i have not
2016-02-09 13:02:20	dagget10	they have, i looked it up earlier
2016-02-09 13:02:28	dagget10	i need 2 usb keys and i only have 1
2016-02-09 13:03:04	gnarface	you said you had linux running in a VM?  maybe try it from inside the linux VM
2016-02-09 13:03:28	dagget10	i could try, but ill have to download an ubuntu iso
2016-02-09 13:03:45	dagget10	vmware wont load mint
2016-02-09 13:03:47	gnarface	dagget10: how big is the "linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-64bit.iso" file?
2016-02-09 13:04:10	dagget10	1.47gb
2016-02-09 13:04:17	gnarface	sounds right
2016-02-09 13:04:23	gnarface	ballpark at least
2016-02-09 13:05:44	gnarface	but its not *physically possible* for it to copy all that to a USB flash key in less than about 20 minutes
2016-02-09 13:05:59	gnarface	for most cheap USB flash keys it would probably take twice that amount of time
2016-02-09 13:06:50	gnarface	all i can tell you for sure is i think you're on the right path now
2016-02-09 13:06:58	gnarface	just ... be careful where you point dd
2016-02-09 13:07:04	gnarface	you can cause a lot of damage with it
2016-02-09 13:09:00	dagget10	im using something called linux live usb creator
2016-02-09 13:09:08	dagget10	live or persistent
2016-02-09 13:09:14	dagget10	and what is persistent linux
2016-02-09 13:09:45	gnarface	oh so, a normal live usb won't save your stuff after reboot.  it resets to stock after every reboot.  you probably want persistent
2016-02-09 13:10:27	gnarface	a persistent live image will behave more like a normal install; but be warned, it will cause additional wear on your USB key
2016-02-09 13:11:03	gnarface	(as in, do NOT do this if your USB key has some sort of sentimental value, or if you cannot afford to replace it)
2016-02-09 13:12:39	dagget10	well it was a $10 key from walmart, its only value is 32 gb
2016-02-09 13:13:34	gnarface	there's no guarantee it will die quickly either
2016-02-09 13:13:55	gnarface	its hit&miss
2016-02-09 13:14:56	gnarface	they can last a very long time being used like this too, but occasionally you find one with a flaw, and doing persistence will tend to expose those flaws much quicker
2016-02-09 13:15:29	dagget10	should i just use live and then use onedrive?
2016-02-09 13:15:51	gnarface	up to you really
2016-02-09 13:16:22	gnarface	that would probably significantly reduce wear though, yes
2016-02-09 13:16:30	gnarface	since it would be read-only
2016-02-09 13:16:39	gnarface	its the writes that cause the extra wear
2016-02-09 13:17:19	gnarface	due to the way linux filesystems are (journaling by default) writes cause a lot more wear to flash than with fat32, which is NOT journalin g
2016-02-09 13:17:23	gnarface	*journaling

2016-02-09 14:39:10	drumr	um yeah
2016-02-09 14:39:12	drumr	of course
2016-02-09 14:39:18	Mneuro	?
2016-02-09 14:39:50	Mneuro	g3258 performs about 50% as well on linux as windows, but i'm noticing the i5-4590 is basically exactly the same on windows and linux
2016-02-09 14:40:03	Mneuro	i'm guessing since it's a cpu there is no reason to have performance loss, but the g3258 seems to be bad
2016-02-09 14:40:28	drumr	yeah its worse than a celeron
2016-02-09 14:40:41	Mneuro	Either way, I am so glad to be able to play my games acceptably on linux now
2016-02-09 14:40:57	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:41:03	Mneuro	Tried alien.  On the g3258 i got like 30fps on medium settings and with the i5 i get 60fps on ultra
2016-02-09 14:41:07	drumr	what did you have before
2016-02-09 14:41:29	drumr	yeah the g3258 is not a gaming cpu
2016-02-09 14:41:30	Mneuro	I had a G3258 CPU and GTX 960 GPU
2016-02-09 14:41:34	Mneuro	yea it is
2016-02-09 14:41:49	Mneuro	it's a special dual core that can be overclocked a lot
2016-02-09 14:41:56	Mneuro	it actually outperforms most/all i3's

2016-02-09 14:44:23	Mneuro	it is right neck and neck with an i3-4130 at stock
2016-02-09 14:44:28	Mneuro	and can be overclocked to 4.5ghz
2016-02-09 14:44:48	Mneuro	it doesn't really matter because on linux it is absolute rubbish
2016-02-09 14:45:10	Mneuro	The i5-4590 is amazing
2016-02-09 14:45:24	drumr	i would never use an i3 for gaming
2016-02-09 14:45:29	drumr	ever
2016-02-09 14:45:51	Mneuro	me either, the g3258 was just a stopgap solution to hold me over until i could get an i5.  it was only $50 so no real loss
2016-02-09 14:46:02	drumr	ah
2016-02-09 14:46:08	Mneuro	i3's aren't really worth the price
2016-02-09 14:46:10	drumr	that would be different since boards support so many
2016-02-09 14:46:18	Mneuro	i can also play grid now on ultra <3

2016-02-09 14:48:46	Mneuro	in windows they are alright.  I'm not sure what is the difference really
2016-02-09 14:48:58	Mneuro	in windows i can play alien on 60fps locked with the g3258 on ultra
2016-02-09 14:49:14	Mneuro	maybe just that linux ports seem to be more cpu dependent
2016-02-09 14:49:28	drumr	could be
2016-02-09 14:49:44	drumr	if it was multiplayer it would probably be more dependent on the gpu too
2016-02-09 14:50:14	drumr	yeah gxxxx series is the new celeron

2016-02-09 14:50:33	drumr	i used to view as i3 as those until
2016-02-09 14:50:35	Mneuro	you get a pretty decent bang for your buck with them for sure
2016-02-09 14:50:40	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:50:42	Mneuro	I've never understood i3's
2016-02-09 14:50:47	Mneuro	they just make no sense for their price
2016-02-09 14:50:48	drumr	i would use them in a mini comp or something
2016-02-09 14:50:53	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:51:20	Mneuro	if you are going to pay over 100 USD for a CPU, you might as well get a decent i5 for 150-180

2016-02-15 00:26:11	openfbtd	Also if linux systems become as popular, they will become so because they will cater to the lowest common denominator, so shit
2016-02-15 00:26:46	openfbtd	I see myself using something else in 10 years sitting there sad about not having any games >_>
2016-02-15 00:27:04	openfbtd	Because linux distros became unuseable
2016-02-15 00:27:06	homerj	MS is already on the way out in general
2016-02-15 00:27:18	homerj	but I don't know how much they can hold on
2016-02-15 00:27:52	homerj	Microsoft's real bread & butter has been small and medium range business
2016-02-15 00:28:04	homerj	Exchange license, Active Directory, etc.
2016-02-15 00:28:16	homerj	but that's getting phased out via various cloud offerings
2016-02-15 00:29:00	homerj	10 years ago, if I had a 100 person company and wanted email, that was Exchange
2016-02-15 00:29:17	homerj	today? that's either Google, or 100 other people doing it, and I don't have to manage it
2016-02-15 00:29:41	baizon	i hate that cloud stuff :/
2016-02-15 00:29:46	openfbtd	We have a 100 person IT company and we use a local Exchange because security
2016-02-15 00:29:58	openfbtd	No trust in other companies to not sell our info
2016-02-15 00:30:26	homerj	when you actually use Google for that, they aren't sending you ads
2016-02-15 00:30:47	homerj	when you get into the paid tiers
2016-02-15 00:31:22	openfbtd	It's still pretty idiotic to host corporate email with Google
2016-02-15 00:31:48	baizon	we use office 365 :(
2016-02-15 00:31:59	baizon	thank god i dont have to write, so i can use ubuntu
2016-02-15 00:33:17	homerj	openfbtd, why?
2016-02-15 00:33:34	homerj	Google is about as secure as you can be
2016-02-15 00:33:56	homerj	more so than the VAST majority of Exchange installs

2016-02-15 00:35:46	homerj	openfbtd, what kind of polish do you use for your tin foil hat?
2016-02-15 00:37:38	homerj	but if you REALLY want local, there's things like Zimbra(now owned by vmware)

2016-02-15 00:38:48	homerj	it's generally about $500/year to put Microsoft email on a company desktop
2016-02-15 00:39:26	linux_gamer	GermainZ, WHAT GPU?
2016-02-15 00:39:49	homerj	Exchange/Service licensing, CALs, Office licenses, etc.
2016-02-15 00:40:07	homerj	not to mention another Server install for AD
2016-02-15 00:40:45	linux_gamer	laptop: when its good weather outside you cant see shit or its too cold or you laptop drowns
2016-02-15 00:41:11	homerj	you start adding things like Service Center into the mix, putting an average computer in front of someone can be over a grand a year in MS licenses alone
2016-02-15 00:41:47	homerj	that's how MS makes their cash
2016-02-15 00:42:05	homerj	all this other stuff, mobile, xbox, etc. loses money
2016-02-15 00:43:16	homerj	all the other stuff is where people are going, but they don't want the MS stuff
2016-02-15 00:43:29	homerj	despite MS spending billions trying to be people to use it

2016-02-15 22:37:45	Ysblokje	build a game like a  painting lib ?
2016-02-15 22:38:59	Smilex	oh it's not a library necessarily. It's a editor. But it's difficult and no one seems interested, so I question if I'm going mad. Also I decided to take a break this week sort of, and created a game

2016-02-15 23:00:57	linux_gamer	Samsai, you think 99% of syrians is against the president?
2016-02-15 23:01:13	linux_gamer	and only the soldiers fight for him?
2016-02-15 23:01:28	@Samsai	i mean, if you are fighting for him then yeah
2016-02-15 23:01:40	@Samsai	kinda makes you part of the syrian military, right?
2016-02-15 23:01:45	linux_gamer	im not syrian
2016-02-15 23:02:01	Ysblokje	Samsai, they shoot ppl who wont join the army
2016-02-15 23:02:07	linux_gamer	i can confess, unlike 60-80% of "syrian" "rebels"
2016-02-15 23:02:45	Ysblokje	no matter which side, you're fucked
2016-02-15 23:03:52	linux_gamer	thats right
2016-02-15 23:05:02	@Samsai	being on the russian's side significantly reduces your chances of getting hit by an air strike
2016-02-15 23:05:09	@Samsai	provided you are not within syria
2016-02-15 23:06:18	linux_gamer	russian blames us for some some of the bombing in aleppo
2016-02-15 23:06:36	@Samsai	sounds familiar
2016-02-15 23:06:47	@Samsai	are you sure it wasn't an artillery strike?
2016-02-15 23:06:56	linux_gamer	to keep in mind russia is active <6 months -> IS has lost massive area
2016-02-15 23:07:10	Smilex	Ysblokje: I didn't mention it, but maybe you figured it out. To compile you run the build.sh in the build directory
2016-02-15 23:07:23	linux_gamer	coalition forces (2 year) -> IS spread like cancer
2016-02-15 23:07:53	Ysblokje	Smilex,  I am trying to resist writing a CMakeLists.txt file \;)
2016-02-15 23:07:54	linux_gamer	Smilex, ./configure; make; make install
2016-02-15 23:08:11	@Samsai	i imagine IS would be a lot smaller threat if russia directed more of their weaponry at them
2016-02-15 23:08:30	linux_gamer	bs, look at the borders left to right
2016-02-15 23:08:44	linux_gamer	government, "rebel", IS
2016-02-15 23:08:53	@Samsai	currently only about 10% of their capability targets IS targets
2016-02-15 23:08:57	linux_gamer	how to attack IS, makes not much sense
2016-02-15 23:09:03	@Samsai	rest of it is kinda all over the place
2016-02-15 23:09:13	linux_gamer	10% is way better than 0%
2016-02-15 23:09:18	@Samsai	sure
2016-02-15 23:09:35	linux_gamer	remember US needed month to save kobane?

2016-02-15 23:11:30	frankyboy_	who needs prove? it is a fact that civilians are suffering from airstrikes
2016-02-15 23:12:45	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, US: russia attacked a hospital a (obscure) source said! RU: "give us the name and location" US: We can't its secret. RU: OK, got it
2016-02-15 23:12:55	frankyboy_	thing is there are sooo many russian air strikes every day... i start wondering if situation is too bad out there
2016-02-15 23:13:36	linux_gamer	there are russian but where the fuck are any coalition strikes?
2016-02-15 23:14:05	linux_gamer	IS can showcase their equipment freely in deir-Ezzor
2016-02-15 23:14:06	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, are there reports of stries?
2016-02-15 23:14:13	frankyboy_	strikes*
2016-02-15 23:14:29	@Samsai	well, the coalition has also struck a hospital with an air strike
2016-02-15 23:14:35	@Samsai	that stuff got spread around quite nicely
2016-02-15 23:15:04	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, just imagine US needed 10 weeks to free Kobane, a fcking village
2016-02-15 23:15:10	linux_gamer	Samsai, thats riht
2016-02-15 23:15:49	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, yup, but syrian army is fighting long time too against rebels or "rebels"
2016-02-15 23:16:19	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, they didnt secure the borders any country with openborders is fcked up
2016-02-15 23:16:43	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i don't think it is that easy to secure borders
2016-02-15 23:17:04	linux_gamer	you see the map and you can clearly see the IS(back then) and rebel now supply route to turkey
2016-02-15 23:17:12	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats the problem
2016-02-15 23:17:44	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, Merkel said its impssible to secure the border to Germany
2016-02-15 23:17:58	frankyboy_	problem is that coalition isn't working together
2016-02-15 23:18:43	linux_gamer	bs, theres like 7cm of border per inhabitant in germany
2016-02-15 23:18:52	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i've seen videos how refugees get to eu with interviews how much they pay to travel to eu.
2016-02-15 23:19:09	linux_gamer	greek border is hard to secure
2016-02-15 23:19:18	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, you ought to read documents about refugees.
2016-02-15 23:19:31	frankyboy_	and how this status is occured and what it grants
2016-02-15 23:19:57	linux_gamer	i myself could build a wall like at least 100m high for my personal 7cm of german borders
2016-02-15 23:20:27	linux_gamer	problem is one just has to take a step left or right
2016-02-15 23:20:58	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, eu and border?
2016-02-15 23:21:08	@Samsai	well, obviously the solution to this problem is to build walls around ourselves and just shield ourselves from that scary scary world outside
2016-02-15 23:21:11	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats a joke i know
2016-02-15 23:21:24	@Samsai	because addressing the symptom and not the cause has always worked
2016-02-15 23:21:26	linux_gamer	Samsai, look at the isreali
2016-02-15 23:21:44	@Samsai	i have, looks kinda terrible
2016-02-15 23:22:01	linux_gamer	suicide bombings every now and then -> wall -> no explosive attacks for years
2016-02-15 23:22:05	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i don't quite understand... are you against people saving their lives from wall?
2016-02-15 23:22:26	linux_gamer	no, wall saves lives
2016-02-15 23:22:27	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, suiciders are using another tacics now
2016-02-15 23:22:44	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats sadly true
2016-02-15 23:22:48	frankyboy_	life in Israel isn't that easy even nowdays.
2016-02-15 23:23:06	frankyboy_	so i don't think your example with Israel suits well
2016-02-15 23:23:15	@Samsai	it's easy to build a wall and then simply ignore anything that goes on behind it
2016-02-15 23:23:18	frankyboy_	imho, tho
2016-02-15 23:23:23	linux_gamer	at least the people have the feeling the gov wants to support them
2016-02-15 23:23:40	linux_gamer	Samsai, are you against firewalls
2016-02-15 23:24:01	@Samsai	i am against blinding myself from the world
2016-02-15 23:24:14	linux_gamer	we could tear down all firewalls and pay the virus-programmers for a better live
2016-02-15 23:24:22	linux_gamer	so that they stop attacking us
2016-02-15 23:24:33	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, how many real refugees and how many fake refugees in germany? what's your opinon?
2016-02-15 23:24:54	linux_gamer	good idea? that would even work for win users ;-) ;-P
2016-02-15 23:25:20	@Samsai	so you think everyone behind the wall is evil and out to kill you?
2016-02-15 23:25:37	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, there cant be refugees because nobody is beeing persecuted in austria
2016-02-15 23:25:47	@Samsai	great, you even have the right attitude
2016-02-15 23:25:53	linux_gamer	Samsai, depends on the wall
2016-02-15 23:25:54	@Samsai	now all that you need is the wall
2016-02-15 23:26:35	linux_gamer	Samsai, wont happen
2016-02-15 23:27:20	linux_gamer	bs to build a wall between germany and austria
2016-02-15 23:27:38	linux_gamer	that would have been 90 years too lake
2016-02-15 23:27:43	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, so refugees can't travel across eu?
2016-02-15 23:28:12	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, many eruropean countries are starting to secure their border
2016-02-15 23:28:20	linux_gamer	european

2016-02-15 23:35:19	linux_gamer	ok one shouldnt as its from cnn (sry for bbc)
2016-02-15 23:35:27	frankyboy_	Samsai, what to trust?
2016-02-15 23:35:45	linux_gamer	you shouldn't trust any "news"
2016-02-15 23:35:52	@Samsai	frankyboy_, not a single source and definitely not a russian source
2016-02-15 23:36:12	frankyboy_	Samsai, well, lol... why definitely?
2016-02-15 23:36:45	frankyboy_	not that i am offended cause i am russian, but curious why definitely?
2016-02-15 23:36:47	@Samsai	because all russian sources are government-owned and they spread bullshit

2016-02-15 23:38:01	Smilex	or at least was
2016-02-15 23:38:09	@Samsai	frankyboy_, the problem is more that the russian sources are owned by the russian government
2016-02-15 23:38:28	frankyboy_	also, how do you know that rt is spreading bullshit? what confirm this?
2016-02-15 23:38:45	@Samsai	i've checked their articles every now and then
2016-02-15 23:38:56	@Samsai	there's an obvious bias against western countries
2016-02-15 23:39:21	frankyboy_	ok, so no obvious bias from western countries againt russia?
2016-02-15 23:39:29	@Samsai	the one good thing that can be said about them is that they aren't as openly anti-finland as other sources
2016-02-15 23:39:35	linux_gamer	Samsai, us are owned by us, finish are ...
2016-02-15 23:40:07	@Samsai	frankyboy_, when it comes to US sources, there's definitely a huge bias against russia
2016-02-15 23:40:18	frankyboy_	Samsai, so same bullshit?
2016-02-15 23:40:25	@Samsai	with US sources, definitely
2016-02-15 23:40:43	frankyboy_	and why definitely only to russian sourses? ^^ that is of what i am curios
2016-02-15 23:40:46	Smilex	The US had the right idea. Privatize media, but keep the sound waves public property, and only distribute frequencies to those that air non-profit news at 7pm
2016-02-15 23:41:18	@Samsai	frankyboy_, because i consider russian sources to be even more untrustworthy than the US media
2016-02-15 23:41:45	frankyboy_	 i see... that is personal point, right?
2016-02-15 23:41:53	frankyboy_	point of view*
2016-02-15 23:42:15	@Samsai	let's just say it's a point of view from someone living right next to russia

2016-02-16 05:28:39	aspidites	ping tumocs
2016-02-16 05:28:56	aspidites	I bought the game a month ago and have yet to be able to play it on my desktop
2016-02-16 05:29:10	tumocs	waddap?
2016-02-16 05:29:13	tumocs	it works
2016-02-16 05:29:15	tumocs	fine
2016-02-16 05:29:32	aspidites	no usable logs, can't inspect it with gdb, filing a ticket was useless ("did you lower graphics settings? Please provide an error log")
2016-02-16 05:29:40	aspidites	are you using an nvidia graphics card, tumocs ?
2016-02-16 05:29:44	tumocs	nope
2016-02-16 05:29:49	tumocs	amd with mesa
2016-02-16 05:29:55	tumocs	my friend run it with nvidia
2016-02-16 05:29:57	tumocs	and arch
2016-02-16 05:30:21	tumocs	in the beginning I had to move the game_x64 to launcher folder for it to work
2016-02-16 05:30:29	tumocs	don't know if you still have to do it
2016-02-16 05:30:34	aspidites	huh, let me try that
2016-02-16 05:30:55	tumocs	if it doesn't, clean the shit up, uninstall and reinstall and do that before updating
2016-02-16 05:31:22	tumocs	yup, I still can log in
2016-02-16 05:31:39	aspidites	is it enough to delete everything from the albiononline directory, or are there transient files elsewhere?
2016-02-16 05:31:55	tumocs	I wouldn't remember
2016-02-16 05:32:16	aspidites	ah ok, thanks anyway
2016-02-16 05:32:31	aspidites	so i'm redownloading the installer after nuking the old directory (and running the installer script)
2016-02-16 05:32:43	aspidites	after that i'll just move game_x64 to launcher and cross my fingers

2016-02-16 05:34:23	aspidites	i'm wondering if there's some library i'm missnig -- I remember reading about audio issues some where
2016-02-16 05:34:34	aspidites	me too -- -Syu'd 10 minutes ago
2016-02-16 05:34:39	tumocs	with the launcher script it should preload necessary libraries
2016-02-16 05:35:21	mirv_	Samsai, article inactive?
2016-02-16 05:35:51	aspidites	nope. Completely black
2016-02-16 05:35:56	aspidites	tumocs: what DE/WM are you using>?
2016-02-16 05:36:09	tumocs	I've run it with xfce and plasma5

2016-02-16 05:36:35	tumocs	check the ldd and the prepackaged libraries and see if you miss something
2016-02-16 05:36:55	aspidites	did that already, but i'll do it again

2016-02-16 05:47:39	aspidites	if only i3 would allow a universal title bar
2016-02-16 05:47:45	aspidites	so much wasted screen real estate

2016-02-16 05:49:10	aspidites	thanks for the info Spl-it
2016-02-16 05:49:12	Spl-it	title bars ? I disabled those

2016-02-16 05:50:23	aspidites	and i didn't want them to be super loud as that was distracting
2016-02-16 05:50:37	aspidites	so border change + single title where my dmenu pops up was a nice compromise

2016-02-16 07:02:26	DrMcCoy	I do have certain legal arguments I can use, like the interoperatibility clauses
2016-02-16 07:02:37	DrMcCoy	But these are defenses
2016-02-16 07:02:53	gnarface	should be protected by "clean-room reverse-engineering" clause, no?
2016-02-16 07:02:55	DrMcCoy	They don't safe me from being hit by a legal threat in the first place

2016-02-16 07:04:19	DrMcCoy	So by going a straight "No piracy" route, and orienting myself at existing project like ScummVM, GemRB and OpenMW, I'm hoping that it doesn't come this far
2016-02-16 07:06:41	DrMcCoy	Will that be enough? I can never be 100% sure
2016-02-16 07:07:09	DrMcCoy	That's the same, of course, for ScummVM, GemRB and OpenMW
2016-02-16 07:11:16	@Samsai	it's weird that a company even has a case if they sue a reverse-engineered project that only ships a binary and nothing else
2016-02-16 07:12:07	@Samsai	but laws and judges are weird
2016-02-16 07:13:06	gnarface	well its not really that they have a case its more that they have a right to sue even without a case
2016-02-16 07:13:20	DrMcCoy	Yes
2016-02-16 07:13:43	DrMcCoy	And a lawsuit takes times, money and nerves
2016-02-16 07:13:55	gnarface	which is frankly bullshit, but not as bullshit as the fact that you would have to *counter-sue* to recoup damages for accrued legal fees defending yourself, even if the case is thrown out with prejudice
2016-02-16 07:14:05	@Samsai	gnarface, knowing how the current system operates in many places there would be a case
2016-02-16 07:14:13	DrMcCoy	gnarface: Well, that depends on the jurisdiction
2016-02-16 07:14:29	@Samsai	and i am afraid a project like xoreos or openmw would end up losing if a company really decides to run them over
2016-02-16 07:14:36	gnarface	i think if you lose the lawsuit *and you were the plaintiff* you should *automatically* also have to cover the defense's legal costs
2016-02-16 07:16:36	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdictions do that
2016-02-16 07:16:39	gnarface	hopefully it would be simple though in the case of xoreos to just show the code and prove it was all based on purely reverse-engineered knowledge, none of it literally stolen from their office development code repos, and then get the case succinctly thrown out
2016-02-16 07:16:58	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdiction let the court decide how both sides' costs are split
2016-02-16 07:17:23	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdictions let the court just mandate a flat fee (which often doesn't cover basically anything)
2016-02-16 07:19:06	DrMcCoy	The problem, still, is of course that you need to have a whole wad of cash upfront first
2016-02-16 07:24:29	DrMcCoy	If I were sued, I'd first contact the Software Freedom Conservancy and the Software Feedom Law Center. That's not quite their speciality (they do GPL enforcement), but they might have some pointers
2016-02-16 07:24:47	gnarface	yea, that sucks, and at least here in the US, alot of big companies aim law suits at smaller competitors knowing that it will bankrupt them regardless of the outcome of the case
2016-02-16 07:25:23	DrMcCoy	As for a lawyer here in Germany, my sister's BF has lawyer in the family (none of the specializing on copyright law, though), and my father's cousin works in court. So I might have referals there
2016-02-16 07:25:29	gnarface	the EFF has been known to champion such causes though
2016-02-16 07:25:40	gnarface	(Electronic Frontier Foundation)
2016-02-16 07:25:52	gnarface	they've provided legal backing for smaller projects that couldn't afford their own defense
2016-02-16 07:25:53	DrMcCoy	Right, yes :)
2016-02-16 07:26:45	gnarface	i would, in such a position send the first email to the EFF and the second one to Slashdot

2016-02-16 07:27:12	DrMcCoy	There's also the question where someone will sue me. Whether it'll be in Germany or in the US. For the latter case, I'm not sure I'd be extradicted for a civil suit
2016-02-16 07:27:30	gnarface	yea i don't think they could do shit to you from here
2016-02-16 07:28:19	DrMcCoy	And in Germany, courts are in general more sane
2016-02-16 07:28:20	gnarface	but i guess where they even *can* sue you depends on where they even hold copyrights
2016-02-16 07:28:47	gnarface	if the specific content isn't copyrighted in germany that makes you a lot safer
2016-02-16 07:29:13	DrMcCoy	The Berne Convention pretty much makes it an international thing

2016-02-16 07:30:19	lemony123	what have I missed?
2016-02-16 07:30:27	DrMcCoy	For a big corporation, it's no problem getting them registered "everywhere"
2016-02-16 07:30:58	gnarface	but retroactively? isn't a lot of this content a couple decades old in the first place?
2016-02-16 07:31:18	gnarface	would it still count for older games if they weren't registered "everywhere" back then?
2016-02-16 07:31:40	DrMcCoy	Well, "BioWare" is probably registed everywhere
2016-02-16 07:31:44	DrMcCoy	As is "Star Wars"
2016-02-16 07:32:06	gnarface	ah, yea
2016-02-16 07:32:08	gnarface	hmm
2016-02-16 07:32:12	DrMcCoy	Neverwinter Nights probably too, since there's also WotC/Hasbro in it
2016-02-16 07:32:42	homerj	you see, the flaw with these kinds of projects, people just need to do them and release it when it's complete

2016-02-16 07:55:16	DrMcCoy	Fenix2412: C++
2016-02-16 07:55:40	DrMcCoy	C++03, to be precise
2016-02-16 07:55:51	Gallomimia	03??
2016-02-16 07:55:53	Fenix2412	k
2016-02-16 07:55:58	DrMcCoy	For compatibility reasons, I'm eschewing C++11
2016-02-16 07:56:11	gnarface	DrMcCoy: i still plan on joining your project but i have some emotional issues to overcome first (primarily a fundamental mistrust of github) and i'd in all honestly be learning a lot more from what you wrote than actually contributing anything of value, i'd be dead weight probably
2016-02-16 07:56:51	gnarface	still, it sounds like a good way to grow skills
2016-02-16 07:56:52	DrMcCoy	gnarface: You are free to use xoreos as a learning thing any time, of course
2016-02-16 07:57:25	DrMcCoy	And yes, I'm not all too keen on GitHub either, especially since GitHub itself is proprietary code
2016-02-16 07:57:34	gnarface	maybe i could help migrate some of the opengl 1.x code to opengl 3.x :-p
2016-02-16 07:57:47	gnarface	then it would only be like 10 years out of date
2016-02-16 07:57:54	DrMcCoy	But it's currently the best option, "network-effect"-wise
2016-02-16 07:58:17	DrMcCoy	Thankfully, the repos being in git, it's easy to move if it's necessary
2016-02-16 07:58:36	Gallomimia	i got the same issue as gnarface
2016-02-16 07:58:55	Gallomimia	learn more than contribute. but it's not the first time i've done that for a project
2016-02-16 07:59:22	Gallomimia	also yes. mistrust for github
2016-02-16 08:01:01	DrMcCoy	When I joined ScummVM back in 2006 to take up the gob engine (Coktel Vision games: Gobliiins, Woodruff and the Schnibble, ...), I learned a lot
2016-02-16 08:01:17	Ysblokje	DrMcCoy, what comp. issues do you expect with c++11?
2016-02-16 08:01:50	DrMcCoy	Ysblokje: For example, my Mac OS X cross-compiler, that produces Mac OS X >= 10.5 binaries on my Linux system, would choke :P
2016-02-16 08:02:11	DrMcCoy	It's a gcc 4.2.1
2016-02-16 08:02:38	Ysblokje	ah, okay.
2016-02-16 08:02:45	gnarface	i agree with the avoiding C++11 for now; you wouldn't be able to run scummvm on a palm pilot if it'd been written in C++11
2016-02-16 08:03:02	DrMcCoy	Hell, ScummVM doesn't even use the STL or exceptions
2016-02-16 08:03:03	*	Ysblokje loves c++11
2016-02-16 08:03:15	gnarface	portability is king
2016-02-16 08:03:18	Ysblokje	saves a few bytes over boost::
2016-02-16 08:03:25	Ysblokje	std:: ;)
2016-02-16 08:03:34	DrMcCoy	lol
2016-02-16 08:03:59	Ysblokje	But I only write stuff for linux systems that have to at some point work on windows. so thats luxery

2016-02-16 08:04:58	DrMcCoy	gnarface: Apropos ScummVM: ScummVM could also use porters for various platforms. Some of the current ones are starting to not have time, not having the device anymore, etc. There's some platforms that didn't have a release in ages now, unfortunately
2016-02-16 08:05:25	DrMcCoy	gnarface: So if you have too much time on your hands, you might want to look there as well
2016-02-16 08:05:43	gnarface	DrMcCoy: well, if the last build still works i dunno why one would need to update it, but my palm tungsten t5 does still work....
2016-02-16 08:06:00	DrMcCoy	gnarface: To get support for more games, for example
2016-02-16 08:06:05	DrMcCoy	And bugfixes

2016-02-16 08:14:51	Ysblokje	well not perse
2016-02-16 08:14:58	Ysblokje	some errors are part of a chain
2016-02-16 08:15:00	madmachinations	Hey everyone, just wondering if anybody has a laptop with a combo 3.5mm audio socket instead of the typical 2? If so have you tried it with a headset and did it give you any bullshit? Mine flat out refuses to detect anything other than the internal microphone.
2016-02-16 08:15:07	Smilex	Ysblokje: chain?
2016-02-16 08:15:21	Ysblokje	You call a function that creates a something
2016-02-16 08:15:50	Ysblokje	if you dont call the destruct for that thing some other things stay too
2016-02-16 08:15:57	Smilex	What? I do a lot of that.
2016-02-16 08:16:15	Smilex	Oh! Yeah I don't deinitialize or free my memory. I let the kernel take care of taht
2016-02-16 08:16:24	Ysblokje	for instance ;)
2016-02-16 08:16:26	Fenix2412	madmachinations, I think that you need a spliter but give me a sec I will ask my friend
2016-02-16 08:16:29	Ysblokje	I saw it in the code
2016-02-16 08:16:40	Ysblokje	but decided to let you find out for your self :D

2016-02-16 08:17:18	Ysblokje	why ?
2016-02-16 08:17:22	Ysblokje	its dirty
2016-02-16 08:17:25	madmachinations	Fenix2412: My headset is a combo connector, in theory it should just work. But when its plugged in my laptop refuses to recognise the microphone at all.
2016-02-16 08:17:31	Ysblokje	wipe your ass so to speak ;0
2016-02-16 08:17:33	gnarface	madmachinations: (i don't have one myself, but this seems to be a more and more common question lately)
2016-02-16 08:18:00	madmachinations	gnarface: I've tried that, it just keeps insisting the device is busy whenever I try and override any of the pins, it also crashes pulse audio.
2016-02-16 08:18:18	Fenix2412	madmachinations, oh ok
2016-02-16 08:18:28	Fenix2412	I was thinking it was just microphone

2016-02-16 08:18:55	Smilex	Ysblokje: Because more code is bad, and much worse than the nothing that happens from not cleaning up my resources
2016-02-16 08:19:11	Fenix2412	gnarface, well my friend is saying it's also tricky on windows to get it to work in combo mode
2016-02-16 08:19:16	madmachinations	Fenix2412: Unfortunately no lol, but thanks for trying to help all the same :)
2016-02-16 08:19:20	Ysblokje	Well returning in the middle of code is also ugly ;)
2016-02-16 08:19:46	Fenix2412	madmachinations, what is your laptop name?
2016-02-16 08:19:55	Smilex	Ysblokje: When the application closes, the kernel also cleanes up everything associated with it. I don't see why I should do that as well
2016-02-16 08:20:05	Smilex	Ysblokje: What?
2016-02-16 08:20:25	madmachinations	gnarface: I have a feeling its an alsa bug, its not a really new laptop, I think this model is a year or two old. Its an Acer ES1-111M
2016-02-16 08:20:39	gnarface	madmachinations: did you ask about this in #alsa?
2016-02-16 08:20:47	Ysblokje	set a retval followed by a break and clean your stuff before main exits
2016-02-16 08:21:06	DrMcCoy	Ah, yes, the "don't use early return, but instead keep nesting those ifs" mindset. I think that's pretty silly

2016-02-16 08:21:59	Ysblokje	because leaving memory in use for the kernel to clean up doesnt work on all OSes ?
2016-02-16 08:22:01	madmachinations	gnarface: I did not, I actually just stopped bothering after the last couple of hours of messing with it and ordered a usb sound card. But I am at least trying to figure out exactly where the problem is still, as it would be nice to have it working without 2 adapters between the headset and the laptop ;P
2016-02-16 08:22:24	Smilex	Ysblokje: No, but it works on the ones I'll be dealing with

2016-02-16 23:14:39	arnej_	I also read that from KDAB earlier today and now I'm hyped again :)

2016-02-16 23:50:41	mirv_	I'd be very surprised if vulkan was released before gdc
2016-02-16 23:50:58	Fenix2412	Hello
2016-02-16 23:51:09	mirv_	only mildly surprise if the bloody thing is unveiled at gdc
2016-02-16 23:51:15	mirv_	*surprised
2016-02-16 23:51:36	dnlbaines	I think it could, gives time for any driver updates etc to be released to support any launch titles
2016-02-16 23:52:28	tadzik	I'm still a naysayer
2016-02-16 23:52:44	tadzik	I still heard nothing more than rumours and people repeating those rumours as facts
2016-02-16 23:52:50	homerj	no, vulkan will be the future of things
2016-02-16 23:52:57	homerj	it's just how hardware works now

2016-02-16 23:56:24	homerj	mesa is an opengl implementation
2016-02-16 23:56:34	mirv_	remains to be seen if mesa will encompass vulkan as a sub-project or not
2016-02-16 23:56:51	Ysblokje	So when you're on MESA you're fucked once again?
2016-02-16 23:56:54	homerj	I'm sure there will be a couple competing implementations
2016-02-16 23:57:06	homerj	Ysblokje, you're thinking gallium

2016-02-16 23:57:18	*	Ysblokje wouldn't know ;)
2016-02-16 23:57:41	mirv_	theoretically, at release, there should be an intel driver to play with
2016-02-16 23:57:50	homerj	graphic stack looks like this.... mesa(opengl) -> galilum3d(talks to hardware) -> drivers
2016-02-16 23:58:13	homerj	that's why you replace mesa with galilum 9, and get d3d 9 support
2016-02-16 23:58:22	homerj	gallium doesn't care about apis
2016-02-16 23:58:32	homerj	you add another statetracker to it and get support for a new spi

2016-02-16 23:58:36	GolBot	homerj meant to say: you add another statetracker to it and get support for a new api
2016-02-16 23:59:12	homerj	it's confusing, because really OpenGL until now is the only real api in town
2016-02-16 23:59:22	Ysblokje	Ehm if gallium talks to hardware, what are the drivers for?
2016-02-16 23:59:38	homerj	gallium talks to the kernel drivers
2016-02-16 23:59:52	dnlbaines	Did AMD announce something about it today?
2016-02-16 23:59:52	dnlbaines	http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20160216_743842.html?ref=rss

2016-02-16 23:59:57	homerj	like an abstration layer
2016-02-17 00:00:35	homerj	so for instance, it's not maintained anymore, but there used to be a glide statetracker
2016-02-17 00:00:40	Ysblokje	homerj,  I forgive you your error earlier ;)
2016-02-17 00:01:40	homerj	so if you used that, then any hardware gallium could talk to, would be accelerated glide
2016-02-17 00:01:57	homerj	it's why gallium 9 works well for wine
2016-02-17 00:02:21	homerj	but wine doesn't want to support it, because it's two different codepaths, one for gallium users, one for everyone else
2016-02-17 00:02:51	tadzik	. o O ( wine-nine )
2016-02-17 00:03:23	homerj	not to mention gallium is linux specific
2016-02-17 00:05:11	homerj	tadzik, yeah
2016-02-17 00:05:33	homerj	it kind of sucks for people wanting to use d3d9 in wine to need a fork, but there's a good reason to not support it
2016-02-17 00:06:47	homerj	although, with vulkan, I'd assume they WILL support that, and have later d3d support though a d3d11/d3d12->vulkan translation

2016-02-17 02:20:09	magamo	Is it known at this time what nvidia drivers that the Vulkan support was introduced?
2016-02-17 02:20:47	magamo	... That came out a tad bit disjointed.  Nvidia claims their drivers support Vulkan.  What version introduced that support, anyone know?
2016-02-17 02:21:13	@Samsai	the new beta driver
2016-02-17 02:21:24	@Samsai	356.something
2016-02-17 02:21:47	magamo	Looks like it was in Linux driver 355.xx
2016-02-17 02:22:21	stqn	that would be nice since it’s the only one I can use :)
2016-02-17 02:22:42	Raven67854	Samsai, It's not new its an older driver :p
2016-02-17 02:23:33	dnlbaines	So apparently only that one special release of 355 supports it
2016-02-17 02:23:44	dnlbaines	So if you have newer releases they dont actually have support

2016-02-17 03:51:38	Ysblokje	okay nvm
2016-02-17 03:51:43	linux_gamer	anyone has done a vulkan demo vid yet? xpander69?
2016-02-17 03:51:43	tadzik	because we got that awesome cross-platform graphics api now

2016-02-17 04:17:33	EddDeDuck	Getting sone grief for beter support on mesa than AMD closed source on XCOM 2 :(
2016-02-17 04:17:37	EddDeDuck	Can’t win
2016-02-17 04:18:08	tumocs	EddDeDuck using mesa is always a win
2016-02-17 04:18:50	EddDeDuck	It is the same for me, Mesa+AMD is a mess for most of my games. I hope this won't be the case for XCOM 2.
2016-02-17 04:18:55	FutureSuture	EddDeDuck, refer that joker to this IRC channel so he can be set straight.
2016-02-17 04:19:03	EddDeDuck	So do I get you right if you say that if at all you will only support AMD on Mesa but not on Crimson?
2016-02-17 04:19:04	EddDeDuck	Becaues for me this would mean that I either would have to switch all the time (all other games I own work *way* better on the prop. drivers) .
2016-02-17 04:19:37	magamo	Agreed.  Even though I'm pretty firmly in the camp of buying nvidia hardware for now, I'm always of the opinion that better support for open solutions is a great thing.

2016-02-17 04:21:39	EddDeDuck	He is also upset as he bought the game before the spec was released and is now saying “OK, but you have to understand that as customers, we should know whether AMD will be supported (and if so, on which drivers) or not before purchasing.”
2016-02-17 04:21:43	EddDeDuck	Shrug :)
2016-02-17 04:21:54	EddDeDuck	Hard to answer that one
2016-02-17 04:22:00	Ysblokje	He's got a point
2016-02-17 04:22:18	EddDeDuck	Well he has a point but that’s not what we did
2016-02-17 04:22:32	EddDeDuck	We didn’t annouce any spec until we could confirm what would be supported
2016-02-17 04:22:55	EddDeDuck	if you buy a game on pre order before any spec is annouced it’s hard to see what we could do
2016-02-17 04:23:04	Ysblokje	true
2016-02-17 04:23:16	magamo	Truth.  One of the reasons I don't preorder much.
2016-02-17 04:23:24	EddDeDuck	I mean we had no clue what the min spec would be, if we could support AMD or not
2016-02-17 04:23:33	EddDeDuck	what about Intel or Nvidia min spec
2016-02-17 04:23:43	Ysblokje	but my guess is that at least one month before the final release, you (and others) should have a pretty decent idea about the requirements right?

2016-02-17 04:24:03	EddDeDuck	Final min spec was signed off 48 hours prior to release :)

2016-02-17 04:26:57	EddDeDuck	Well I guess you could delay XCOM 2 on all platforms for a month ;)
2016-02-17 04:27:07	EddDeDuck	SO you can get the min spec earlier :)
2016-02-17 04:27:13	Ysblokje	neh
2016-02-17 04:28:00	Ysblokje	Well you could have released it (earlier) to testers.
2016-02-17 04:28:14	EddDeDuck	We have an internal QA team
2016-02-17 04:28:14	Ysblokje	But that was out the question I guess
2016-02-17 04:28:31	EddDeDuck	external testers are a sanity test on top of that
2016-02-17 04:28:50	EddDeDuck	External testers would not effect knowing the min spec to any real degree
2016-02-17 04:29:18	Ysblokje	So the QA only in the last 48 hours decided what was good enough? Sounds...weird..
2016-02-17 04:29:26	EddDeDuck	No
2016-02-17 04:29:37	EddDeDuck	In development there are these things called bugs… :)
2016-02-17 04:29:42	EddDeDuck	and these things called fixes....
2016-02-17 04:29:52	Ysblokje	Dont get me wrong, you guys do a really fine job.
2016-02-17 04:29:58	EddDeDuck	You do as many of the second to fix the first ones :)
2016-02-17 04:30:21	EddDeDuck	If you make a call 4 weeks before release then anything you do beyond that point doesn’t matter
2016-02-17 04:30:30	Ysblokje	I never produce bugs *cough*

2016-02-17 04:31:54	EddDeDuck	Basically when you’re on a tight deadline and your aiming at a moving target knowing what the min spec will be ahead of time is tricky.
2016-02-17 04:32:21	EddDeDuck	When you have a port of a game that has shipped already and you have a large window for release then it’s much easier to nnouce spec aheadc of time.

2016-02-17 04:35:07	EddDeDuck	when preload went live
2016-02-17 04:35:23	@Samsai	might be bad to say that as a dev though
2016-02-17 04:35:25	EddDeDuck	So you could still preorder bonus
2016-02-17 04:35:47	EddDeDuck	To be fair XCOM 2 is not a standard release
2016-02-17 04:36:01	DerRidda	There are refunds anyway, so even if somebody pre-orders and can't run it there's no harm done.
2016-02-17 04:36:30	EddDeDuck	It’s only a few poeple and it’s a hard problem to get 100% right
2016-02-17 04:37:00	EddDeDuck	no matter what you do it will be the wrong option for some people’s situation
2016-02-17 04:37:15	EddDeDuck	You just need to try and find the best overall choice
2016-02-17 04:37:20	@Samsai	indeed

2016-02-17 09:37:51	Yakumozo	The problem is that I see screen tearing during  for expample youtube videos, games or chrome site scrolling. I use Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 and updated my nvidia drivers to 316.28.

2016-02-17 12:29:06	gnarface	i know, its a complete joke now, but so was linux, not so long ago
2016-02-17 12:30:19	gnarface	give it another decade or so and i bet we'll see serious strides to abolish proprietary hardware entirely
2016-02-17 12:31:11	No1RL355	open software is easier to make than open hardware. Haiku, Kolibrios and other just-for-fun OS'es confirms it

2016-02-17 12:32:30	gnarface	yes, that's true, but open software also helps enable open hardware.  there's already an *almost* completely open laptop (but it sucks for gaming) and there's a purportedly completely open new server board project (mislabeled "workstation" IMO) based on i think POWER8 chips, actually backed by IMB

2016-02-17 12:59:37	Mneuro	Steam's download speeds are insane
2016-02-17 12:59:48	Mneuro	like either super fast or super slow
2016-02-17 13:00:57	gnarface	Mneuro: they use 3rd party CDNs, not all of which are very high quality.  its been recommended to me in the past (and proven to work fairly reliably) that if you can switch your download locale to somewhere else in the general region, you might have better luck, even if its further away (due to the fact that latency is not material to the download process)
2016-02-17 13:01:25	Mneuro	Hmm maybe I should try dallas
2016-02-17 13:01:41	gnarface	Mneuro: oh you're in the US too?  yes, try dallas.  the LA one is fucking garbage
2016-02-17 13:01:54	gnarface	Mneuro: not only is the LA one garbage, it will occasionally give you back corrupted save files
2016-02-17 13:01:55	Mneuro	I am currently using Minneapolis
2016-02-17 13:01:57	Mneuro	it seems like garbage
2016-02-17 13:02:21	gnarface	dallas seems to be (for now) the best US one
2016-02-17 13:02:28	Mneuro	it's like it caps out at 8.0MB/S
2016-02-17 13:02:37	Mneuro	my speed is 15.0MB/S
2016-02-17 13:03:25	gnarface	heh, well... since i'm in 3rd-world LA, my speed caps at 2MB/s but the LA one will still do worse than that.  definitely try dallas.  there's probably a good reason its the default setting for US accounts
2016-02-17 13:03:50	Mneuro	it's slowed down to around 2MB/sec
2016-02-17 13:03:53	Mneuro	:(
2016-02-17 13:04:30	Mneuro	did a speedtest, getting 125 KB/sec

2016-02-17 13:04:41	gnarface	KB/s??
2016-02-17 13:04:45	gnarface	maybe your problem is local

2016-02-17 13:05:54	gnarface	Mneuro: comcast throttles but NOT 3rd party speed tests.  they're not idiots
2016-02-17 13:06:00	Mneuro	wow seriously?
2016-02-17 13:06:15	gnarface	(though their helpdesk support staff might make it seem otherwise)
2016-02-17 13:06:31	Mneuro	I really hate comcast
2016-02-17 13:06:41	stqn	I can usually dl at 1MB/s from Steam, which is the best my line can do
2016-02-17 13:06:43	gnarface	Mneuro: yea, its flat out illegal.  they've been sued at least twice by the FCC but they always settle out of court
2016-02-17 13:06:45	Mneuro	I have another option but I would get charged way more for less internet
2016-02-17 13:07:55	gnarface	Mneuro: what you gotta decide is whether its still way more for less internet AFTER comcast starts throttling you (i think they throttle after 300GB of download in a month, and also they throttle anything encrypted down to like a pinhole stream.    then they have other obscure rules for how they throttle swarm-stream traffic like torrents and Blizzard Battle.net patching)

2016-02-17 13:09:18	stqn	there are honorable liars?
2016-02-17 13:09:34	gnarface	Mneuro: my current download caps at 2MB/s (not mb/s) but if i set my steam locale to dallas, i almost always actually GET it
2016-02-17 13:09:41	Mneuro	i would go from $80 for 150 megabits and 2000gb data cap to the other company being $130 for 50 megabits and no data cap
2016-02-17 13:09:42	gnarface	stqn: well, theoretically, yes
2016-02-17 13:10:41	Mneuro	Man, I hope Vulkan drivers release soon

2016-02-17 13:11:29	gnarface	Mneuro: just fyi, 2000GB/month is only 6mb/s (NOT MB/s)  how much have you downloaded so far this month? you could have just hit the cap.  this could be nothing to do with steam
2016-02-17 13:11:49	Mneuro	huh?  my cap does not affect my speed
2016-02-17 13:11:58	Mneuro	my speed is 150 megabits per second

2016-02-17 13:13:08	Mneuro	comcast's data cap is just the total amount of GB you are allowed to download per month before they charge you for additional GBs
2016-02-17 13:13:17	gnarface	Mneuro: i'm fairly clear that they throttle after the cap
2016-02-17 13:13:28	Mneuro	I went over last month, they didn't throttle me
2016-02-17 13:13:34	Mneuro	I only had a 1000gb cap
2016-02-17 13:13:38	Mneuro	i monitored it
2016-02-17 13:13:42	gnarface	they don't always police it very well
2016-02-17 13:13:46	gnarface	especially with new customers
2016-02-17 13:13:52	Mneuro	I should repeat, I'm not technically a comcast customer
2016-02-17 13:13:56	Mneuro	My ISP is mediacom
2016-02-17 13:13:59	Mneuro	a subsidiary of comcast
2016-02-17 13:14:13	gnarface	all that would mean is mediacom is powerless to help you if you complain
2016-02-17 13:14:56	gnarface	but i no longer feel sorry for you if you're only paying 80$/month and still getting 8MB/s
2016-02-17 13:15:17	Mneuro	outside of steam I get 15MB/s
2016-02-17 13:15:47	gnarface	i get 2MB/s its my flat out max, and at 98$/month its the cheapest, fastest no-cap hard line you can get in LA
2016-02-17 13:15:57	Mneuro	I don't know if I could live in LA
2016-02-17 13:15:58	gnarface	(in a residentially-zoned building, at least)
2016-02-17 13:15:59	Mneuro	it sounds horrible

2016-02-17 13:17:21	Mneuro	it's not huge, but not small
2016-02-17 13:17:34	gnarface	eh, that's kinda small actually, but if its +1500 i'm legitimately very jealous, at least in the summer when the weather isn't trying to kill you
2016-02-17 13:17:48	Mneuro	yea, winters are nasty here

2016-02-17 13:18:45	gnarface	yea, without roommates its difficult to pull off
2016-02-17 13:18:47	Mneuro	so more money in your paycheck
2016-02-17 13:18:53	gnarface	10% sales tax
2016-02-17 13:18:59	Mneuro	6% here
2016-02-17 13:19:07	gnarface	your gasoline is cheaper too
2016-02-17 13:19:21	Mneuro	its about 1.70 right now for gas here

2016-02-17 13:20:25	Mneuro	there aren't even 1 million people in the entirety of south dakota

2016-02-17 13:21:00	gnarface	the average commute here is maybe still half an hour an hour, but its rarely more than about 7 miles
2016-02-17 13:21:02	Mneuro	the whole town is only 2 or 3 miles
2016-02-17 13:21:18	Mneuro	i think i spend $20 every 2 weeks in gas
2016-02-17 13:21:31	gnarface	most people spend all their commute time basically waiting in line to get into downtown, hollywood, or santa monica

2016-02-17 13:23:17	Mneuro	Having tried a bunch of other distros, I really have a lot of respect for Xubuntu
2016-02-17 13:23:17		[13:23]
2016-02-17 13:23:26	Mneuro	They do a really amazing job
2016-02-17 13:24:09	gnarface	know what worked for me? trying a lot of different distros, then eventually going BACK to debian after i'd gotten really good at linux
2016-02-17 13:24:20	gnarface	then i gained a new appreciation for debian
2016-02-17 13:24:36	gnarface	of course that was before their maintainers were all replaced by evil alien bodysnatchers
2016-02-17 13:25:27	gnarface	i can't claim i know anything about xubuntu though
2016-02-17 13:28:09	Mneuro	I love debian
2016-02-17 13:28:24	Mneuro	I just don't use it
2016-02-17 13:30:19	gnarface	it can get a bit tedious if you need new stuff and quality control at the same time
2016-02-17 13:30:24	gnarface	since they don't seem to accomplish that
2016-02-17 13:30:46	gnarface	but i'm not convinced that ubuntu or any of the derivatives thereof have accomplished it either
2016-02-17 13:31:40	Mneuro	I used Debian Testing for a while
2016-02-17 13:31:41	gnarface	i've been frequently tempted to go back to slackware or gentoo lately, over the whole systemd fiasco, but devuan does so far seem to be showing promise
2016-02-17 13:31:52	Mneuro	It was definitely pretty stable, even thought it was testing
2016-02-17 13:32:17	Mneuro	The distro I "want" to use is Arch, but something always breaks during an update and I don't feel like spending all day fixing issues
2016-02-17 13:33:06	gnarface	*before* systemd i would have said to use debian unstable for gaming rigs, but keep frequent backups, and that debian stable is fine for headless servers, so long as you're competent enough to properly manually backport anything newer than they distribute yourself if you require it
2016-02-17 13:33:24	Mneuro	I don't think systemd affects me
2016-02-17 13:33:32	Mneuro	I don't do anything with it
2016-02-17 13:33:41	Mneuro	and so far it doesn't affect my xubuntu install
2016-02-17 13:34:14	gnarface	yea, re: arch, that's why i had to stop using gentoo.  i really WANTED to be able to make gentoo my only distro, but there were too often really hamfisted breakages that just represented utterly sloppy or non-existent QA; in the end i decided it was better to have old software with security patches than having to risk hosing your install on every update
2016-02-17 13:34:48	Mneuro	I know I shouldn't expect "stable" out of Arch updates, but arch users always claim that updates don't break their system
2016-02-17 13:34:56	Mneuro	but I have had my system break from updates twice on arch in the last year
2016-02-17 13:35:25	gnarface	its hard enough in life to find people capable of being truly honest with *themselves* much less strangers on IRC
2016-02-17 13:35:33	Mneuro	true
2016-02-17 13:36:22	gnarface	i really like the ideas behind arch
2016-02-17 13:36:41	Mneuro	me too, and I think pacman is worlds better than apt
2016-02-17 13:37:08	gnarface	i see it as a slightly saner, more vetran user's gentoo:  better adherence to using open tools already in the ecosystem than rolling their own stuff
2016-02-17 13:37:34	gnarface	but the whole "just suck everything in verbatim from upstream source" is just obviously not gonna help anyone get real work done
2016-02-17 13:38:01	gnarface	unless the "real work" you're trying to get done is testing alpha builds of every single piece of software you need
2016-02-17 13:38:10	Mneuro	I do really love the latest and greatest software, but the first time it gets in the way of me getting work done or just wanting to play a game on steam, i'm done
2016-02-17 13:38:41	gnarface	yea

2016-02-17 13:49:20	gnarface	1997 here
2016-02-17 13:49:43	gnarface	my only regret being that i didn't hear of it in 1992
2016-02-17 13:49:59	Mneuro	I had been interested in linux when I was using Windows XP around 2003 or 2004, but it wasn't until I bought a Vista laptop in 2007 that I was done with windows
2016-02-17 13:50:06	gnarface	also: windows-free since 2000
2016-02-17 13:50:14	Mneuro	unfortunately i'm not windows-free
2016-02-17 13:50:15	gnarface	(since the year 2000, not the windows version)
2016-02-17 13:50:17	Mneuro	we have a windows gaming machine
2016-02-17 13:50:20	Mneuro	hooked to our tv
2016-02-17 13:51:08	Mneuro	It wasn't supposed to be
2016-02-17 13:51:11	Mneuro	It's an alienware steam machine
2016-02-17 13:51:14	gnarface	heh, i'd heard people refer to windows vista as "windows: annoying edition"
2016-02-17 13:51:19	Mneuro	but SteamOS on the alienware machine is horrible
2016-02-17 13:51:33	gnarface	you should try installing debian on that machine
2016-02-17 13:51:46	Mneuro	i installed regular ubuntu and it was okay
2016-02-17 13:52:03	Mneuro	but my fiance wanted Witcher 3 and Dragon Age so windows it is
2016-02-17 13:52:37	gnarface	well, you gotta do what you gotta do
2016-02-17 13:53:05	Mneuro	yea, I bet it will have steamos on it again soon
2016-02-17 13:53:08	gnarface	i still buy stuff from Nintendo frequently
2016-02-17 13:53:13	Mneuro	Windows on a TV is horrible
2016-02-17 13:53:16	gnarface	so there is taint on my soul too
2016-02-17 13:54:07	Mneuro	I actually wish I didn't hate apple with a fiery passion
2016-02-17 13:54:07		[13:54]
2016-02-17 13:54:27	gnarface	nintendo is hardly a champion of fair usage rights or open software, but at least their Unity implementation works better than Linux's
2016-02-17 13:54:30	Mneuro	Then instead of windows I could probably just have a hackintosh
2016-02-17 13:55:44	Mneuro	I hope Vulkan makes steam machines a lot better
2016-02-17 13:55:54	gnarface	i was actually an Apple hater until the original OSX which made me change my mind 100% about them, unfortunately for them, after whatever the release was just after Jaguar, i quickly saw their "planned obsolescence" profit strategy and was quickly fed up with them again
2016-02-17 13:56:13	gnarface	i think its freaking hilarious that Vulkan is "cross-platform, except for Apple" lol
2016-02-17 13:56:21	gnarface	we'll see how that works
2016-02-17 13:57:16	gnarface	and all the iPhone remote-bricking crap
2016-02-17 13:57:20	gnarface	just sad really
2016-02-17 13:57:39	gnarface	i had a bunch of friends who are still apple fanatics to this day
2016-02-17 13:57:41	Mneuro	I admit I use an iPhone
2016-02-17 13:57:45	gnarface	emphasis on *had*
2016-02-17 13:57:48	Mneuro	I just switched from android this past weekend
2016-02-17 13:58:03	Mneuro	I couldn't take buggy android phones anymore
2016-02-17 13:58:03	gnarface	(though i didn't unfriend them all because of their continued loyalty to Apple, it *seems* to be just coincidence)
2016-02-17 13:58:56	gnarface	i'm still using a dumb phone with buttons
2016-02-17 13:59:13	gnarface	its frankly useless i'm just about to cancel it but i keep thinking my grandma might want to actually call me one day
2016-02-17 13:59:23	Mneuro	From my past experiences, android is far too buggy and battery hungry for me
2016-02-17 13:59:50	gnarface	nobody i actually want to talk to anymore can't reach me on my computer
2016-02-17 14:00:01	gnarface	so the phone is just about only used to pay its own bill
2016-02-17 14:00:09	Mneuro	my phone is mainly a podcast machine at work
2016-02-17 14:00:18	gnarface	or send the occasional SMS message when i'm trying to meet someone at a resturant and didn't plan carefully enough
2016-02-17 14:00:32	gnarface	i keep it largely just so if my car breaks down i can call AAA
2016-02-17 14:00:42	gnarface	but even then, its barely worth it
2016-02-17 14:00:48	gnarface	phones are dead tech
2016-02-17 14:01:01	Mneuro	Unfortunately in South Dakota you have to have a cell phone
2016-02-17 14:01:09	Mneuro	your car could break down 50 miles from the nearest town
2016-02-17 14:01:15	gnarface	oh yea, i know all about it

2016-02-17 14:01:36	gnarface	you don't want to be 50 miles outside of town in winter when you could freeze to death before the next person drives by
2016-02-17 14:01:42	Mneuro	and since I only pay $45 for unlimited talk/text and data (first 5GB at LTE speeds) I can't complain
2016-02-17 14:01:48	Mneuro	it makes an amazing podcast machine
2016-02-17 14:04:25	gnarface	maybe i'd like my phone more if i did any podcasts
2016-02-17 14:05:28	gnarface	due to my usage patterns, i bought the phone best for sending text messages (hint: qwerty keyboard, real buttons, NO TOUCHSCREEN)
2016-02-17 14:05:54	Mneuro	that definitely makes sense
2016-02-17 14:08:14	gnarface	mostly anyone i talk to at length in voice that i can't meet in person locally just connects to my mumble server
2016-02-17 14:08:31	gnarface	on average i use about 3 minutes of voice to pay the phone's own bill
2016-02-17 14:09:04	gnarface	and maybe 50-100 SMS messages to other people's phones who connect their IM clients to their phones, when i'm away from my computer and can't IM them from it directly
2016-02-17 14:09:56	gnarface	(working from home makes this all much easier)
2016-02-17 14:09:56		[14:09]
2016-02-17 14:10:22	gnarface	but like i said, i still keep it in case i'm ever driving somewhere and need to call AAA cause my car broke down, or if Grandma wants to reach me
2016-02-17 14:11:00	gnarface	or you know, *occasionally* still (more and more rare) you might have a client who will be insulted if you don't give them your phone number
2016-02-17 14:11:18	gnarface	so rarely, but sometimes its good to have a phone number
2016-02-17 14:11:25	Mneuro	yea
2016-02-17 14:11:33	Mneuro	it's a necessary evil right now
2016-02-17 14:11:35	gnarface	i think phone numbers will die out completely in our lifetimes though
2016-02-17 14:11:40	Mneuro	I probably won't have a phone in the next year or two
2016-02-17 14:12:19	gnarface	i think phones will remain, but the whole phone call routing stuff is just primitive and not really necessary
2016-02-17 14:12:33	gnarface	its redundant to current internet technology
2016-02-17 14:13:49	gnarface	the concept that internet tech is less reliable is less of a physical fact and more just anecdotal incidents based on the fact we so far haven't put the same reliability regulations on "internet" services that we previously did on the phone carriers
2016-02-17 14:14:12	gnarface	there's no practical reason for it anyway either
2016-02-17 14:14:22	gnarface	i think ISPs should be classified as common carriers
2016-02-17 14:14:34	gnarface	and regulated like city water and electricity
2016-02-17 14:14:36	Mneuro	definitely
2016-02-17 14:15:47	gnarface	the problems with most big ISPs today getting away with such misbehaviors as Comcast et al, is that they assume all the RIGHTS of common carriers, without any of the RESTRICTIONS
2016-02-17 14:16:47	gnarface	the law clearly states they CAN'T have it both ways
2016-02-17 14:16:59	 < 	Marezz (~Marezz@unaffiliated/marezz) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-17 14:17:10	gnarface	but ... for some reason they've already accumulated enough money to seemingly bully the FCC around instead of just having to suck it up and do their jobs right
2016-02-17 14:17:26	Mneuro	it's because Mediacom is too large
2016-02-17 14:17:27	gnarface	am i bitter about this? hell yes
2016-02-17 14:17:29	Mneuro	err, comcast
2016-02-17 14:18:35	gnarface	well, its not just mediacom
2016-02-17 14:18:41	gnarface	there's a handful of very bad players
2016-02-17 14:18:58	gnarface	but unfortunately they're also the ones who effectively have monopolies in the largest amount of US territory
2016-02-17 14:19:02	Mneuro	wow, retroarch added vulkan to it's backend today
2016-02-17 14:19:24	gnarface	and the worst ones started as *cable* companies, which adds insult to injury, because those networks were NEVER designed for data
2016-02-17 14:19:37	gnarface	well, not that the old copper wires were either, strictly speaking
2016-02-17 14:19:54	gnarface	but coax networks represent an additional security issue at the physical level

2016-02-17 14:21:13	Mneuro	So it feels a bit dirt but I'm not using wine for 2 windows games
2016-02-17 14:21:20	Mneuro	the only 2 I really needed from my windows days
2016-02-17 14:21:31	 > 	Marezz (~Marezz@unaffiliated/marezz) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-02-17 14:21:34	Mneuro	Everquest and League of Legends
2016-02-17 14:21:39	Mneuro	both run flawlessly
2016-02-17 14:21:56	gnarface	hmm. yea the very popular stuff is generally pretty well supported in wine
2016-02-17 14:22:21	gnarface	not sure about "flawlessly" but usually you can get like 90% of the high-quality graphics with only about a 50-75% hit to your framerates
2016-02-17 14:22:24	Mneuro	I had basically given up on wine a few years ago
2016-02-17 14:23:22	gnarface	its a big mess but they're really doing about as well as they possibly can while dodging legal restrictions
2016-02-17 14:24:06	gnarface	microsoft's eula on directx for example makes it nearly impossible for anyone who actually knows shit about directx to contribute to wine
2016-02-17 14:24:23	gnarface	it literally legally *has* to only be made from code written by people who don't know what the fuck they're doing
2016-02-17 14:24:35	gnarface	considering that, it works AMAZINGLY well
2016-02-17 14:24:46	Mneuro	yea i'm surprised with these 2 games
2016-02-17 14:24:50	Mneuro	I'm not sure that I'll try any others
2016-02-17 14:24:57	Mneuro	on Steam, if it's not linux native I don't bother
2016-02-17 14:24:57		[14:24]
2016-02-17 14:25:38	gnarface	where there is a will there is a way, the very popular stuff works pretty well in wine through sheer brute force and reverse engineering, but only for while its actually popular enough that the developers can keep getting bug reports from actual users
2016-02-17 14:26:21	 > 	mETz (~DermETz@port-25074.pppoe.wtnet.de) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-02-17 14:26:57	gnarface	so while current games like EQ, LoL, WoW, SC2, D3, etc, still work, games from just 5-10 years ago often stopped working the year later, and getting them working in wine requires actually USING the wine version from that long ago
2016-02-17 14:27:21	gnarface	for wine to work for everything, it relies on users contributing good bug reports
2016-02-17 14:27:30	Mneuro	I like playonlinux
2016-02-17 14:27:33	gnarface	as soon as a game stops being played, regressions creep in
2016-02-17 14:27:39	Mneuro	it basically let's you pick a version of wine that is known to work
2016-02-17 14:27:50	gnarface	yea, playonlinux seems like the right idea, i just wish they could pull their job off without introducing MORE bugs
2016-02-17 14:28:08	Mneuro	it made LoL a one click install
2016-02-17 14:28:08	gnarface	maybe they've gotten better lately
2016-02-17 14:28:12	Mneuro	I was impressed
2016-02-17 14:28:35	Marezz	gnarface, do you know to troubleshoot kernel panics? xD
2016-02-17 14:28:43	gnarface	i do admit i've had to learn *WAY* too much about wine just to play games
2016-02-17 14:28:52	gnarface	Marezz: occasionally, pastebin it?
2016-02-17 14:29:05	Marezz	gnarface, I cant, it wont let me xD http://i.imgur.com/6iRwY0U.jpg
2016-02-17 14:29:05	GolBot	[ jpeg (3264 x 2448) ]
2016-02-17 14:29:14	gnarface	Marezz: there's only a small set of things that can cause a kernel panic
2016-02-17 14:30:08	gnarface	Marezz: i'd put my money on your initrd.img not having your filesystem driver in it, or you forgot to load your initrd.img with your new grub config
2016-02-17 14:30:39	gnarface	Marezz: "unable to mount root fs" is pretty conclusive in that regard; but its possible your'e just pointing it at the wrong partition too
2016-02-17 14:30:43	Marezz	gnarface, probably grub, since i had to install and use grub 2
2016-02-17 14:30:56	Marezz	could not find a solution to add windows to its menu for dualboot
2016-02-17 14:31:22	gnarface	Marezz: there's a way but last time i had to do it was in lilo, for windows 95.  i'm sure its changed since then
2016-02-17 14:31:32	Marezz	heheh
2016-02-17 14:32:11	gnarface	Marezz: keep that image handy, try to get help from the grub people maybe?
2016-02-17 14:32:12	Marezz	sigh, source distros arent all that what ppl say >.< it seems im a binary person after all :D
2016-02-17 14:32:23	Marezz	its going to get wiped
2016-02-17 14:32:36	gnarface	Marezz: noooo!!!!
2016-02-17 14:32:41	gnarface	Marezz: don't panic and wipe it!
2016-02-17 14:33:12	gnarface	Marezz: go into #grub and try to get help, probably this is a very simple grub or initrd.img misconfiguration you can fix easily i just don't know how myself
2016-02-17 14:33:19	Marezz	but what am i supposed to do with it? i cant boot my os..
2016-02-17 14:33:34	gnarface	Marezz: well you're in IRC now, you can probably repair it
2016-02-17 14:33:53	gnarface	Marezz: you can repair it with a livecd/usb image
2016-02-17 14:33:59	Marezz	oh
2016-02-17 14:34:39	gnarface	Marezz: in the future, you can avoid this type of problem by statically compiling your root filesystem driver into the kernel instead of loading it as a module, in the old days that's what i'd do.  eventually i just learned to avoid making a mess...
2016-02-17 14:35:15	gnarface	Marezz: in the old days, i'd always make sure 3 drivers were NOT modules: 1) ethernet 2) filesystem 3) soundcard
2016-02-17 14:35:18	Marezz	gnarface, well its a precompiled debian kernel that they have in funtoo so ppl can get going
2016-02-17 14:35:48	gnarface	Marezz: i know.  so maybe you just messed up one line in the grub config and forgot to load the initrd.img, or maybe you forgot to update the initrd.img with the new kernel's drivers?
2016-02-17 14:36:40	Marezz	Well I dont remember doing that last time and it worked without problems
2016-02-17 14:36:45	gnarface	Marezz: or maybe you messed up the grub line that tells it what partition to try to boot from; i see you have it set to block (0,0) ... that could very well be wrong.  you have to get those numbers right, the ones in parenthesis
2016-02-17 14:36:54	Marezz	it probably is grub related since i didnt use grub 2 last time
2016-02-17 14:37:04	gnarface	Marezz: well i wasn't watching what you did, so i can only speculate
2016-02-17 14:37:28	gnarface	Marezz: next time you do something this crazy, you should livestream it to hitbox.tv then i can stop you before you make any gratuitous errors :-(
2016-02-17 14:37:36	Marezz	i had someone help me with manual grub boot entry config last time so i did it manually. this time it was grub 2 with os prober
2016-02-17 14:37:56	gnarface	Marezz: i fucking HATE grub2
2016-02-17 14:38:00	Marezz	are you a gentoo person? or just debian?
2016-02-17 14:38:07	Marezz	well now i hate it as well lol :)
2016-02-17 14:38:28	gnarface	Marezz: mostly debian/devuan; haven't used gentoo since about 2007 or 2008 i think, but grub2 should be the same everwhere
2016-02-17 14:38:48	gnarface	Marezz: what's probably different is the tools you use to make the initrd.img and the kernel
2016-02-17 14:39:06	Marezz	What's your honest opinion on source distros? Are they worth the hassle?
2016-02-17 14:40:08	gnarface	no
2016-02-17 14:40:08		[14:40]
2016-02-17 14:40:56	gnarface	i mean, yes, if you want to learn alot about linux real fast the hard way by breaking stuff and having to start over alot
2016-02-17 14:41:30	gnarface	but its the equivalent to trying to teach a 5-year-old to swim by throwing them into the deep end of an olympic swimming pool and then laughing while they thrash around and almost drown themselves
2016-02-17 14:42:04	gnarface	i don't sense from you that you have that much willpower
2016-02-17 14:42:08	gnarface	and frankly i don't either
2016-02-17 14:42:15	gnarface	or i'd still be using gentoo
2016-02-17 14:42:36	Marezz	debian/devuan is just so much easier, im used to apt-get :(
2016-02-17 14:42:50	gnarface	but for example if i was hired to teach a CLASS on linux, i'd pick a source distro like arch or gentoo for sure
2016-02-17 14:42:51	Marezz	but i hate that it comes with alot of stupidly packaged packages >.<
2016-02-17 14:43:22	Mneuro	Alien: Isolation is so good, but it makes me want to cry in a corner
2016-02-17 14:43:42	gnarface	haha, that's quite an endorsement, Mneuro
2016-02-17 14:44:01	Mneuro	when you can see the save point but the alien pops out
2016-02-17 14:44:09	Mneuro	it makes you want to cry
2016-02-17 14:46:42	Mneuro	So alcoholic root beer is pretty amazing
2016-02-17 14:46:49	Mneuro	i don't drink often but this is pretty good
2016-02-17 14:46:50	gnarface	Marezz: maybe grub or arch's IRC channels can help you.  don't panic and delete it all yet
2016-02-17 14:47:00	Marezz	well 5am, i hate not being able to sleep properly. going to try and get some rest
2016-02-17 14:47:07	gnarface	time for me to get some dinner
2016-02-17 14:47:09	Marezz	gnarface, thanks for the help bud, see you tomorrow
2016-02-17 14:47:11	gnarface	peace out y'll

2016-02-17 19:46:06	EddDeDuck	So much Vulkan to read
2016-02-17 19:46:15	EddDeDuck	600 pages of spec
2016-02-17 19:46:35	EddDeDuck	That said it’s pretty much very similar to AMD’s Mantle
2016-02-17 19:46:41	gnarface	i'm still expecting them to scrap it entirely before the end of the year and say "woops"
2016-02-17 19:47:51	gnarface	basically

2016-02-17 19:53:11	@Samsai	i just don't see them scrapping the spec at all

2016-02-17 19:57:39	@Samsai	what are you citing as your source for these performance issues?

2016-02-17 19:57:42	@Samsai	talos principle?
2016-02-17 19:58:12	gnarface	i'm not citing any sources, but if either one had any chance of success at anything other than being a momentary distraction, Microsoft would have already sued them
2016-02-17 19:59:32	@Samsai	so... you are saying that vulkan has no chance because if it had microsoft would sue them for creating a new rendering API?
2016-02-17 19:59:46	@Samsai	hmm... that explains why the consoles rely on opengl and directx
2016-02-17 19:59:51	@Samsai	oh wait
2016-02-17 20:00:10	gnarface	what you've got to separate from reality is how much you WANT it to succeed
2016-02-17 20:00:48	@Samsai	i simply don't see a reason for it to not succeed
2016-02-17 20:00:50	@NaughtySquid	phoronix is still claiming he has insider info on a game
2016-02-17 20:00:51	@NaughtySquid	<_<
2016-02-17 20:01:17	gnarface	Samsai: i'll say it again, I WANT TO BE WRONG ABOUT THIS, but i'm not holding my breath this time.  i'm too old and tired.  i've seen this game too many times
2016-02-17 20:01:42	@Samsai	well, i suppose a pessimist is never disappointed
2016-02-17 20:01:53	@Samsai	but they also have a shorter life expectancy so that's also a thing
2016-02-17 20:02:02	@NaughtySquid	wow the tinfoil hats are out already about Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:02:16	gnarface	Samsai: lol, you'd think that, but you'd be surprised
2016-02-17 20:02:16	EddDeDuck	I was saying people need to dial back on the hype train
2016-02-17 20:02:27	@NaughtySquid	failure to deliver on performance? if you're on about talos benchmark, the developers said it themselves they haven't even done multi-threading in it
2016-02-17 20:02:43	@NaughtySquid	they aren't excluding os x either, apple didnt want it?
2016-02-17 20:02:50	EddDeDuck	Vulkan is defintely a better base than GL if you want low level perfomance for AAA titles but it’s still damn complex so will take time to shake out
2016-02-17 20:02:59	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-02-17 20:03:06	EddDeDuck	Drivers are jjst about working nothing more
2016-02-17 20:03:07	@NaughtySquid	like everything new, takes time
2016-02-17 20:03:26	EddDeDuck	spec is just about sighed off (but has loads of quetsions, holes etc that wil need filling in over time)
2016-02-17 20:03:27	@NaughtySquid	also
2016-02-17 20:03:33	@Samsai	i believe i have my hype under control
2016-02-17 20:03:35	@NaughtySquid	i think phoronix is confused about what gol does
2016-02-17 20:03:37	*	gnarface tries to be as pessimistic as physically possible, but somehow frequently still gets disappointed 
2016-02-17 20:04:03	@Samsai	but i am also not willing to simply call vulkan DOA on day 2 without a single reason to believe it is
2016-02-17 20:04:18	gnarface	Samsai: for me its about patterns
2016-02-17 20:04:23	EddDeDuck	Also more importantly Vulcan isn’t always faster than GL just like DX12 isn’t always faster than DX9
2016-02-17 20:04:28	@NaughtySquid	"Or in looking at your site today, all your Vulkan coverage seems to be well after the fact. " - phoronix about gol
2016-02-17 20:04:39	@NaughtySquid	it's not a race for gol for advert revenue heh
2016-02-17 20:04:58	@NaughtySquid	"My track record over the past 12 years pretty much shows I do get the job done with rather high accuracy while not everyone may agree with my tactics / methods" - because his tactics are often baiting and lying
2016-02-17 20:04:59	@Samsai	EddDeDuck, in optimal scenarios that is absolutely correct
2016-02-17 20:05:20	gnarface	Samsai: me, pronouncing Vulkan DOA would not be as easy if i'd been born the day before it was released.  a large part of my opinion is based on previous, unrelated, but statistically relevant events
2016-02-17 20:05:36	EddDeDuck	Vulcan has potentially improvemnts in the area of CPU usage
2016-02-17 20:06:00	EddDeDuck	It also by virtue of being newer has less legacy code and is designed wiht more modern architure in mind
2016-02-17 20:06:10	gnarface	nah they'll never let it actually save cpu cycles; that would inhibit new cpu sales
2016-02-17 20:06:25	gnarface	they'll be bribed by intel to stop that shit s.t.a.t.
2016-02-17 20:06:31	sigz	vulKan
2016-02-17 20:06:31		[20:06]
2016-02-17 20:06:31	@Samsai	gnarface, then dx12 would have never been made
2016-02-17 20:06:32	EddDeDuck	It will save CPU cycles for sure gnarface
2016-02-17 20:06:44	EddDeDuck	Because game devs will then use them all on beter physics, AI etc
2016-02-17 20:06:55	sigz	Edd you really don't like the K :p
2016-02-17 20:07:08	sigz	I already saw you a couple of times about this
2016-02-17 20:07:18	@NaughtySquid	gnarface: it has all ready been shown to save on cpu, intel even demod that fact
2016-02-17 20:07:20	EddDeDuck	Habit and autocorrect :p
2016-02-17 20:07:28	sebbu	after my new laptop, the bottleneck became the internet connection :( :'(
2016-02-17 20:07:33	EddDeDuck	As soon as you say we saved 20% CPU a game dev will say cool we can use that for XXX instead
2016-02-17 20:07:35	@Samsai	AMD also want to push these new APIs
2016-02-17 20:07:38	EddDeDuck	I know we do :)
2016-02-17 20:07:43	@Samsai	because they rely more on multi-core performance
2016-02-17 20:09:11	@NaughtySquid	i dunno why i bother commenting on phoronix forum
2016-02-17 20:09:22	@NaughtySquid	the guy is full of shit and will never change his tactics
2016-02-17 20:09:40	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, just yesterday you said you'd stop :P
2016-02-17 20:09:49	@NaughtySquid	until he pulled more shit Samsai
2016-02-17 20:09:52	EddDeDuck	I’d just walk away and take the high road
2016-02-17 20:10:01	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: sometimes i just can't :P
2016-02-17 20:10:13	EddDeDuck	I know it’s easy to get draw into a debate I can be guilty myself
2016-02-17 20:10:17	FutureSuture	EddDeDuck went from Vulkan to Vulcan and back to Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:10:34	EddDeDuck	but like Moon Hoaxers sometimes people don’t want to see the truth
2016-02-17 20:10:50	FutureSuture	What's a moon hoaxer?
2016-02-17 20:10:56	@NaughtySquid	just people claiming them have "secret anonymous sources" really fucks me off, when all they do is include info from SteamDB and don't even link to it
2016-02-17 20:11:00	gnarface	if this was Vegas, i'd be putting my $50 on vulkan and mantle both failing utterly, just for the record.  but again, WOULD like to be wrong
2016-02-17 20:11:03	@Samsai	FutureSuture, they believe man never made it to moon
2016-02-17 20:11:08	@NaughtySquid	he's so scared of losing visitors he wont even link to steamdb
2016-02-17 20:11:09	*	pdq thinks the moon is made of cheese
2016-02-17 20:11:15	FutureSuture	Ah, so that's the term used for such people
2016-02-17 20:11:34	*	FutureSuture thinks pdq is made of cheese.
2016-02-17 20:11:40	pdq	mmm
2016-02-17 20:11:52	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture is still arguing on the steam forums i see :P
2016-02-17 20:12:01	@NaughtySquid	we all have a place we like to argue heh
2016-02-17 20:12:03	EddDeDuck	I don’t think Vulkan will fail but I do think it won’t suplant DX12 as the weapon of choice for most AAA developers in the short term.
2016-02-17 20:12:16	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, yea, I do it every couple of weeks. Guy is a massive hypocrite.
2016-02-17 20:12:34	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: happens, im the same with phoronix :P
2016-02-17 20:12:42	pdq	i've been on the vulkan hype train since august 2014 :P
2016-02-17 20:12:46	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, you argue with Michael?
2016-02-17 20:12:54	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: all the time

2016-02-17 20:13:12	@NaughtySquid	see the gif, perfection
2016-02-17 20:13:12	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, yea, you call him out, but does he talk back?
2016-02-17 20:13:17	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: he did this time
2016-02-17 20:13:18	@NaughtySquid	:D
2016-02-17 20:13:23	EddDeDuck	^^ get some popcorn
2016-02-17 20:13:23	@NaughtySquid	i finally baited him into reply to me
2016-02-17 20:13:24	FutureSuture	That gif xDDDDDD
2016-02-17 20:13:26	@NaughtySquid	and it's hilarious
2016-02-17 20:13:52	pdq	if it's a secret why is not a secret
2016-02-17 20:14:23	@NaughtySquid	pdq: he claims to have insider info on tomb raider from an anon source, then mentions steamdb and that's all he did, didn't even link to steamdbn

2016-02-17 20:14:36	@NaughtySquid	hilarious really
2016-02-17 20:14:42	gnarface	OH wait INTEL says Vulkan will save cpu cycles????! come on guys.
2016-02-17 20:14:50	gnarface	you can't be THAT naive
2016-02-17 20:15:18	EddDeDuck	The fact Vulcan saves CPU is pretty much fact
2016-02-17 20:15:40	EddDeDuck	Just like DX12, some of the high end Nvidia stuff in 4.5 AZO etc
2016-02-17 20:15:54	EddDeDuck	It’s basically removing driver overhead (which saves CPU cyles)
2016-02-17 20:16:14	EddDeDuck	However as always the catch is coding in a way that takes advatange of this and gains performance
2016-02-17 20:16:23	sebbu	gnarface, and it'll make internet faster =)
2016-02-17 20:16:44	@Samsai	well, you can always write in a way that wastes CPU cycles
2016-02-17 20:16:48	sebbu	maybe my ping will go under 200ms
2016-02-17 20:16:50	EddDeDuck	Not a free lunch more a if you work very hard you can how get a beter solution than before kinda thing
2016-02-17 20:16:59	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: well its not just removing overhead, its the multi-threading which OpenGL just doesn't do right?
2016-02-17 20:17:17	EddDeDuck	We’ve had MT GL for years on Apple it’s more than just that
2016-02-17 20:17:24	EddDeDuck	It’s about rmeoving dirver sync points
2016-02-17 20:17:29	@NaughtySquid	on apple yeah, not Linux :P
2016-02-17 20:17:48	sigz	does the nvidia driver 361.28 supports vulkan ? ( nvidia published the 355 compatible driver, don't know if they included it in following releases )
2016-02-17 20:17:49	@Samsai	well, nvidia has some multithreading in their opengl driver
2016-02-17 20:18:07	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: which only works in specific games and has to be manually enabled though remember
2016-02-17 20:18:11	@NaughtySquid	some games it makes worse
2016-02-17 20:18:18	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, that is true
2016-02-17 20:18:50	@NaughtySquid	which is a specific reason why Vulkan is better than OpenGL, it's one of the reasons it was made after all
2016-02-17 20:19:11	pdq	maximum performance graphics
2016-02-17 20:19:48	pdq	^^ i said that in coming attractions movie voice by the way
2016-02-17 20:20:29	@Samsai	hopefully talos devs optimize the renderer a little and bring it to linux soon
2016-02-17 20:20:49	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: well, it will be more interesting when they add in more multi-threading
2016-02-17 20:20:52	*	gnarface just waits for the other shoe to drop and you all find out that to get "maximum use" of Vulkan you all have to buy the new as-yet-to-be-released Intel CPU, maybe they'll call it the i8 just for fun
2016-02-17 20:20:57	@NaughtySquid	then we will see what Vulkan can do
2016-02-17 20:21:00	@Samsai	it's worth noting however that even in its current non-multithreaded state it beats opengl
2016-02-17 20:21:05	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-02-17 20:21:09	@NaughtySquid	that's quite important
2016-02-17 20:23:21	pdq	i wonder if dota 2 will be 1st game to actually utilize it since steamdb has that dota2 vulkan id
2016-02-17 20:23:21		[20:23]
2016-02-17 20:23:39	pdq	like not just use it like talos did
2016-02-17 20:23:54	@Samsai	i would say it's quite likely
2016-02-17 20:24:32	@NaughtySquid	to use what pdq? since Talos already uses Vulkan it has beat everyone :P
2016-02-17 20:24:45	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, runs slower than dx11
2016-02-17 20:24:55	pdq	it doesn't utilize the multi threading etc or any of the features, it is 'just working so far'
2016-02-17 20:25:16	pdq	yeah which still beats opengl in the benchmarks whic his cool
2016-02-17 20:25:47	@NaughtySquid	considering they have the basics down
2016-02-17 20:25:53	@NaughtySquid	i imagine it will do it fully before others
2016-02-17 20:26:08	@NaughtySquid	valve will probably wait for it to be in stable drivers
2016-02-17 20:26:16	@Samsai	hmm, i don't think so
2016-02-17 20:26:19	@NaughtySquid	since dota 2 is such a big game for them
2016-02-17 20:26:27	@Samsai	i think valve wants to put out as much vulkan stuff in as short time as possible
2016-02-17 20:26:40	pdq	maybe another beta or a new option in video settings?
2016-02-17 20:26:45	@Samsai	especially stuff that showcases vulkan's potential
2016-02-17 20:27:01	pdq	my fav game is csgo for sure that's waht i'm looking forward to, source2 and vulkan :]
2016-02-17 20:27:42	EddDeDuck	Basica understanding / overview
2016-02-17 20:27:43	EddDeDuck	OpenGL - higher level so a little less optmisation possible but you gain boosts from driver improvements and new hardware
2016-02-17 20:27:43	EddDeDuck	Vulkan - Lower level so much more potential for performance but easier to make mistakes, also new hardware will require the game to be reoptimsed per hardware as the drivers no longer do this for you.
2016-02-17 20:27:59	JayVii	i agree. Valve might put out an opt-in Beta for Dota2-Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:28:04	JayVii	that would be cool
2016-02-17 20:28:28	pdq	i wish i liked dota as much as csgo but still very cool yeah, i jealous of their source 2

2016-02-17 20:29:23	@NaughtySquid	more talos vulkan info
2016-02-17 20:29:24	JayVii	i always wondered, why the Windowsversions of Valve games remain directX, when all of valve's benchmarks show that OpenGL performs better for their games (for example L4D2)
2016-02-17 20:30:29	pdq	i thoguht they still use dx to opengl wrapper for all their games
2016-02-17 20:30:43	@NaughtySquid	pdq: dota 2 is native opengl
2016-02-17 20:31:01	pdq	but only now cause of soruce 2 ?
2016-02-17 20:31:04	pdq	source 2
2016-02-17 20:31:31	pdq	source and all gld src still use the togl?
2016-02-17 20:31:49	@NaughtySquid	yes
2016-02-17 20:32:00	 - 	saiGone is now known as sairuk
2016-02-17 20:32:05	@NaughtySquid	performance in dota 2 is much better now with native opengl too
2016-02-17 20:32:10	pdq	i can't wait for all their games to be native source 2/opengl/vulkan :)
2016-02-17 20:32:31	pdq	yeah, it seems like it is coming along
2016-02-17 20:34:51	JayVii	yeah. Dota2 now performs reasonably well on my crappy old GPU even with free drivers
2016-02-17 20:35:11	JayVii	i pretty much get the same performance as i would with Catalyst
2016-02-17 20:35:19	pdq	sweet
2016-02-17 20:35:22	JayVii	which is kinda odd, but i'm not complaining
2016-02-17 20:36:42	frankyboy_	JayVii, you mean that redist folder?
2016-02-17 20:37:30	JayVii	sorry?

2016-02-18 09:57:37	gnarface	stqn: that supports my theory actually
2016-02-18 09:58:04	stqn	it doesn’t use sdl2 though, or loads it dynamically

2016-02-18 09:58:29	gnarface	stqn: well my theory may actually be valid for other libraries besides SDL2

2016-02-18 09:59:08	stqn	I’m tired of these libs issues… the system linux uses doesn’t work for binary distribution
2016-02-18 09:59:19	gnarface	stqn: basically, steam is sticking its own version of some library in there, but its not compatible with the rest of your system.  when you run the game from the terminal, the proper version of that library that is distributed with your distro gets loaded instead of whatever junk steamos version steam put in
2016-02-18 09:59:24	stqn	nobody understands what’s going on
2016-02-18 09:59:52	stqn	sure.
2016-02-18 10:00:08	stqn	but some unity games still work, many other games still work
2016-02-18 10:00:34	gnarface	right, because many of those developers actually ARE smart enough to bypass steam's library and bundle their OWN that's more generally compatible

2016-02-18 10:00:54	stqn	hm maybe, although for unity games I doubt that :]
2016-02-18 10:01:08	gnarface	in either case, if you can figure out which library it is, you can just force its use instead from the steam launcher with LD_PRELOAD

2016-02-18 10:03:50	gnarface	stqn: for example, when bioshock infinite broke for me a while back due to steam's libsdl2 being updated and bioshock infinite not being packaged with its own yet, putting this in my steam launcher options fixed it for me, by forcing bioshock infinite to use the debian version instead: LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0.2.0" %command%
2016-02-18 10:04:40	gnarface	stqn: afterwards i went through all my other games to try to figure out why they worked when BI didn't, and i discovered that unlike BI, the developers of all the *other* games had already anticipated steam's broken libsdl2 and put their OWN version in with the game data itself
2016-02-18 10:05:43	gnarface	stqn: i'd bet this is the exact same situation your'e in right now - maybe the exact library isn't libsdl2, but it could be, and either way the breakage is probably formulaically similar to fix,
2016-02-18 10:07:00	stqn	interesting
2016-02-18 10:07:34	stqn	too bad finding the culprit is so tedious
2016-02-18 10:07:45	gnarface	stqn: i also required the exact same fix for Battleblock Theater.  the steam client's default was version 0.2.1, which was a version that only worked on ubuntu
2016-02-18 10:08:12	gnarface	stqn: i'd say its worth a gamble to try this yourself on your game, it can't hurt
2016-02-18 10:08:12		[10:08]
2016-02-18 10:08:33	stqn	I’m also tired of the steam games being hidden is such a layer of subdirectories :p
2016-02-18 10:08:49	gnarface	stqn: figure out which sdl2 version your distro is using, and ld_preload it like i did, there's a good chance it'll turn out to be a lucky guess

2016-02-18 10:09:29	gnarface	stqn: yes i don't like the nightmarish mess the steam client's subdirectory structures are either
2016-02-18 10:10:49	stqn	quick check: yes, paint it back, a unity game that works, uses ld_library_path to use its own libs

2016-02-18 10:11:53	stqn	but the hive doesn’t either, and yet works
2016-02-18 10:12:07	gnarface	stqn: yea, the situation as i gathered it after WEEKS of pulling teeth with the support staff of various porters is that valve has their own library versions in the steam client that are separate from the distro's versions which they offer for "maximum compatibility" and heavily encourage all the developers to rely on, but most the developers have discovered its all a lie and have learned to bundle their own
2016-02-18 10:12:33	gnarface	sometimes the steam client versions work, sometimes they don't
2016-02-18 10:12:49	gnarface	they don't track non-steamos distros very well for compatibility issues therein, is the basic issue

2016-02-18 10:46:50	gnarface	i was enabling the forced composition pipeline to try to fix some other bugs i was having related to compositing
2016-02-18 10:46:59	gnarface	it didn't work, made something else break or made it break differently
2016-02-18 10:47:02	Mneuro	what desktop environment are you using?
2016-02-18 10:47:06	gnarface	eventually i just gave up on compositing altogether
2016-02-18 10:47:35	gnarface	i'm using e17 but i've no reason to believe that any compositing setup would be materially different except perhaps in performance
2016-02-18 10:47:51	gnarface	with e17 at least it can be disabled
2016-02-18 10:48:08	Mneuro	Maybe I should run xfce without compositing and with vsync in games then

2016-02-18 11:20:09	frankyboy_	lads, what you think about gold linker aka ld.gold?
2016-02-18 11:20:25	stqn	nothing, but they say it’s good
2016-02-18 11:20:29	stqn	never used it myself
2016-02-18 11:21:07	stqn	was it for linking huge code bases that it was recommended?

2016-02-18 11:23:06	frankyboy_	there is workaround to use dynamic linker to load steam if there is issues with steam runtime
2016-02-18 11:23:22	frankyboy_	so i think is gold one will improve perfomance?
2016-02-18 11:23:38	stqn	uh
2016-02-18 11:23:43	stqn	I’m tired.
2016-02-18 11:23:50	frankyboy_	lol me too :D
2016-02-18 11:24:27	stqn	I haven’t had a good game to play in a while

2016-02-18 11:26:31	stqn	I had already read about the modem or whatever chip thing
2016-02-18 11:27:08	frankyboy_	also will be there goty edition of total war attila... what are your thoughts?
2016-02-18 11:27:19	stqn	I don’t like these games
2016-02-18 11:27:28	stqn	dunno about any goty

2016-02-18 11:28:24	stqn	so… now I just click "not interested"
2016-02-18 11:28:27	frankyboy_	what keyboard you have?
2016-02-18 11:28:30	stqn	bépo
2016-02-18 11:28:50	stqn	I mean a bépo layout. The kb is a Typematrix.
2016-02-18 11:29:41	frankyboy_	are these kyeboards slim types?
2016-02-18 11:30:00	stqn	sort of

2016-02-18 11:32:33	frankyboy_	i am afraid to play ladder, because i spent so much time in sc:bw lol
2016-02-18 11:33:16	frankyboy_	so just co-op missions to train a bit of control to be more successfull in brutal campaing :D
2016-02-18 11:33:24	stqn	I bought starcraft + broodwar a long time ago, but never got to play broodwar (which was why I bought the game)
2016-02-18 11:33:51	stqn	and running the game now is too much work…
2016-02-18 11:33:53	frankyboy_	ye, brood war is epic
2016-02-18 11:34:37	stqn	it’s not adapted for current screens, there is a patch but sigh… maybe it will work, maybe not…
2016-02-18 11:34:55	frankyboy_	according to winehq it works
2016-02-18 11:35:25	frankyboy_	but after sc2 i can't look at brood war pixels =\
2016-02-18 11:36:15	frankyboy_	stqn, i think bw will launch perfectly in wine's emulated desktop
2016-02-18 11:36:25	stqn	and I can zoom that?
2016-02-18 11:36:38	stqn	because the original 800×600 is really small
2016-02-18 11:36:55	stqn	(or was it 640×480?)
2016-02-18 11:37:22	frankyboy_	640x480... omg so low
2016-02-18 11:38:38	stqn	sc2 works in wine?
2016-02-18 11:38:59	frankyboy_	perfect
2016-02-18 11:39:08	gnarface	slow, but it works
2016-02-18 11:39:10	frankyboy_	well, there are some issues
2016-02-18 11:39:30	frankyboy_	gnarface, i switched to wine-staging, also some gallium nine patches
2016-02-18 11:39:42	frankyboy_	and everything on ultra... 30+ fps
2016-02-18 11:40:03	frankyboy_	at least in campaing ^^

2016-02-18 11:40:35	frankyboy_	also in 64-bit wine prefix
2016-02-18 11:40:42	gnarface	yea at the beginning of the rounds its fine in single player
2016-02-18 11:41:02	gnarface	where it falls apart for me is in 4 vs. 4 ranked gameplay
2016-02-18 11:41:17	gnarface	towards the end of the match when there are very high unit counts performance starts to drag badly
2016-02-18 11:41:28	frankyboy_	no wonder lol
2016-02-18 11:42:29	frankyboy_	800vs800 units xD
2016-02-18 11:42:55	gnarface	hmm. not sure i've tried it in 64-bit mode yet though
2016-02-18 11:43:02	gnarface	i think last time i couldn't get it working
2016-02-18 11:43:12	gnarface	i got the 64-bit wow client working though, so it was odd
2016-02-18 11:43:37	gnarface	maybe there wasn't a 64-bit sc2 client yet last i tried it
2016-02-18 11:43:37	frankyboy_	gnarface, are you launching games directly or via battle.net?
2016-02-18 11:43:58	gnarface	i'm sure i would have tried both
2016-02-18 11:44:19	gnarface	but by default i launch via battle.net unless something goes wrong
2016-02-18 11:44:32	gnarface	i don't have them all in the same prefix though
2016-02-18 11:45:07	frankyboy_	sandboxed prefixes?
2016-02-18 11:45:32	gnarface	i'm not sure what you mean by sandboxed in this context, but separate wine prefixes for *most* my games, yes
2016-02-18 11:47:16	frankyboy_	when prefix doesn't have access to home folders
2016-02-18 11:47:16		[11:47]
2016-02-18 11:47:40	gnarface	oh, well i've removed the default mount to / they put in winecfg under z:\ if that's what you mean
2016-02-18 11:47:50	gnarface	but games still manage to write shit to my home directory anyway :(

2016-02-18 11:48:30	frankyboy_	just to clarify what i meant
2016-02-18 11:48:32	gnarface	so it might be a wine version issue i'm having
2016-02-18 11:48:57	gnarface	i'm always hesitant to upgrade because there are frequent regressions of course
2016-02-18 11:50:51	frankyboy_	well, i am keeping games not inside prefixes now, so it is not a big problem for me now to make new prefixes

2016-02-18 12:31:04	jcastro	yeah, trusty and xenial

2016-02-18 12:34:53	stqn	gnarface: any idea if wow 64 bit runs faster than 32 bit ?
2016-02-18 12:36:22	gnarface	stqn: it seemed to, but it was difficult to quantify.  i think it helped my minimum and average framerates in large crowded areas (like the Ashran pvp zone) more than it affected the maximum framerates
2016-02-18 12:38:33	gnarface	stqn: i'd expect similar performance gains from starcraft2 in 64-bit mode but like i said earlier, was unable to test it successfully
2016-02-18 12:38:33		[12:38]

2016-02-18 12:44:55	jcastro	I'm not sure what his plans are but I can ask
2016-02-18 12:44:55	stqn	I have WoW 32 bit installed at the moment. If I finally decide to play it and it runs slow I’ll try 64 bit.
2016-02-18 12:45:10	linux_gamer	stqn, 64 bit is double as good as 32-bit
2016-02-18 12:45:17	stqn	I was surprised to see a big impact for the 64 build of Talos in phoronix’ benchmarks
2016-02-18 12:45:21	stqn	lol :)
2016-02-18 12:45:46	drumr	phoronix is a benchmark to measure against and others
2016-02-18 12:45:47	gnarface	stqn: the old world for some reason is actually very fast comparatively.  you'll only really notice material computer load in the zones added by the new er expansion s
2016-02-18 12:45:50	gnarface	*expansions
2016-02-18 12:45:57	drumr	so in some ways it has become legitimate
2016-02-18 12:46:20	stqn	gnarface: I see… I have only tried the old world recently.
2016-02-18 12:46:43	stqn	And I only have burning crusade and lych king
2016-02-18 12:46:45	drumr	tough part is translating to compare to other benchmarks for equivalenc
2016-02-18 12:47:20	gnarface	stqn: it wasn't until pandaria and draenor that the performance started to get bad (sub-30's) for me
2016-02-18 12:47:44	stqn	gnarface: what hardware do you have?
2016-02-18 12:48:31	gnarface	stqn: admittedly very old hardware, gtx 560ti and a phenom II x4 3.6GHZ but graphical settings don't change the framerate notably
2016-02-18 12:48:45	gnarface	the game seems to be cpu-bound
2016-02-18 12:48:58	gnarface	but you said before you were using the CSMT patch from staging didn't you? that's supposed to help a lot
2016-02-18 12:49:17	gnarface	in fact it probably helps more than switching to the 64-bit client
2016-02-18 12:49:38	gnarface	because the game only is currently capable of using about 30% of my cpu

2016-02-18 12:51:19	stqn	I tried with and without csmt, it ran a bit faster with csmt
2016-02-18 12:51:40	gnarface	again, where it matters most is in the new continents, in crowded areas
2016-02-18 12:51:55	gnarface	if you're alone in the wilderness the load is pretty light
2016-02-18 12:52:15	gnarface	the cpu overhead seems to grow in direct proportion to the amount of other players are on the screen
2016-02-18 12:53:07	gnarface	(if i had to guess its due to them all causing a separate network connection with its own thread, which would be utterly stupid but there you have it, congrads blizzard, Intel must love you)
2016-02-18 12:54:58	gnarface	CSMT supposedly implements some sort of very microsoft-style non-posix type of threading mechanism, as i vaguely understand it, that mitigates some of the overhead of doing stuff in this really stupid and unscaleable fashion
2016-02-18 12:54:58		[12:54]
2016-02-18 12:56:33	gnarface	maybe it detects threads that are doing the same thing at the same time and collapses them somehow so you don't have to be smart enough to optimize the game itself
2016-02-18 12:56:51	stqn	no idea
2016-02-18 12:58:15	gnarface	i used to have a bunch of free 10-day trials i could give out i think, but they stopped doing that program so they all expired
2016-02-18 12:59:11	gnarface	now the base vanilla areas are free, with item and level restrictions, but i don't think will get you anywhere where you can test the game's max load
2016-02-18 12:59:46	gnarface	its all very dependent on exactly where you're standing and how crowded it is there

2016-02-18 13:04:15	gnarface	oh hmm. yea i may have actually had to manually edit the registry to add the serial keys that identify my gpu properly, because a lot of games failed to auto-detect it right without that
2016-02-18 13:04:30	gnarface	that is definitely important for several games

2016-02-18 13:37:46	Lightkey	well, last time I corrected gnarface on the DOOM 3 source, he apparently ignored me, better late than never :p
2016-02-18 13:38:08	gnarface	Lightkey: i must have missed it, when was it?
2016-02-18 13:38:31	gnarface	i was having some issues last week
2016-02-18 13:38:52	Lightkey	logs say November
2016-02-18 13:39:06	gnarface	if it was last year, probably i just had already passed out drunk then it escaped my scrollback log, sorry
2016-02-18 13:39:21	Lightkey	no, you kept on talking :p
2016-02-18 13:39:28	gnarface	i drank more heavily than usual through november, its largely a blur
2016-02-18 13:39:59	gnarface	but the new release of the doom3 source is not the same as the dhewm3 fork, or is it?
2016-02-18 13:40:38	Lightkey	and "give them time" won't work, they got plenty of time already because it was updated last September, not released, that was four years earlier
2016-02-18 13:40:59	gnarface	no way, they didn't really release the full source 4 whole years ago??
2016-02-18 13:41:06	gnarface	i find that tough to believe
2016-02-18 13:41:09	Lightkey	at least we have The Dark Mod
2016-02-18 13:41:37	gnarface	traditionally, they'd always released the mod source separately, earlier with every version of quake, before releasing the whole engine source
2016-02-18 13:41:47	gnarface	which means you could make new mods, but not necessarily full conversions
2016-02-18 13:41:49	gnarface	or forks
2016-02-18 13:42:06	gnarface	i'd believe that 4 years ago they released the source of the mod library, but not the whole engine
2016-02-18 13:42:17	Lightkey	why is that hard to believe? that's still six years after the game came out
2016-02-18 13:42:42	Lightkey	make that seven
2016-02-18 13:42:48	drumr	doom 3?
2016-02-18 13:42:49	gnarface	well, primarily because "why hasn't anyone done anything with it yet?" is baffling to me if its really been 4 years since the whole engine was open-sourced
2016-02-18 13:42:53	drumr	that came out in 2003 or 2004
2016-02-18 13:43:25	gnarface	and also because i really expected i'd have heard of it since i heard of the first 3 on *the day* they were open sourced (both the mod source and the full engine sources)
2016-02-18 13:43:48	gnarface	so something is weird here
2016-02-18 13:43:53	gnarface	did they not GPL it this time?
2016-02-18 13:44:37	Lightkey	the only thing weird here is that you don't seem to know how to google, come on
2016-02-18 13:46:12	gnarface	hmm. it does say its GPL
2016-02-18 13:46:48	Lightkey	as I said last time, they even released the Doom 3 BFG source three years ago, one month after the game, that one was genuinely surprising as it's not just updated id Tech 4 but a cut-down id Tech 5

2016-02-18 19:39:33	anonkun	is it possible to install dotnet fx for wine/
2016-02-18 19:41:26	qptain_Nemo	yes
2016-02-18 19:41:29	qptain_Nemo	use winetricks
2016-02-18 19:41:43	anonkun	winetricks says mono is not installed, even though it is
2016-02-18 19:41:50	anonkun	and some error about 64 bit not working for other versions
2016-02-18 19:42:19	qptain_Nemo	you probably should use a 32 bit prefix yes
2016-02-18 19:42:39	qptain_Nemo	also mono should be uninstalled
2016-02-18 19:42:50	anonkun	why so?
2016-02-18 19:42:51	qptain_Nemo	because it's another implementation of the same thing
2016-02-18 19:43:00	anonkun	ah ok
2016-02-18 19:43:04	qptain_Nemo	look up instruction on winehq
2016-02-18 19:43:16	qptain_Nemo	they're quite straightforward and detailed
2016-02-18 19:43:26	anonkun	ok cool
2016-02-18 19:43:32	qptain_Nemo	just find the version of .net that you need
2016-02-18 19:45:18	qptain_Nemo	successfully installing everything up to 4.0 can be a bumpy ride though, but i've managed it, it's doable. also a clean prefix with just all version up to dotnet 4.0 installed is like 1 gb :V
2016-02-18 19:45:35	qptain_Nemo	(tbh don't remember if it was 4.0 or 4.5 though)
2016-02-18 19:45:58	qptain_Nemo	*versions
2016-02-18 19:46:02	anonkun	dang
2016-02-18 19:46:33	qptain_Nemo	i just remember i had to download one file manually and maybe restart the process one time but otherwise winetricks did everything for me
2016-02-18 19:46:48	qptain_Nemo	also make sure to set the windows version to the right value that it says in the instructions
2016-02-18 19:47:04	AciD`	are you guys experiencing a lot of crash in spec ops the line?
2016-02-18 19:47:10	AciD`	(using amd)
2016-02-18 19:47:15	qptain_Nemo	and also ideally just use a separate prefix for screwing around with .net imo
2016-02-18 19:47:28	anonkun	ok
2016-02-18 19:47:31	anonkun	I made a new prefix32
2016-02-18 19:47:39	anonkun	how do I execute stuff with the prefix32?
2016-02-18 19:48:36	qptain_Nemo	WINEPREFIX=/path/to/the/prefix wine "command"
2016-02-18 19:48:51	anonkun	game.exe?
2016-02-18 19:49:02	qptain_Nemo	yeah
2016-02-18 19:49:08	anonkun	okay
2016-02-18 19:49:08	qptain_Nemo	well the command itslef might need a path
2016-02-18 19:49:11	anonkun	thankss
2016-02-18 19:49:13	anonkun	ofc
2016-02-18 19:49:21	anonkun	unless pwd is the game folder
2016-02-18 19:49:25	qptain_Nemo	sure

2016-02-18 19:52:01	qptain_Nemo	also i used wine staging. which i heartily recommend. i think it's supposed to work in vanilla wine, but i'm not 100% sure, see if the instructions on winehq address that.

2016-02-19 01:39:33	EddDeDuck	Shield != Linux gaming
2016-02-19 01:39:41	EddDeDuck	also this is a steaming solution
2016-02-19 01:40:14	EddDeDuck	So it’s a bit like saying uising SteamLink from Windows to Linux = Linux gaming
2016-02-19 01:40:19	EddDeDuck	Meh
2016-02-19 01:41:19	@Samsai	EddDeDuck, yeah, that article was a bit of a fail
2016-02-19 01:41:35	@Samsai	annoying especially with that bait he threw
2016-02-19 01:44:10	EddDeDuck	Also I am pretty sure the streaming stuff is not powered by any native Linux solution in terms of the actual games.
2016-02-19 01:44:55	@Samsai	it's most likely a bunch of windows machines that you connect to via the geforce thing
2016-02-19 01:45:07	@Samsai	just like that one game streaming service

2016-02-19 01:46:31	@Samsai	so... the games are running on a mutated version of wine?

2016-02-19 01:48:35	EddDeDuck	I’d guess so
2016-02-19 01:48:50	EddDeDuck	Nvidia bought that compaby for their Wine based tech
2016-02-19 01:49:02	@Samsai	i suppose it would make sense
2016-02-19 01:49:12	@Samsai	provided the solution works slightly better than regular wine
2016-02-19 01:49:29	EddDeDuck	I’d assume they use that and specially compiled Windows builds with specific settings etc to come up with a streaming system runnig on a bunch of Linux based servers
2016-02-19 01:49:55	EddDeDuck	As the hardware type is 100% known it’s likely they can tune a lot more
2016-02-19 01:50:04	EddDeDuck	No need to support loads of different setups
2016-02-19 01:50:10	EddDeDuck	you tune for just one like console
2016-02-19 01:50:28	EddDeDuck	This is all me doing 2 + 2 = 4 (hopefully not 5)
2016-02-19 01:50:39	EddDeDuck	So I could be way off I’m just joining all the dots
2016-02-19 01:50:44	@Samsai	it's entirely possible that's the way they are going
2016-02-19 01:50:55	EddDeDuck	and guessing based on my knowledge of all the systems in play
2016-02-19 01:51:07	@Samsai	it would be cost effective as they can deploy basically as many linux boxes as they want for only the hardware and electricity cost
2016-02-19 01:51:28	EddDeDuck	Transgaming use to do Mac ports
2016-02-19 01:51:34	EddDeDuck	*used to
2016-02-19 01:51:36	EddDeDuck	using Cider
2016-02-19 01:51:52	EddDeDuck	So I have a fair bit of epxerience with the system back before NV bought it
2016-02-19 01:52:39	EddDeDuck	If you’re tuning for just one hardwrae setup and are streaming to a device yu remove a number of the issues Wine/Cider has
2016-02-19 01:52:39		[01:52]
2016-02-19 01:52:57	EddDeDuck	which is it isn’t as good as being high quality on multiple hardwrae and card variants
2016-02-19 01:53:05	EddDeDuck	As every setup needs a different tune
2016-02-19 01:53:09	EddDeDuck	A bit like Wine
2016-02-19 01:53:15	EddDeDuck	which it is mostly
2016-02-19 01:53:31	EddDeDuck	It is a good choice if you want to use it for somthing liek Nvidia are doing
2016-02-19 01:53:48	EddDeDuck	as your port costs are minimal as you are making a custom Windows version not a full port

2016-02-19 03:19:44	bernard__	why not
2016-02-19 03:19:58	bernard__	and what if you are looking for a horny gamer that runs linux? :D

2016-02-19 03:28:31	Ysblokje	Samsai, we should do another TF2

2016-02-19 03:30:12	Ysblokje	Did you try to get a coredump and or gdb ?
2016-02-19 03:30:27	stqn	I’ll wait a bit more before changing my steam review to negative then.
2016-02-19 03:30:54	@Samsai	it's a crash somewhere in driver, that much we already know
2016-02-19 03:31:47	@Samsai	but the bug is apparently not easily reproducible so it's likely some odd state triggered by multiple semi-random things
2016-02-19 03:31:49	Ysblokje	so a debug version and gdb ;)
2016-02-19 03:32:25	@Samsai	i haven't tried going in without reclocking, might try that next

2016-02-19 04:01:54	Gallomimia	they should try this thing called "testing" before releasing updates
2016-02-19 04:02:25	drumr	or games
2016-02-19 04:02:26	bernard__	like unit tests?
2016-02-19 04:02:28	drumr	for that matter
2016-02-19 04:02:34	Cracker	It's almost like Techland breaks Linux on purpose
2016-02-19 04:02:37	Gallomimia	yeah
2016-02-19 04:02:53	Cracker	I mean, why wouldn't they simply click launch on a Linux machine to verify it starts before releasing a patch
2016-02-19 04:03:10	Gallomimia	not enough machines?
2016-02-19 04:03:21	Cracker	it only takes 1 machine to catch most of the problems
2016-02-19 04:03:22	@Samsai	because surely a 1.6GB patch won't break anything
2016-02-19 04:03:31	Cracker	they have had
2016-02-19 04:03:47	@Samsai	i mean, why test if it's practically impossible?
2016-02-19 04:03:48	Cracker	and that can be an existing machine, with a 40 gig hard drive, with Linux installed
2016-02-19 04:04:33	@Samsai	it would be great if techland fixed their testing and porting methods
2016-02-19 04:04:47	FutureSuture	I guess it's no wonder that Dying Light has not made it to GOG considering how often it breaks.
2016-02-19 04:04:55	stqn	maybe they tested it and it worked on their machine(s)
2016-02-19 04:05:23	@Samsai	right, good old "works on my machine, ship it!"
2016-02-19 04:05:58	stqn	I mean assuming they didn’t test it *at all* is wrong.
2016-02-19 04:06:22	stqn	Update dling at 250 kB/s so I can’t test yet…

2016-02-19 04:08:13	FutureSuture	Samsai, I can't tell if you're serious or joking these days.
2016-02-19 04:08:25	FutureSuture	Okay, I assume you're serious.
2016-02-19 04:08:30	@Samsai	yes
2016-02-19 04:08:46	FutureSuture	So Trine 3 is still being worked on and what not. Cool.
2016-02-19 04:09:04	@Samsai	they pretty much said trine 3 is just a part of a longer thing
2016-02-19 04:09:14	@Samsai	because budget limits hit them pretty hard

2016-02-19 07:17:06	AciD`	abp, but without the 'allowed ad' (which I always disable)

2016-02-19 07:18:18	@Samsai	some time ago https was living aside the http version but then https was made default
2016-02-19 07:19:01	AciD`	baizon -> "As of December 2015, uBlock Origin continues to be actively developed and maintained by founder and lead developer Raymond Hill,[11] but he has withdrawn his support for uBlock, citing "serious incompatibilities in the spirit of the project".[12] The uBlock version of the software has seen little development since." from the wiki page, not very inspiring

2016-02-19 07:20:21	mETz	unless the webserver redirects to https I don't see any reason for it being wonky

2016-02-19 07:21:56	mETz	And since over https one gets a transport security header a browser will remember that and open the https version even if you open the http variant
2016-02-19 07:21:57	AciD`	oh
2016-02-19 07:22:00	@Samsai	you need to reproduce this with Piratelv
2016-02-19 07:22:10	disharmonic	ppl still use apache? :O

2016-02-19 07:23:45	AciD`	yes, let's encrypt ! :)

2016-02-19 07:24:17	AciD`	certificate problems? that is a thing of the past
2016-02-19 07:24:29	mETz	not really
2016-02-19 07:24:53	mETz	easy to misconfigure a webserver serving the wrong certificate by accident
2016-02-19 07:25:06	mETz	also expired certificates still greet me from time to time
2016-02-19 07:25:19	AciD`	and the drawbacks you are refering to, I imagine server overhead, well, there is a login option in GOL, so fuck yes, I want it to be https _only_
2016-02-19 07:25:26	AciD`	pardon my french.

2016-02-19 07:26:42	AciD`	good ! :)
2016-02-19 07:26:53	@Samsai	okay, one browser is getting the http page by default
2016-02-19 07:26:53	mETz	but not everybody uses letsencrypt
2016-02-19 07:27:13	AciD`	whatever float their boat
2016-02-19 07:27:25	@Samsai	chrome, which i basically never use, served the https page automatically and firefox likely has already gotten used to the https page
2016-02-19 07:27:27	AciD`	as long as I don't input my password in clear text.
2016-02-19 07:27:44	AciD`	because most user don't change password from a website to another
2016-02-19 07:28:04	AciD`	Samsai -> try a private tab in both, and see what it does
2016-02-19 07:28:05	mETz	that's what HSTS should at least help with
2016-02-19 07:28:22	mETz	open site over https once => browser remembers that (almost) forever
2016-02-19 07:28:27	mETz	And GOL sends that header
2016-02-19 07:29:08	mETz	I think youtube is https only by now, now I have to view those silly ads all day :/
2016-02-19 07:29:11	@Samsai	in fap fap mode firefox does get the http page
2016-02-19 07:29:26	@Samsai	i suppose there is an issue then
2016-02-19 07:30:01	AciD`	baizon -> oh so it seems ublock origin acts as abp + ghostery combined, am I right?
2016-02-19 07:30:16	mETz	nah, the only fix for that is permanently redirecting any access over http
2016-02-19 07:30:19	AciD`	ads, which ads mETz?
2016-02-19 07:30:29	AciD`	never saw one for years, thanks to ad blockers
2016-02-19 07:30:37	mETz	I do that for a few private services, like Horde

2016-02-19 07:31:49	AciD`	that issue is easily fixed by the 2 lines I pasted previously!

2016-02-19 07:42:23	AciD`	well, you missed some tests then ;)
2016-02-19 07:42:26	@NaughtySquid	i think the issue is on that specific page
2016-02-19 07:42:34	@NaughtySquid	there's probably something someone included that isn't https
2016-02-19 07:42:36	@NaughtySquid	let me check

2016-02-19 07:55:57	Piratelv	It is on purpes that there is no redirect to the https version of GOL, there are a few people who complained about not being able to view the site due to the high strength crypto settings GOL uses with ssl. However once you visit https once the HTST header should force the browser to always goto https, as pointed out by the other people
2016-02-19 07:56:00	AciD`	which version, and card ?
2016-02-19 07:56:15	AciD`	I have a radeon hd7950 with 16Gb of ram
2016-02-19 07:56:35	mirv_	a 6950, and also a kaveri
2016-02-19 07:56:41	mirv_	(kaveri = apu)
2016-02-19 07:56:48	AciD`	and fglrx 2:14.201-0ubuntu2.1
2016-02-19 07:57:33	mirv_	played it last maybe 6 months ago
2016-02-19 07:57:38	AciD`	Piratelv -> well, for non technical users, you should then change the way the login works
2016-02-19 07:57:41	mirv_	whatever fglrx was around then
2016-02-19 07:57:47	AciD`	so it's enabled only on https
2016-02-19 07:57:48	mirv_	and mesa has only improved since
2016-02-19 07:58:46	AciD`	it seems it's a case of "it-only-affects-me" problem then :(
2016-02-19 07:59:02	mirv_	try mesa
2016-02-19 07:59:46	Piratelv	That would effectively block those people who can not view the https site from commenting on GOL
2016-02-19 07:59:47	mirv_	mesa-git is best
2016-02-19 07:59:55	AciD`	hm
2016-02-19 08:00:19	AciD`	so you prefer their password to float in clear text to your server, hum, interesting
2016-02-19 08:01:39	Piratelv	But last time I heard complains about not being able to view the https site was literally multiple seasons ago (maybe even a year) so I could look into getting GOL ssl only
2016-02-19 08:01:48	AciD`	it's been a while since I compiled my own apps :)
2016-02-19 08:03:26	Piratelv	NaughtySquid, That (^) would probably require a little bit of code change to make GOL actually use the https as protocol everywhere instead of the regex replace it's using now
2016-02-19 08:03:35	AciD`	even if I don't thingk GOL as any seo problem, did you hear that google (and co) are lowering the ranks of http website
2016-02-19 08:03:43	AciD`	specially if it's the default mode
2016-02-19 08:04:20	@NaughtySquid	Piratelv: where is it doing the regex replace atm?
2016-02-19 08:04:35	Piratelv	AciD`, I know, google does prefer an https:// url to an http:// when sorting search results
2016-02-19 08:04:53	Piratelv	NaughtySquid, I'm doing that in nginx right before sending the html to the user
2016-02-19 08:05:43	Piratelv	not sure if it's still needed, it's been there since gol began using ssl
2016-02-19 08:06:29	@NaughtySquid	well, we seem to get more complaints about non-ssl than ssl
2016-02-19 08:06:29		[08:06]
2016-02-19 08:06:34	@NaughtySquid	so i guess it's time to force it?
2016-02-19 08:06:53	Piratelv	I'm fine with that
2016-02-19 08:07:05	@NaughtySquid	me too :)
2016-02-19 08:07:23	AciD`	yay ! \o/

2016-02-19 08:10:55	sziszi	AciD`, NSA used heartbleed(like bug or smtg), it was super effective

2016-02-19 10:02:58	stqn	I don’t get the appeal for VNs, they are terrible. I’d rather read a real book or watch an anime or read a manga/comic.

2016-02-19 10:47:41	hidekin	von: Higurashi is also really good and also fault milestone. I enjoy a lot of visual novels , I really like the experience
2016-02-19 10:49:26	openfbtd	bernard__, you can't buy the game without it rather
2016-02-19 10:49:26		[10:49]
2016-02-19 10:49:38	openfbtd	But yeah, it's included in the game right now
2016-02-19 10:50:30	von	hidekin, I'm not really a fan of the genrey, but I have fault and will probably find some time to play it, yeah
2016-02-19 10:51:19	bernard__	I mean, I bought the game a few months ago and didn't play it yet
2016-02-19 10:51:27	bernard__	if I play the game now, I guess I have it included
2016-02-19 10:51:34	von	I highly recommend Katawa Shoujo if you haven't played it yet, as well as Juniper's Knot.
2016-02-19 10:52:28	openfbtd	von, uploading the vide
2016-02-19 10:52:28	openfbtd	o
2016-02-19 10:52:34	openfbtd	There IS a performance hit
2016-02-19 10:52:39	openfbtd	But it's not ridiculous
2016-02-19 10:52:50	openfbtd	And I've not played with presets and the like yet
2016-02-19 10:53:03	openfbtd	Just ran SSR with default settings for h264
2016-02-19 10:54:01	hidekin	von: I played katawa shoujo but not juniper's knot. I heard from dev that they don't release the vn if they're voiced to other platforms because they need to pay the  license the voices for each platform.Tood bad :-(

2016-02-19 11:00:25	openfbtd	It runs at 50+ for me
2016-02-19 11:00:29	openfbtd	WIth 100 FOV

2016-02-19 11:01:33	stqn	thanks
2016-02-19 11:01:41	hidekin	before the following the game run better for me , i think it's worse
2016-02-19 11:02:01	stqn	I think the 164 one won’t work on linux because it relies on the new filters thing that’s not on linux
2016-02-19 11:02:13	stqn	hidekin: yeah, here too the game is now slower
2016-02-19 11:02:46	hidekin	i was on average at 70-80fps before and 40-50fps
2016-02-19 11:02:52	hidekin	now
2016-02-19 11:02:59	openfbtd	D:
2016-02-19 11:03:02	openfbtd	Interesting
2016-02-19 11:03:20	hidekin	i tried on windows , it's also worse than before
2016-02-19 11:03:22	openfbtd	Like, seriously, I played through the base game initially in a 720p window with 80 FOV
2016-02-19 11:03:29	openfbtd	And it was hovering just above 30
2016-02-19 11:03:49	stqn	that’s a huge difference :-/
2016-02-19 11:03:52	openfbtd	I've tested it on GTX680 and it was ~40 with the same settings
2016-02-19 11:03:53	hidekin	when was the last time you played the game ?
2016-02-19 11:04:03	openfbtd	And then I played the following
2016-02-19 11:04:11	openfbtd	And it's easily 50+
2016-02-19 11:04:18	openfbtd	Most of the time it's above 60
2016-02-19 11:04:22	hidekin	oh really ?
2016-02-19 11:04:33	openfbtd	I disabled film grain btw

2016-02-19 11:05:05	fs0ciety	i gave up on dying light ages ago, works.. doesn't work.. works.. i just ended up not playing it after a while
2016-02-19 11:05:26	stqn	Or maybe it was a cpu bottleneck and they improved that. For me the game is GPU-bound.
2016-02-19 11:05:44	openfbtd	For some reason while recording with nvenc, my mouse movement is jerky :(
2016-02-19 11:06:01	fs0ciety	isn't there like only dev designated to the linux build of dying light, i think i remember reading that ages ago

2016-02-19 12:32:57	openfbtd	Heh. We have seemingly low taxes

2016-02-19 12:34:16	openfbtd	You know there are pastebins, right? :)
2016-02-19 12:34:22	fs0ciety	yeah
2016-02-19 12:34:22	pdq	fs0ciety: yeah, when all is said and done (as soon as someone creates it) eventually you will be able to but, not with sli/crossfire, something specific through vulkan will allow for new configurations not dependant on sli or crossfire allowing for multi gpu :)
2016-02-19 12:34:51	fs0ciety	well i hope nvidia get off their ass and fix broken sli in the drivers then. haha
2016-02-19 12:35:44	fs0ciety	i just hope with the advent of vulkan that they would improve that element of their drivers
2016-02-19 12:36:18	pdq	they probably will but i'm sure something much better will also become the standard
2016-02-19 12:36:44	fs0ciety	i guess all in good time
2016-02-19 12:37:00	pdq	the old method depended lots on nvidia and their driver and vulkan will allow for morfe middleware and developer intnroduced things like that
2016-02-19 12:37:16	fs0ciety	i've been meaning to download the lastest git pull of retroarch as it supports vulkan
2016-02-19 12:37:43	pdq	yeah i read that retroarch blog on their site, cool
2016-02-19 12:38:03	pdq	also icculus is busy as can be doing vulkan things hehe
2016-02-19 12:38:16	fs0ciety	ahh yes forgot about mr icculus
2016-02-19 12:38:53	fs0ciety	its all in good timing since that rememdy dx12 cames out in april. microsoft are probably like "aww shit"
2016-02-19 12:39:23	fs0ciety	not to mention a dx12 title you can only buy in microsoft apps store
2016-02-19 12:39:56	pdq	yep, the thing which valve forseen over 5 years ago happening, even though who can blame ms doing wha tthey want with their own game :P
2016-02-19 12:40:10	pdq	i am loving it i have had a perma smile since last august :D
2016-02-19 12:40:19	pdq	2014
2016-02-19 12:41:05	pdq	is a sign of their business model and a good example showing the distiction between closed and open business models
2016-02-19 12:41:05		[12:41]
2016-02-19 12:41:39	fs0ciety	well lets be honest microsoft don't sell software anymore just malware. haha
2016-02-19 12:43:01	pdq	they have been easy to opt out of my life, long ago :P i never was a pc gamer though till steam for linux came
2016-02-19 12:43:46	fs0ciety	i was pc gamer in the 80s and 90s. then moved to consoles in the 00s. when games started not being platform exclusive anymore i decided to go back to PC as a gaming platform

2016-02-19 12:44:46	pdq	it can be i suppose but why not more customers as possible
2016-02-19 12:44:57	pdq	is very cool seeing what is happening now though and all the comments in all these articles of people stating how they want to ditch that os and are embracing open/free software or at the least embracing something new
2016-02-19 12:46:36	fs0ciety	well id imagine for most people moving away from windows wouldn't be because of the open-source ethos but more for the sake people don't want such an intrusive os.
2016-02-19 12:46:44	pdq	is still for early adopters of course but this is like the final piece needed
2016-02-19 12:47:03	pdq	fs0ciety: true is why i said embracing change hehe
2016-02-19 12:47:38	pdq	ideally people whould have morals and ethics and society not based on lies and debt and people who vote to be ruled over :P
2016-02-19 12:48:06	openfbtd	I see people who switch to have a “better windows” as a problem
2016-02-19 12:48:17	openfbtd	Because linux systems are not “better windows”
2016-02-19 12:48:22	openfbtd	They are different to the core
2016-02-19 12:48:28	fs0ciety	i have win10 on an alternate partition but it is only for steam and thats it
2016-02-19 12:48:52	openfbtd	People who switch just to have a free and better windows are morons and detrimental to the linux ecosystem
2016-02-19 12:49:21	fs0ciety	i went to linuxconf the other week, amazing how many people with mac books using mac os x at a linux conference
2016-02-19 12:49:32	fs0ciety	was like "ok.. sure"
2016-02-19 12:50:08	openfbtd	Don't you know
2016-02-19 12:50:15	openfbtd	Or rather haven't you noticed
2016-02-19 12:50:19	fs0ciety	what?
2016-02-19 12:50:32	openfbtd	linux has been the latest thing for tech hipsters for the last few years
2016-02-19 12:50:48	openfbtd	It's “in” these days
2016-02-19 12:51:01	openfbtd	Expect more idiotic projects to pop up
2016-02-19 12:51:17	openfbtd	It's only going to get worse till tech hipsters get bored with linux
2016-02-19 12:51:21	openfbtd	And that might take a while
2016-02-19 12:51:26	fs0ciety	haha. most tech hipsters i see just use ubuntu.. and go "i usssseeeee linux"
2016-02-19 12:51:39	openfbtd	Those are the mostly harmless ones
2016-02-19 12:51:51	openfbtd	I'm talking about Poettering and the Docker crowd
2016-02-19 12:51:58	fs0ciety	oh fuck i hate poettering

2016-02-19 12:52:15	fs0ciety	im waiting for him to make a package management system part of systemd and try to make all the distros use it
2016-02-19 12:52:24	openfbtd	The ones who tainted the perfectly nice term “DevOps” to such a degree no one I know wants to call themselves that anymore
2016-02-19 12:53:10	openfbtd	fs0ciety, I made a meta-distro to escape the madness: https://fleshless.org/pages/spark.html

2016-02-19 12:53:12	PaulDana	heh heh, heh heh...he said "taint"
2016-02-19 12:53:34	openfbtd	And just waiting for this latest thing to blow over in a corner
2016-02-19 12:54:06	openfbtd	To be fair, the experience of making an rc and a service manager taught me *a lot*
2016-02-19 12:54:18	fs0ciety	you made your own init system?
2016-02-19 12:54:22	fs0ciety	i'm looking at your page now
2016-02-19 12:54:43	openfbtd	You can say that, depending on what you actually mean. “init system” is a very ambigious term
2016-02-19 12:54:47	fs0ciety	i moved from arch to gentoo purely because of systemd. 
2016-02-19 12:54:52	openfbtd	I have an rc script and a service manager
2016-02-19 12:55:00	openfbtd	I use suckless.org's init
2016-02-19 12:55:19	fs0ciety	ahhh.. this is actually amusing.. cause i look at a bunch of suckless distros just a second ago
2016-02-19 12:55:58	openfbtd	All suckless distros are basically not useable, unfortunately
2016-02-19 12:56:14	fs0ciety	yeah i know.. i've tried a few off them
2016-02-19 12:56:14		[12:56]
2016-02-19 12:56:18	openfbtd	Partly because suckless software doesn't play well with sucky software
2016-02-19 12:56:36	fs0ciety	i try to make my desktop environment as suckless as possible
2016-02-19 12:56:47	fs0ciety	currently on my work machine its all driven with wmutils :)
2016-02-19 12:56:48	openfbtd	I'm pragmatic. My meta-distro sucks, but it sucks less than Arch :)
2016-02-19 12:57:05	openfbtd	I have a wmutils setup, but use bspwm.
2016-02-19 12:57:19	fs0ciety	there was a huge mailing list thread on putting openrc as an official choice back into arch
2016-02-19 12:57:27	openfbtd	It was fun to code, but in the end not quite what I wanted
2016-02-19 12:57:33	openfbtd	I've seen that
2016-02-19 12:57:39	openfbtd	That's actually stupid
2016-02-19 12:57:47	openfbtd	Arch is flexible
2016-02-19 12:58:01	openfbtd	You can opt put of the base group and do whatever
2016-02-19 12:58:07	openfbtd	out*
2016-02-19 12:58:15	fs0ciety	ive tried openrc with arch.. it is tempremental at the best of times
2016-02-19 12:58:35	openfbtd	I'm fine with Arch's dev team supporting one solid base
2016-02-19 12:58:42	fs0ciety	just not systemd.. lol
2016-02-19 12:59:01	openfbtd	Any solid base, even systemd. As long as they don't make my life harder
2016-02-19 12:59:03	openfbtd	And they are not
2016-02-19 12:59:12	openfbtd	...making it harder
2016-02-19 13:00:54	fs0ciety	you know, i have no issue with systemd, its the fact that the deliberate choice of making things like gnome require it is such a low move
2016-02-19 13:00:58	openfbtd	The best thing about Arch is that, by design, the dependencies in the system are pretty loose
2016-02-19 13:01:11	fs0ciety	it just goes against general unix ethos, thats my biggest complaint
2016-02-19 13:01:31	openfbtd	So, even while it's a binary distro, it allowed me to swap a very important component and not lose on anything
2016-02-19 13:01:34	openfbtd	That is impressive
2016-02-19 13:01:51	fs0ciety	arch is amazingly flexible, great distro. used it for years..

2016-02-19 13:03:45	fs0ciety	how to be the most pretentious developers successfully
2016-02-19 13:04:11	PaulDana	like i care
2016-02-19 13:04:14	openfbtd	That crown is with suckless.org

2016-02-19 13:04:35	openfbtd	Arch is a close second
2016-02-19 13:04:51	fs0ciety	is third - gentoo
2016-02-19 13:07:21	fs0ciety	openfbtd: your website amuses me :)
2016-02-19 13:07:32	openfbtd	It amuses me!
2016-02-19 13:07:46	openfbtd	That's all that matters
2016-02-19 13:07:53	fs0ciety	that is the point i guess
2016-02-19 13:08:11	openfbtd	Well, it's also sort of informational
2016-02-19 13:08:16	openfbtd	So that's good too
2016-02-19 13:08:35	fs0ciety	well i'm still reading it
2016-02-19 13:10:24	fs0ciety	currently reading about hyperboria :)
2016-02-19 13:11:00	openfbtd	Well, if it prompts people to check out what hype is, that's also very good
2016-02-19 13:11:51	fs0ciety	well you succeeded

2016-02-19 13:13:34	fs0ciety	blows dust off my pcboard floppies

2016-02-19 13:15:36	fs0ciety	had to translate your job into english :)
2016-02-19 13:15:54	openfbtd	It's in Russian because you have to know Russian to apply
2016-02-19 13:15:58	openfbtd	And live in Moscow
2016-02-19 13:17:44	fs0ciety	ahh.. i live many countries away..

2016-02-20 01:22:54	linux_gamer	EddDeDuck, it wasn't an attack on linux
2016-02-20 01:24:01	DrMcCoy	Debian Unstable as well

2016-02-20 01:29:28	Smilex	To pass data to a vulkan programmable pipeline, you need a VkPipelineLayout, with a number of VkDescriptorSet, each adhering to a VkDescriptorSetLayout. Motorhead - Overkill would be fitting right about now
2016-02-20 01:30:15	mirv_	it's not all that dissimilar to modern opengl as far as I'm aware
2016-02-20 01:30:26	mirv_	think of a descriptor set as a UBO

2016-02-20 01:32:23	Smilex	mirv_: I know that there exist simalies, and that in isolation it's all just a little much, I'm just not interested in criticising Vulkan from that lens, or maybe not at all. I'll make this cool thing, show people the thing, and that's it. My interest in Vulkan is only curiousity and how the driver situation will be for Linux and BSD
2016-02-20 01:33:34	DrMcCoy	Coming from someone with a naive fixed-function pipeline OpenGL 1.2 kind of understanding: the Vulkan examples looked like pure gibberish to me :P

2016-02-20 01:35:37	Smilex	But I know the programmable pipline for OGL
2016-02-20 01:35:39	arnej	EddDeDuck: You could checkout the mesa git repo and build it yourself. You will need to tell the app you want to run with the version where it is though. I think there are two variables for that. It takes some time to set up but after that you can easily switch between versions with git checkout && make

2016-02-20 02:19:52	stqn	and on a side note, runs almost twice faster than Dying Light, while at the same time looking better.
2016-02-20 02:20:01	Ysblokje	ouch :)
2016-02-20 02:20:08	Ysblokje	havent tried to run it again though

2016-02-20 02:59:12	@Samsai	tumocs, about the tf2 crash
2016-02-20 02:59:16	@Samsai	i have three theories
2016-02-20 02:59:52	@Samsai	1. recent update fixed it, 2. pyrovision goggles are OP and tf2 has entered p2w, 3. disabling reclocking fixes the issue
2016-02-20 03:00:39	frankyboy_	neat... galaxy for mac... aaand soon for linux :D
2016-02-20 03:00:58	@Samsai	i set my card to run on minimum clocks and played the game for 40 minutes without a crash
2016-02-20 03:00:58	mirv_	it's been soon for linux for...2 years or something now?

2016-02-20 03:03:31	frankyboy_	hmm... when mac version was released?
2016-02-20 03:04:03	mirv_	it was a few months after the first windows beta
2016-02-20 03:04:29	mirv_	since version 1.0.7.xxxx

2016-02-20 03:16:32	Smilex	it used to be annoying, but how is it now to install Windows after having installed linux? In the past longhorn replaced grub, and then you had to boot into a livecd and reinstall grub
2016-02-20 03:16:53	qptain_Nemo	Smilex: windows even casually nukes grub during updates.

2016-02-20 03:24:00	@Samsai	if your mobo has built-in hdmi port your i5 can likely act as a secondary GPU

2016-02-20 07:07:27	Yamagata	It is indeed shiny, though very beta atm ( Ran intel and nVidia demos; going to try Talos later today.)
2016-02-20 07:08:47	von	that game can haz very impressive performance drops, I'm rather curious about any chance of improving on that :)
2016-02-20 07:09:25	Yamagata	Vulkan appaears to currently be a strudy but not amazing performance boost with zero alteration to the game for what is a totally different rending paradigm.
2016-02-20 07:09:28	Yamagata	Which bodes well.
2016-02-20 07:09:29	von	openfbtd, it probably wants you to feel like a horrible person, you monster.

2016-02-20 07:10:00	disharmonic	Well there's nothing really interesting to run on Vulkan just yet. Even, Talos is currently just using a wrapper. Maybe once Valve publishes the DOTA2 port
2016-02-20 07:10:06	@Samsai	dynamic lighting seems to have been fixed in the talos beta
2016-02-20 07:10:16	@Samsai	so radeonsi doesn't have those flickering shadows anymore
2016-02-20 07:10:51	Yamagata	disharmonic, Talos is using Vulkan, whether the Vulkan procedures are being invoked through function symbols that were already in the code.
2016-02-20 07:11:28	Yamagata	It behaves very differently from OpenGL so some of the abstraction would have to remain ahead of decomposition of many engine parts.

2016-02-20 07:12:25	disharmonic	Yamagata: I didn't doubt that it's using Vulkan. It's just not providing any benefits in it's current state. See the dev blog from Croteam for more info. They will fully port the game eventually
2016-02-20 07:12:43	Yamagata	Ah yes. It is providing benefits, just not anything amazing.
2016-02-20 07:13:14	Yamagata	That is a promising thing though, in that its current situation with Vulkan is like early builds of games going from DX->OpenGL, only it's running way better than things like that usually do.
2016-02-20 07:13:55	Yamagata	That it doesn't run at 1fps is a fantastic sign.
2016-02-20 07:14:11	disharmonic	Yamagata: I would think, they wrapped the OpenGL backend, but i don't remember for sure tbh
2016-02-20 07:14:31	disharmonic	-,
2016-02-20 07:15:40	@Samsai	in any case the vulkan renderer runs faster than opengl
2016-02-20 07:15:44	Yamagata	I would imagine they probably just replaced the implementation of internal render calls; that would be the most expedient.
2016-02-20 07:16:03	@Samsai	so if you can get your hands on the vulkan enabled drivers vulkan actually provides a better talos principle experience than opengl
2016-02-20 07:16:11	Yamagata	The word "wrapper" is something I respond weirdly to at this point since what most folks seem to think it is is unmoored completely from how code works.
2016-02-20 07:16:21	stqn	someone posted on GOL that talos / vulkan is much slower than opengl
2016-02-20 07:16:41	Yamagata	It will be interesting to see how it runs on Linux, since OpenGL on Linux is usually faster than OpenGL on Windows (at least for nVidia).
2016-02-20 07:16:49	stqn	it will depend on the CPU used too
2016-02-20 07:17:13	Yamagata	stqn, wouldn't be surprised at all if it was on some systems. The majority of benchmarks being "published" as it were, seem to indicate a good boost over OpenGL.
2016-02-20 07:17:24	Yamagata	Who knows what hardware will affect atm though
2016-02-20 07:17:51	stqn	Yamagata: you have seen linux benchmarks?
2016-02-20 07:17:58	Yamagata	With more CPU involvement, even things as simple as the same clock frequency but different speeds and amount of cache or switching of various tasks could make performance wonky
2016-02-20 07:18:03	Yamagata	No, just the Windows ones.
2016-02-20 07:18:21	Yamagata	Because of the OpenGL performance difference between Windows/Linux, I'm interested to see how the Linux Vulkan version runs.
2016-02-20 07:18:22	disharmonic	What i'm hoping is that porting from DX12 -> Vulkan will be really easy.  Someone should write a tool that can convert HLSL to SPIR-V
2016-02-20 07:19:12	Yamagata	I think that already exists in some form; I know that there are already compiler backends for spitting out SPIR-V, as long as your frontend can consume the language of your choice anything->SPIR-V should be entirely possible.

2016-02-20 07:40:28	Yamagata	Actually, I need to figure out if anyone has just packaged the Vulkan beta driver for Ubuntu; I really don't want to mess with the command line installer.

2016-02-20 09:33:20	Half-Shot	Vulkan has been overhyped to shit really
2016-02-20 09:33:28	homerj	screw a new API, 50 different things in the graphics stack have "enable vsync" options
2016-02-20 09:33:34	homerj	no one knows which damn one to actually use
2016-02-20 09:33:48	Half-Shot	Haha

2016-02-20 09:35:54	homerj	the OpenGL idiots that say it's slow, because they learned OpenGL from some 20 year old tutorial on the internet, and have so many glBegin() and glEnd()'s in their code, if you searched for the it would crash grep
2016-02-20 09:36:15	homerj	and they are going to try a new API that gives these idiots LOWER level access?

2016-02-20 09:37:39	nitroflow	And that's the only reason you need
2016-02-20 09:37:58	Half-Shot	If your doing GL properly, you should be doing a lot of your work in shaders anyway imo.
2016-02-20 09:37:59	gnarface	this is fun.  for once i'm not the angriest person in the room.  i like it.
2016-02-20 09:38:17	homerj	yeah, MS, "oh you want a spinning cube in Direct3D, here download this 30G 'SDK' "
2016-02-20 09:38:38	Half-Shot	gnarface, I alternate between friendly and want to rip your throat out.
2016-02-20 09:38:45	Half-Shot	Depending on if I've spoken to Raven
2016-02-20 09:38:48	Half-Shot	And if i've eaten
2016-02-20 09:38:52	@Samsai	and on the third day of vulkan the whole API was cursed to hell and back and everyone agreed that opengl was what we needed after all
2016-02-20 09:39:13	nitroflow	So say we all
2016-02-20 09:39:27	Half-Shot	Samsai, nah OpenGL is sinking. It's already at sea level.
2016-02-20 09:39:28	homerj	and now people are talking about backing some of the compositors on vulkan
2016-02-20 09:39:34	Half-Shot	We need to convert ALL our CODE
2016-02-20 09:39:37	homerj	you know, how about you figure out how to get to Wayland first
2016-02-20 09:39:49	Half-Shot	Why does a compositor need vulkan, it does fuck all work anyway.
2016-02-20 09:40:10	homerj	and nvidia, you're a billion dollar company, you can't seriously finnish off that EGL support enough for Wayland to run?
2016-02-20 09:40:27	Half-Shot	I'm running one, my gpu is almost at idle. You don't need to accelerate the desktop with vulkan, the speed benefits are useless.
2016-02-20 09:40:50	Half-Shot	homerj, I think they need to do some kernel work as well. I don't think they have KVM yet?
2016-02-20 09:40:51	homerj	what am I talking about, nvidia can't even make steam not crash
2016-02-20 09:41:30	homerj	Half-Shot, and they can't get on the ball with that?
2016-02-20 09:41:37	homerj	I mean how many YEARS has it been?
2016-02-20 09:41:56	sziszi	guys, sorry, but i need to paste a thing, and im in need your help

2016-02-20 09:42:55	openfbtd	With max — 30
2016-02-20 09:42:58	homerj	yeah, it's called "install KDE"

2016-02-20 09:47:33	openfbtd	That infuriated me to no end until I googled it
2016-02-20 09:47:56	openfbtd	It literally can not be disabled within the WM, you have to tell firefox to stop being an annoying bitch
2016-02-20 09:48:37	sziszi	openfbtd, where do you live? I owe you a beer
2016-02-20 09:48:43	sziszi	or two

2016-02-20 09:54:24	stqn	firefox is only bringing itself to front when it knows it will annoy me
2016-02-20 09:54:45	stqn	that is to say when I clicked in a window that was partially on top of firefox
2016-02-20 09:55:02	stqn	so now firefox has its own workspace…

2016-02-20 10:02:37	openfbtd	Youtubers are finally trying to shout at Youtube collectively about their copyright strike/claim system
2016-02-20 10:02:43	openfbtd	Too bad Google gives zero shits
2016-02-20 10:02:59	openfbtd	I'm 99% certain Google won't even react in any way
2016-02-20 10:03:21	@Samsai	youtubers have been collectively complaining for ages
2016-02-20 10:03:26	@Samsai	it's no different today
2016-02-20 10:03:47	@Samsai	everyone knows the copyright systems are complete bullshit
2016-02-20 10:04:45	openfbtd	The fun part is they don't have to respond
2016-02-20 10:04:49	openfbtd	As in... why would they?
2016-02-20 10:05:25	@Samsai	any response would result in a PR disaster so they don't
2016-02-20 10:05:47	@Samsai	if they say "we aren't going to change shit" people will freak out
2016-02-20 10:06:15	@Samsai	and if they promise to change it they will be lying and the freak out will be slightly delayed
2016-02-20 10:07:32	openfbtd	Which is what I'm saying. Google won't change shit because they *don't care*
2016-02-20 10:07:59	openfbtd	It's insanely naive to think they do
2016-02-20 10:08:02	@Samsai	also copyright holders would choke them to death the second they would change it
2016-02-20 10:08:48	stqn	according to mozillazine, loadDiverted etc. "Note: Setting this preference to True will still bring the browser to the front when opening links from outside the browser."
2016-02-20 10:10:01	openfbtd	stqn, well it seems to be wrong. As it fixes the problem for me
2016-02-20 10:10:11	sziszi	stqn, same here
2016-02-20 10:10:26	stqn	ok

2016-02-20 16:52:04	Gallomimia	wow. injected popups?? what a good reason to use a VPN to do all your browsing...
2016-02-20 16:53:51	Gallomimia	depingus: there's a provider in my parts that has the same type of pricing. and their competitor that has limits posted on their ordering page but never ever enforces them
2016-02-20 16:53:52	depingus	Yep. The data caps and the warnings are new, but the injected crap is about 4 years old. They would inject warnings if virus traffic was detecting coming from your home network.
2016-02-20 16:54:06	Gallomimia	oh. i like that idea
2016-02-20 16:54:29	Gallomimia	i've toyed with the idea of cutting people off if their connection is spewing out junk like that.
2016-02-20 16:54:30	depingus	the idea is ok, but if you have 1 infected client, every one else in the house gets the injections
2016-02-20 16:55:05	Gallomimia	if you have literally no traffic on port 80 thru their line, you won't ever get injections
2016-02-20 16:55:08	depingus	they are less intrusive now with the data caps then before with the virus warning
2016-02-20 16:55:08	Gallomimia	or spied on :P
2016-02-20 16:55:20	depingus	true. no injections on https
2016-02-20 16:55:41	Gallomimia	i've actually seen an appliance made by mcaffee that claims to be able to spy on https
2016-02-20 16:56:07	depingus	i actually don't care about that. i care about the data caps. Supposedly they were always there just never enforced. But now they're getting an extra $10-$30 a month from me.
2016-02-20 16:56:12	Gallomimia	at least, i used a network that had it going on
2016-02-20 16:56:23	depingus	my pfsense router can do that
2016-02-20 16:56:42	Gallomimia	https where the S stands for suck?
2016-02-20 16:57:08	Gallomimia	sounds deadly.
2016-02-20 16:57:40	depingus	i haven't enabled it.its super buggy if you try the non-proxy way
2016-02-20 16:58:38	Gallomimia	i had a friend who experimented with a caching proxy. cool idea
2016-02-20 16:58:46	Gallomimia	but back then a 2gb cache was considered big
2016-02-20 16:59:14	Gallomimia	anyway. shower time.. cya
2016-02-20 16:59:29	depingus	peace out!

2016-02-21 01:07:19	disharmonic	Anyway that AMD promo has among others SR4, Civ:BE and Spce Run if you have a R9 class GPU
2016-02-21 01:08:04	baizon	<3 amd
2016-02-21 01:08:10	baizon	free game if you got amd hardware
2016-02-21 01:08:21	baizon	... tool which checks it is windows only
2016-02-21 01:08:52	disharmonic	Yeah. I'll try running it in Wine in a sec
2016-02-21 01:09:44	disharmonic	Err, looks like the site is a bit overloaded atm
2016-02-21 01:10:07	baizon	ofc it is, i mean is a good free game

2016-02-21 01:16:44	qptain_Nemo	do they give you steam keys so you can actually play them on linux though?

2016-02-21 01:23:02	disharmonic	Is Civ:BE even available outside of Steam?
2016-02-21 01:24:45	@Samsai	disharmonic, the nice thing is that wine will quite consistently tell its running on a GPU that is completely different to what you really have
2016-02-21 01:25:43	@Samsai	might need to jump through the registry to get it to show as an r9
2016-02-21 01:26:08	disharmonic	Samsai: Well i'm going to check anyway. I'm just waiting for Wine to install .Net 4.5

2016-02-21 01:27:22	anonkun	My case wont allow my HDMI cable to connect to my graphics card
2016-02-21 01:27:24	anonkun	lol
2016-02-21 01:27:36	disharmonic	Samsai:  They also give a game for R7 cards but the selection is more limited
2016-02-21 01:31:36	@Samsai	disharmonic, yeah, most likely some windows titles
2016-02-21 01:31:36		[01:31]
2016-02-21 01:31:43	@Samsai	not really all that interested

2016-02-21 01:35:13	disharmonic	Nope, Space Run seems to have a Linux port

2016-02-21 01:38:26	@Samsai	but messing with wine is hardly worth it so they can keep it as far as i'm concerned
2016-02-21 01:40:08	disharmonic	anonkun: you can't cut it either?
2016-02-21 01:40:36	anonkun	I think I figured it out
2016-02-21 01:40:41	anonkun	I need a mini-HDMI to a HDMI
2016-02-21 01:41:18	anonkun	Makes sense
2016-02-21 01:41:21	anonkun	Also
2016-02-21 01:41:28	anonkun	HDMI is better than VGA in what ways?
2016-02-21 01:41:45	anonkun	better latency?
2016-02-21 01:43:23	PaulDana_	well it carries sound as well as video
2016-02-21 01:43:42	 - 	PaulDana_ is now known as PaulDana
2016-02-21 01:45:34	anonkun	And thats it?
2016-02-21 01:46:03	egon2003	VGA is analog
2016-02-21 01:46:22	mETz	dvi and hdmi are a better comparison
2016-02-21 01:46:32	mETz	audio over dvi was never standardized
2016-02-21 01:46:45	anonkun	Assuming I don't use the Audio from my monitor
2016-02-21 01:46:45		[01:46]
2016-02-21 01:46:51	anonkun	Would it really make a difference?
2016-02-21 01:47:09	mETz	I'd prefer DisplayLink though, HDMI sucks bandwidth wise and HDMI 2.0 which fixes that seems to be rare
2016-02-21 01:47:35	mETz	For DVI vs. HDMI it does not matter
2016-02-21 01:47:58	stqn	anonkun: in 1080p or "1200p" there is not much difference between vga and hdmi
2016-02-21 01:48:09	stqn	(I have a 1920×1200 monitor)
2016-02-21 01:48:13	anonkun	ah
2016-02-21 01:48:16	anonkun	okay, fair enough
2016-02-21 01:48:37	stqn	but sometimes with VGA the picture may be slightly offset or blurry and you have to press the "auto" button on your monitor

2016-02-21 01:51:50	anonkun	So then, its worth the 3$ for the HDMI cable?
2016-02-21 01:52:21	disharmonic	Well, it doesn't work, as it doesn't find .NET 4.5 for some reason. It requires a Windows install
2016-02-21 01:52:51	egon2003	anonkun:  definitely, better colors and you wont have the blurryness that comes with vga
2016-02-21 01:52:55	stqn	anonkun: if you have a vga cable already, try it
2016-02-21 01:53:06	stqn	the picture quality is exactly the same :D
2016-02-21 01:53:12	stqn	for me anyway…
2016-02-21 01:53:20	egon2003	stqn: sure if you are a blind person :)
2016-02-21 01:53:27	stqn	I must be blind
2016-02-21 01:53:28	mETz	exactly
2016-02-21 01:53:30	anonkun	I do have blurriness, but its only with certain text and I think it has to do with linux fonts :P
2016-02-21 01:53:50	mETz	colors are washed out, picture is blurry in most cases
2016-02-21 01:53:58	stqn	not here
2016-02-21 01:54:03	mETz	vga died more than 10 years ago, do not try to resurrect it
2016-02-21 01:54:10	mETz	it made sense for a crt
2016-02-21 01:54:14	stqn	don't be stupid
2016-02-21 01:54:49	mETz	indeed :P
2016-02-21 01:54:58	disharmonic	VGA can't even handle the res of most new monitors

2016-02-21 06:02:34	Smilex	well it's equally likely that bugs arise more often from devs using 3rd party libraries that they don't understand everything about, and the larger the codebase, the more likely that is
2016-02-21 06:04:21	linux_gamer	and the vulkan code/command base is short?

It has existed for quite a long time, and there still doesn't seem to exist a good way to debug it, also I spent quite a bit of time writing code for every potential error, but it doesn't matter, because the thing just crashes and I get a 500 instead.

2016-02-21 10:17:57	gnarface	Smilex: PHP *can't* even cache your javascript, unless your javascript is dynamically generated by PHP anyway.
2016-02-21 10:17:59	Smilex	gnarface: I might have mixed what I was talking about. I didn't have issues with PHP and caching
2016-02-21 10:18:04	Smilex	also this was running locally
2016-02-21 10:18:12	stqn	muhahaha
2016-02-21 10:18:17	gnarface	Smilex: locally... well that rules out the ISP probably
2016-02-21 10:19:02	gnarface	Smilex: there's some well-known cache-busting headers you can set but they're different for IE and everything else, so you gotta blast both, usually you can get through *most* types of "transparent" proxies that are misbehaved but still created in good-faith that way
2016-02-21 10:19:46	gnarface	full cache-clearing in older IE versions requires first having it disabled then a manual ctrl-r refresh *twice to three times* depending on version though
2016-02-21 10:20:02	Smilex	gnarface: God. I was just writing a local javascript file. What's up with all this complexity
2016-02-21 10:20:03	gnarface	(because disabling cache in IE doesn't fully disable it)

2016-02-22 12:27:39	gnarface	presumably, its fixed now, this is all aftermath.  their servers got hacked last night and for a while the ISOs were infected
2016-02-22 12:28:05	gnarface	its a cautionary tale really about using wordpress and phpBB rather than hiring me to build you something secure from scratch

2016-02-22 12:28:40	Marezz	gnarface, heya
2016-02-22 12:29:01	gnarface	did you install Mint last night Marezz ?  if so uh... lol delete it and start over
2016-02-22 12:29:20	Marezz	gnarface, i havent
2016-02-22 12:29:22	Marezz	why?
2016-02-22 12:29:36	gnarface	their servers were hacked last night and for a while the ISOs were all infected with a botnet
2016-02-22 12:29:48	fs0ciety	i thought their servers were hacked like a week ago
2016-02-22 12:29:53	fs0ciety	or did they get hacked again
2016-02-22 12:30:13	gnarface	according to this they were hacked *twice* last night

2016-02-22 12:31:52	gnarface	oh so it happened before too
2016-02-22 12:32:03	gnarface	people really should stop relying on phpBB and wordpress
2016-02-22 12:32:04	gnarface	sigh
2016-02-22 12:34:34	*	fs0ciety gets out vim and codes html5
2016-02-22 12:34:42	Marezz	Is there a good online tactical first person shooter for gnu+linux?
2016-02-22 12:36:56	gnarface	i wish i knew, sorry Marezz

2016-02-22 12:40:11	Marezz	some time now*
2016-02-22 12:40:38	stqn	ok
2016-02-22 12:40:41	stqn	I don’t mind
2016-02-22 12:40:46	Marezz	why? dont you like tactical shooters?
2016-02-22 12:40:50	stqn	as long as I can use just "linux"
2016-02-22 12:40:53	gnarface	its proper, because just "Linux" notably also applies to Tivo and Android
2016-02-22 12:41:05	gnarface	and probably a handful of other things
2016-02-22 12:41:19	stqn	gnarface: technically maybe, but we all know what "linux" means when we say "linux"…
2016-02-22 12:41:45	gnarface	Marezz: i guess i just haven't tried them really.  they were really popular when that Rainbow Six game came out right?
2016-02-22 12:41:54	Marezz	gnarface, yeah
2016-02-22 12:41:59	stqn	Marezz: I don’t like "tactical turn-based strategy" … tactical shooters… I don’t know.
2016-02-22 12:43:56	Marezz	Shame that we dont have arma 2 & 3
2016-02-22 12:44:11	stqn	well arma 3 is available in beta I think

2016-02-22 14:43:02	gnarface	sigh
2016-02-22 14:43:13	Marezz	why the le sigh gnarface? :)
2016-02-22 14:43:13	gnarface	i want CSMT in wine but i REALLY don't want to compile it on debian again
2016-02-22 14:43:22	gnarface	its such a mess
2016-02-22 14:43:28	Marezz	whats csmt?
2016-02-22 14:43:44	gnarface	a multi-threading patch from wine staging that makes WoW run a lot better
2016-02-22 14:43:53	Marezz	ah
2016-02-22 14:44:10	Marezz	well WoW actually ran amazing for me, without any patching and meddling
2016-02-22 14:44:20	gnarface	but you were playing the free version only right?
2016-02-22 14:44:28	Marezz	i had around 150fps if i remember correctly
2016-02-22 14:44:59	gnarface	for some reason all the new pay-only expansions' areas run a lot worse than the "old world"
2016-02-22 14:45:13	Marezz	i played on a private server tho, wotlk, your mileage may vary
2016-02-22 14:45:24	gnarface	oh yea, that probably was a lot to do with it
2016-02-22 14:46:00	Marezz	hmm
2016-02-22 14:46:00		[14:46]
2016-02-22 14:46:06	gnarface	the lag gets worse in the new expansions' areas, and seems to be worst around big crowds
2016-02-22 14:46:11	Marezz	gnarface, what are your 3 most favorite games?
2016-02-22 14:46:54	gnarface	that's a really tough one
2016-02-22 14:47:06	Marezz	hah :)
2016-02-22 14:48:24	gnarface	well the thing is, you can't judge it necessarily by play time
2016-02-22 14:48:39	gnarface	judging by play time it'd have to be WoW but honestly that hasn't been true for a while that its my favorite game
2016-02-22 14:48:43	gnarface	now that's more an addition
2016-02-22 14:48:59	gnarface	if i had to say, i'd probably my *favorite* 3 games are on Nintendo right now
2016-02-22 14:49:10	Marezz	shoot
2016-02-22 14:49:50	Marezz	which ones? i nearly bought a wii u ~3 years ago
2016-02-22 14:49:57	gnarface	Yoshi's Wolly World, Xenoblade Chronicles X, and maybe ither Splatoon or Chronicles of Mystara
2016-02-22 14:50:55	Marezz	man, xenoblade looks so damn awesome
2016-02-22 14:51:06	gnarface	its fucking great to be honest
2016-02-22 14:51:10	gnarface	might be my top favorite
2016-02-22 14:51:25	gnarface	but my GF likes the Yoshi's Wooly World the most
2016-02-22 14:51:28	gnarface	so that's the one i play with her most often lately
2016-02-22 14:52:00	Marezz	regretfully i missed all the good consoles
2016-02-22 14:52:15	Marezz	i only had sega mega drive 2(?)
2016-02-22 14:52:37	gnarface	yea but SNES games run great in emulators these days :)

2016-02-22 14:54:28	gnarface	now, on *Steam* my favorite game is probably Portal or Portal2, maybe Civ5 and Ziggurat being close seconds
2016-02-22 14:55:02	gnarface	it'd be easier to break it down perhaps into categories like "favorite game i haven't beat yet"
2016-02-22 14:55:12	gnarface	and "favorite game i'd encourage anyone to play all the way through"
2016-02-22 14:55:32	Marezz	gimme few of the latter onezs
2016-02-22 14:55:34	Marezz	ones*
2016-02-22 14:56:08	gnarface	non-specific to steam/nintendo?  portal1&2, every Zelda game from Windwaker onward
2016-02-22 14:56:45	Marezz	pc only, i have no console
2016-02-22 14:56:53	gnarface	well, emulators though
2016-02-22 14:57:00	gnarface	hmm. lemme think more
2016-02-22 14:58:44	gnarface	Marezz: gimme a minute to get back to you, my GF is demanding my attention
2016-02-22 14:58:53	Marezz	hehe sure thing
2016-02-22 14:59:01	Gallomimia	loved portal. don't think i quite finished portal 2 tho
2016-02-22 14:59:11	Gallomimia	most important part of those games is the sound

2016-02-22 15:04:54		[15:04]
2016-02-22 15:05:21	stqn	mirror's edge is great too.
2016-02-22 15:05:50	gnarface	Marezz: lol my GF recommends Rollercoaster Tycoon in absolute seriousness
2016-02-22 15:06:05	gnarface	Marezz: (the original, not the sequels)
2016-02-22 15:06:09	Marezz	gnarface, i hate those kind of games
2016-02-22 15:06:33	Marezz	whenever my friend mentiones citiy skylines i cry every tiem
2016-02-22 15:06:34	Marezz	xD
2016-02-22 15:06:49	gnarface	lol
2016-02-22 15:07:04	gnarface	well in all seriousness, Portal 1 & 2 are definitely top of the list.  those are must-play
2016-02-22 15:07:16	gnarface	Portal2 is worth beating just to unlock the co-op mode (new content that you can't play alone)
2016-02-22 15:07:29	gnarface	you like real-time Strategy, Marezz ?
2016-02-22 15:07:34	Marezz	gnarface,  yeah
2016-02-22 15:07:38	gnarface	like starcraft etc?
2016-02-22 15:08:01	Marezz	well i dont dislike it but i didnt really get hooked

2016-02-22 15:08:07	gnarface	there is the one game called Kohan: Immortal Soverigns that was REALLY good.  a compelling type of RTS that's squad based
2016-02-22 15:08:14	gnarface	and they made a linux version
2016-02-22 15:08:24	Marezz	i loved c&c generals
2016-02-22 15:08:35	Marezz	CoH
2016-02-22 15:08:53	Marezz	played a lot of lotr middle earth back in the dayt
2016-02-22 15:09:04	gnarface	i played Kohan and beat it and my only complaint was was that it wasn't long enough. i wanted there to be more single-player missions.  i could never get anyone to play it multiplayer with me, but it had multiplayer too
2016-02-22 15:09:11	Marezz	i always wanted to get into total war series
2016-02-22 15:09:20	gnarface	hmm. i hear that one is good
2016-02-22 15:09:23	gnarface	never played it either
2016-02-22 15:09:55	Marezz	oh also
2016-02-22 15:10:19	Marezz	age of mythology
2016-02-22 15:10:22	Marezz	loved that game
2016-02-22 15:10:37	gnarface	sounds familiar...
2016-02-22 15:11:21	gnarface	Marezz: check out Kohan
2016-02-22 15:11:44	gnarface	Marezz: i liked it becuase there was troop formations.  it wasn't like starcraft where everyone just runs into battle in a disorganized mob
2016-02-22 15:12:02	gnarface	Marezz: you could actually make a line, and make the troops hold the line
2016-02-22 15:12:40	gnarface	Marezz: or make them go into formations that were more defensive vs offensive, and set them up in little platoon/legion style groups with carefully selected mixes of heroic troops and ranged/melee scrub units
2016-02-22 15:12:50	Marezz	i love that as well
2016-02-22 15:12:55	Marezz	making op troop combos
2016-02-22 15:13:25	gnarface	its a pretty old game by now, it should run very well on any hardware
2016-02-22 15:13:25	Marezz	omg, also rise of nations
2016-02-22 15:13:32	Marezz	man i really loved those old games..
2016-02-22 15:13:34	gnarface	hmm. rise of nations sounds familiar too
2016-02-22 15:13:37	Marezz	bringing back memories
2016-02-22 15:14:12	gnarface	I'd recommend any Final Fantasy game if you like RPGs for the story line, but most especially #'s 4, 7, 9 and 10
2016-02-22 15:14:24	Marezz	i think that was my one of the most favorite games for me back then and most favorite rts
2016-02-22 15:14:33	gnarface	but one thing they have in common is the combat can get very repetetive and "grindy" which is a downside of any Final Fantasy game
2016-02-22 15:14:55	Marezz	lol final fantasy is so confusing for me, i could never understand it, what is it about and all. granted, i havent played their games
2016-02-22 15:15:07	gnarface	i know there were PC releases of 7 and 9, and the others should run in linux on recent emulators
2016-02-22 15:15:27	gnarface	oh wait, my bad, i meant final fantasy 8 when i said 9
2016-02-22 15:15:29	gnarface	i never played 9
2016-02-22 15:15:38	stqn	yeah FF is really strange… well not the first one, the first one is ok
2016-02-22 15:15:47	Marezz	btw, would you mind telling me something more about emulators? you can pm if its not allowed here
2016-02-22 15:15:50	stqn	for an indie game
2016-02-22 15:15:52	gnarface	the PC releases of 7 and 8 should run in Wine.  i think that you can get 10 to run in the psx emulator
2016-02-22 15:16:04	gnarface	(the PS2 version of FF10 that is)
2016-02-22 15:16:52	gnarface	Marezz: i don't think the emulators are illegal.  the illegal part is stealing roms instead of buying the game yourself, but its none of my business where you get your game roms.  for all i know your country doesn't enforce US/JP copyright law anyway.  *shrug*
2016-02-22 15:17:14	fs0ciety	ff10 in pcsx2 runs fine
2016-02-22 15:17:18	fs0ciety	even ff12 runs fine
2016-02-22 15:17:33	gnarface	Marezz: but you know, fair use even in the US grants you the right to use an emulator to play ripped roms of games you actually own
2016-02-22 15:17:45	fs0ciety	i use the pcsx2 emulator to play my xenosaga series of games
2016-02-22 15:18:33	Marezz	one game that stayed in my memory from ps, i played it briefly. legacy of kain
2016-02-22 15:18:35	gnarface	i heard the later playstation and nintendo gamecube emulator (pcsx2 and dolphin i think they're called) even can play games in higher res than the original console could, with out needing special data
2016-02-22 15:18:48	Marezz	i just want to get all of the parts one day and play it one by one
2016-02-22 15:19:04	fs0ciety	legacy of kain
2016-02-22 15:19:07	fs0ciety	thats a blast from the past
2016-02-22 15:19:33	Marezz	really a great game
2016-02-22 15:19:36	gnarface	Marezz: there's a few emulators that are in the debian repo too
2016-02-22 15:19:45	Marezz	also i hate ms for their halo bullshit
2016-02-22 15:20:31	gnarface	how you feel about puzzle games like the point&click adventure games like Myst and Monkey Island series, Marezz ?
2016-02-22 15:20:31		[15:20]
2016-02-22 15:20:33	Marezz	they hook you up with first 2 games then they want to make you buy their console, thanks but no thanks
2016-02-22 15:21:04	gnarface	or old Lucas Arts games that run in Scummvm like Full Throttle
2016-02-22 15:21:26	gnarface	man, Full Throttle... yea i'd definitely put that on the list of "must play games of all time" if you don't hate point&click adventures
2016-02-22 15:22:04	gnarface	you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel righteous anger, and you'll hate minivans for the rest of your life
2016-02-22 15:22:16	Marezz	gnarface, well i dont think i ever played those kind of games (click puzzles) but myst seems ok-ish
2016-02-22 15:22:54	Marezz	they dont seem like my cup of tea
2016-02-22 15:23:00	gnarface	Marezz: they can get tedious if you get stuck in a corner, but these days those games all have full walkthroughs googleable, so if you get really stuck its not like you can't just cheat by looking up the answer to the puzzle so you can get past it and beat the game to see the end
2016-02-22 15:23:17	gnarface	with those games, its as much about story as gameplay
2016-02-22 15:23:26	gnarface	but some people don't like "pixel hunting"
2016-02-22 15:23:37	gnarface	i felt like Full Throttle was worth it though
2016-02-22 15:23:59	gnarface	Myst may not have aged so well with time, since its so old, i haven't played it in a long while.  i re-played Full Throttle repeatedly though
2016-02-22 15:24:22	gnarface	part of Myst's attraction early on was the graphics were so visually stunning but i'm sure they'll look pretty dated by now
2016-02-22 15:24:39	gnarface	whereas Full Throttle... the graphics don't matter so much, its kinda comic-book cartoon style.  its more about the story and the soundtrack
2016-02-22 15:24:47	gnarface	oh man the soundtrack... i bought the soundtrack to that game
2016-02-22 15:24:53	gnarface	haha
2016-02-22 15:24:56	gnarface	good stuff
2016-02-22 15:25:34	gnarface	more recently on steam in linux: Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP
2016-02-22 15:25:36	gnarface	that game was GREAT
2016-02-22 15:25:37	gnarface	but short
2016-02-22 15:25:55	gnarface	and i would say if you're zelda fan, also especially haunting but only tangentially reminiscent
2016-02-22 15:26:07	gnarface	but i would say only worth it if you find it on a steep discount, because its so damn short
2016-02-22 15:26:35	gnarface	i payed 14$ for it when it was one of the first few linux games on steam and i wanted to be charitable, but man... its honestly not worth more than $2.50
2016-02-22 15:26:48	gnarface	the soundtrack is really great for a video game though
2016-02-22 15:26:54	gnarface	so if you get it, make sure to get the deluxe version
2016-02-22 15:27:03	gnarface	but don't pay more than about $5 max
2016-02-22 15:27:34	gnarface	Marezz: how do you feel about platformers?  like mario/metroid/castlevania type games?
2016-02-22 15:28:28	gnarface	Marezz: i got Shovel Knight on my Nintendo but its on Steam now too and i'd 100% recommend it to anyone who likes the "metroid-vania" genre of 16-bit graphics style platformers
2016-02-22 15:28:33	gnarface	story is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:35	gnarface	music is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:37	gnarface	gameplay is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:40	gnarface	they knocked it out of the park
2016-02-22 15:28:45	gnarface	but its not an easy game
2016-02-22 15:28:56	gnarface	not by any stretch of the imagination
2016-02-22 15:29:41	Marezz	well i liked super mario back then when i had sega
2016-02-22 15:29:46	gnarface	Marezz: unfortunately, there's a large blind spot with regards to "tactical shooters" for me.  i can't help you much there
2016-02-22 15:29:48	Marezz	i havent played those other games
2016-02-22 15:30:06	gnarface	if you liked super mario you'd likely enjoy Shovel Knight
2016-02-22 15:30:26	gnarface	its like mario but you get an attack other than "jump on stuff"

2016-02-22 16:07:59	gnarface	fs0ciety: i never played tales of phantasia, but i played tales of symphonia on the Wii which i've heard was very much a similar style of game and i'd absolutely add it to the must-play list, now that i think of it
2016-02-22 16:08:16	gnarface	fs0ciety: sorry, scratch that, i typed Wii but my head said GameCube
2016-02-22 16:08:44	fs0ciety	well its the first in the tales series
2016-02-22 16:08:46	fs0ciety	its on snes
2016-02-22 16:08:58	gnarface	fs0ciety: also, to a lesser degree gamewise in single-player quality but in a very similar thread for multiplayer quality, phantasy star online 1&2 (also on the gamecube)
2016-02-22 16:09:20	gnarface	pso3 they turned it into a card game, f that
2016-02-22 16:09:25	fs0ciety	i remember playing pso on the dreamcast :)
2016-02-22 16:09:26	gnarface	i'm not all about that
2016-02-22 16:09:26	fs0ciety	memories
2016-02-22 16:09:36	gnarface	oh yea, it was on the dreamcast first when i played it! i'd forgotten
2016-02-22 16:09:46	gnarface	then they made a re-release for gamecube that was 1&2 on one disk
2016-02-22 16:09:50	fs0ciety	i really do love that console
2016-02-22 16:10:00	fs0ciety	i'm itching for shenmue 3
2016-02-22 16:10:02	gnarface	it was a great console, i should have bought one
2016-02-22 16:13:16	gnarface	they still making those?
2016-02-22 16:13:16		[16:13]
2016-02-22 16:13:32	gnarface	that was an epic immersive RPG experience i'd loved to have actually experienced too
2016-02-22 16:13:49	gnarface	for the longest while it was on my todo list but eventually i gave up when i gave up on ever owning a dreamcast
2016-02-22 16:14:24	gnarface	years after they were discontinued, thinkgeek supposedly found a lost palette of unsold dreamcasts in mint condition
2016-02-22 16:14:28	homerj	I played Shenmue 3
2016-02-22 16:14:30	gnarface	they liquidated them at 90$ each
2016-02-22 16:14:38	homerj	called Warehouse Worker Simulator 2016
2016-02-22 16:14:40	gnarface	not buying one is my biggest regret of my life
2016-02-22 16:14:48	gnarface	not buying TWO is my second biggest regret of my life
2016-02-22 16:16:02	gnarface	(don't get me wrong, i've got PLENTY of regrets, but its important to keep perspective)
2016-02-22 16:21:39	gnarface	(and in case you were wondering, i'd have kept one to play games and the second one to install BSD on

2016-02-23 01:46:21	gkeen_	haha upgraded :D
2016-02-23 01:46:23	qptain_Nemo	Smilex: considering they have allegedly elevated the upgrade to w10 to being a necessary update, it might be impossible now
2016-02-23 01:46:43	Raven67854	Not impossible you just have to avoid about 12 or so specific updates and keep the auto updater off
2016-02-23 01:47:00	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: so you can still unselect it?
2016-02-23 01:47:03	Raven67854	Yes
2016-02-23 01:47:08	qptain_Nemo	i see
2016-02-23 01:47:11	Raven67854	It still downloads though automagically though
2016-02-23 01:47:18	Raven67854	takes up like what 4-8gb of HD space
2016-02-23 01:47:24	qptain_Nemo	:D
2016-02-23 01:47:40	gkeen_	one would assume there is like a way to writeprotect the directory it downloads the w10 update to
2016-02-23 01:47:40	Smilex	I think I can't get direct x because my Win 7 is too old, so I want a  few updates.

2016-02-23 01:48:15	Smilex	Or maybe I'll just get Win 10. I mostly just need windows for builds

2016-02-23 02:00:17	qptain_Nemo	does it enable you to play dx11+ games for instance?
2016-02-23 02:00:17	Raven67854	When it works it works as expected

2016-02-23 02:01:20	Raven67854	Don't know
2016-02-23 02:01:21	gkeen_	thats what i see people use when i check youtube
2016-02-23 02:01:25	Raven67854	Also don't honestly care :P
2016-02-23 02:01:41	gkeen_	well could be fun to try out :P
2016-02-23 02:01:51	Raven67854	Nothing involving windows is fun
2016-02-23 02:02:17	qptain_Nemo	well
2016-02-23 02:02:27	qptain_Nemo	i genuinely like using wine sometimes
2016-02-23 02:02:27	gkeen_	good point
2016-02-23 02:02:39	qptain_Nemo	but generally yeah i agree
2016-02-23 02:02:40	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Go for it nobody is stopping you
2016-02-23 02:02:40	Raven67854	Also

2016-02-23 02:03:44	Raven67854	Yep
2016-02-23 02:03:51	Smilex	Now I can play a functional solitaire
2016-02-23 02:03:56	Raven67854	Nobody cares
2016-02-23 02:04:18	gkeen_	Smilex: i had solitare running in wine in the 90s ;)
2016-02-23 02:04:34	Raven67854	Linux solitare has more cards
2016-02-23 02:04:40	Raven67854	Also looks the same as it always has
2016-02-23 02:04:42	Raven67854	Never changed
2016-02-23 02:04:53	Smilex	gkeen_: It's great for watching progress timers
2016-02-23 02:05:22	Smilex	Raven67854: The solitaire I got, which I think is GNOME, is broken, which was why I mentioned it
2016-02-23 02:05:31	Raven67854	Smilex, Stop using broken gnome stuff
2016-02-23 02:05:32	Raven67854	Also
2016-02-23 02:05:40	Raven67854	The Windows 10 solitare cracks me up
2016-02-23 02:05:48	Smilex	if you cycle the stack too many times, it goes away
2016-02-23 02:05:49	Raven67854	Video ads or $9.99/y or $1.99/m
2016-02-23 02:06:04	Smilex	Video ads!? No fucking way.

2016-02-23 02:06:38	Smilex	I laughed at seeing solitaire on Win8 have a premium thing.
2016-02-23 02:06:50	Raven67854	win8 has two solitares
2016-02-23 02:06:54	Raven67854	The old one which works fine

2016-02-23 02:07:11	Raven67854	Because fuck you that's why
2016-02-23 02:07:23	Smilex	I couldn't find the old one then. I used the search function, but it gave me Bing results
2016-02-23 02:07:39	Raven67854	win8 doesn't have bing search results
2016-02-23 02:07:56	Raven67854	Pretty sure you were using windows 10
2016-02-23 02:08:01	Smilex	My sister's Win8 laptop does
2016-02-23 02:08:15	Raven67854	Then she added that
2016-02-23 02:08:22	Raven67854	Because by default win8 doesn't have bing search results
2016-02-23 02:08:34	Smilex	unless they upgraded to Win10 without me knowing, which could have happened because of Windows Update. There's no way they'd do it themselves
2016-02-23 02:08:50	Raven67854	Well you see it happen
2016-02-23 02:08:53	Raven67854	Also you'd know
2016-02-23 02:08:58	Raven67854	Win10 looks different from win8
2016-02-23 02:09:28	Smilex	it doesn't have the Metro UI thing?
2016-02-23 02:09:31	Raven67854	No
2016-02-23 02:09:36	Raven67854	Also its modern ui not metro ui
2016-02-23 02:09:47	Smilex	oh then it was Win8
2016-02-23 02:09:55	Raven67854	Most people never used the modern ui anyway
2016-02-23 02:09:55		[02:09]
2016-02-23 02:10:00	Raven67854	So it'd just be a desktop
2016-02-23 02:10:07	Smilex	what's metro ui then? I remember Windows trying to get me to develop for it at some point
2016-02-23 02:10:20	gkeen_	Smilex: its the same thing
2016-02-23 02:10:23	Raven67854	Its original name before they changed it
2016-02-23 02:10:23	gkeen_	they renamed it
2016-02-23 02:10:31	Raven67854	They renamed it BEFORE the launch of win8
2016-02-23 02:10:34	Smilex	I used the search function in the modern ui, and it showed bing results
2016-02-23 02:10:45	Raven67854	Then your sister added bing search results
2016-02-23 02:10:45	Smilex	I think it does that when it doesn't find anything local
2016-02-23 02:10:48	Raven67854	Tell her good job
2016-02-23 02:10:55	Raven67854	No it doesn't
2016-02-23 02:11:00	Raven67854	It doesn't have that by default
2016-02-23 02:11:15	qptain_Nemo	tell her to use linux
2016-02-23 02:11:20	qptain_Nemo	:V
2016-02-23 02:11:26	Smilex	I guess she added it then
2016-02-23 02:11:26	Raven67854	What qptain_Nemo said
2016-02-23 02:11:43	Raven67854	I'm with qptain_Nemo on this
2016-02-23 02:12:12	Smilex	qptain_Nemo: I did change my mother's laptop to Linux
2016-02-23 02:12:43	Smilex	so they do use it
2016-02-23 02:13:09	Raven67854	Shame
2016-02-23 02:13:53	hidekin	my mother is also using linux now since I installed it on her new laptop xD
2016-02-23 02:14:04	hidekin	she even prefer ubuntu to windows
2016-02-23 02:14:12	Raven67854	hidekin, Not a shock really
2016-02-23 02:14:31	Raven67854	people that just browse the web, write emails. Will surprise by how much they prefer linux which stays out of there way
2016-02-23 02:15:10	Future_Suture	hidekin, same. I feel a lot safer with my parents on Linux. Less crapware e.g. toolbars that install themselves and the like.
2016-02-23 02:15:13	hidekin	It's also easier for non technical people to use the side label with the shortcuts
2016-02-23 02:15:24	hidekin	*side panel
2016-02-23 02:15:49	Smilex	one problem was that I didn't commit to it, and decide to install Zorin. Bad idea. It just got worse and worse over time. Now it has lubuntu, which is much better

2016-02-23 02:17:30	Future_Suture	Also, Raven67854, that whole security issue you kept mentioning regarding Linux Mint, was the recent fiasco part of your complaint initially?
2016-02-23 02:17:59	EddDeDuck	If I have to give a machine for internet emails etc then it’s OS X or Linux never Windows.
2016-02-23 02:18:12	qptain_Nemo	heh i was actually considering asking Raven67854 if he gloated about it just a few moments ago
2016-02-23 02:18:29	Raven67854	Future_Suture, what do you mean initially?
2016-02-23 02:18:36	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, I didn't say a word because its mint.
2016-02-23 02:18:39	Raven67854	Mint hates security
2016-02-23 02:18:41	Raven67854	Look at what happens
2016-02-23 02:18:49	qptain_Nemo	well
2016-02-23 02:18:51	qptain_Nemo	on one hand yes
2016-02-23 02:18:57	qptain_Nemo	on another hand the exploit was through wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:07	qptain_Nemo	putting security and php in one sentence is a joke to begin with
2016-02-23 02:19:16	qptain_Nemo	it's not like you can succeed at it
2016-02-23 02:19:17	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Again we go back to Mint hates security. Because only someone who hates security would use wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:18	qptain_Nemo	:V
2016-02-23 02:19:28	qptain_Nemo	hah, a fair point
2016-02-23 02:19:45	Raven67854	You can make php secure to be fair. But not if you use wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:53	qptain_Nemo	can you though?
2016-02-23 02:19:55	Raven67854	Yes
2016-02-23 02:20:05	Raven67854	Afterwards you'll be bold and probably have commited a few murders
2016-02-23 02:20:07	Raven67854	But yes you can
2016-02-23 02:20:20	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: "register globals" is no longer the default configuration.  it was *never* recommended
2016-02-23 02:20:21	Future_Suture	Raven67854, I remember you taking issue with the distro itself, but the recent fiasco seems to be all about the website

2016-02-23 02:20:40	Raven67854	Future_Suture, So ? I haven't said anything about the recent fiasco
2016-02-23 02:21:04	Raven67854	The recent issues with mint have nothing to do with my stance on mint
2016-02-23 02:21:08	Raven67854	It's just something that happened
2016-02-23 02:21:16	Future_Suture	I am asking if your issues were with the distro itself or the distro/team/website/whatever in general, that's all
2016-02-23 02:21:20	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: if you say so.i have hard time imagining it happening in any meaningful and long term sense though :V
2016-02-23 02:21:44	Raven67854	Future_Suture, The distro/dev team
2016-02-23 02:21:49	Raven67854	None of which has much to do with the recent issue
2016-02-23 02:21:56	Raven67854	So again I don't really get why you're even asking this
2016-02-23 02:22:16	qptain_Nemo	i respect their ability to make easy to use things but it's a shame they appear to be lacking in other areas...
2016-02-23 02:22:22	Future_Suture	Judging from comments, the team, specifically Clem, are very much at fault regarding the recent issues, hence my curiosity
2016-02-23 02:22:32	Raven67854	They forsake security for all else
2016-02-23 02:22:36	Raven67854	This is what happens
2016-02-23 02:23:07	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, But its not any easier to use than Ubuntu. And quite frankly Ubuntu has never had these issues :p. I just put Ubuntu on any new users machine. Fuck mint
2016-02-23 02:23:27	Raven67854	I give them a choice between Ubuntu 14.04/Latest or ElementaryOS
2016-02-23 02:23:32	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: fair enough, i just had virtually 0 experience with ubuntu

2016-02-23 03:52:12	PaulDana	in a film, even if someone else wrote the screen play, sometimes the film reflects the personality of the director as much as or more than it reflects the story being told. it is as if the director is the "author" (french autuer) of the film
2016-02-23 03:52:37	PaulDana	to use it in the context of a game seems sort of pretentious

2016-02-23 10:23:53	qptain_Nemo	wait a second you're getting more than 60 fps with vsync on? how is that possible?
2016-02-23 10:24:14	qptain_Nemo	or do the extra frames just get discarded visually
2016-02-23 10:24:33	stqn	vsync is off ingame of course
2016-02-23 10:24:50	qptain_Nemo	oh so the game thinks it's showing more than 60
2016-02-23 10:24:57	stqn	yes
2016-02-23 10:24:59	qptain_Nemo	right

2016-02-23 10:27:33	stqn	I did a quick test with Dying Light and the difference is slightly bigger, but it’s not a benchmark so characters are moving differently…
2016-02-23 10:28:03	stqn	anyway it’s a bit better with ForceCompositionPipeline than with Compton

2016-02-24 07:24:01	AciD`	I lived for many, many years hard reseting my linux box when something went wrong, and corrupting my ext2 fs..
2016-02-24 07:24:06	AciD`	then I discovered that

2016-02-24 07:26:45	AciD`	but I had to do it few days ago, because of a shitty written game : spec ops the line
2016-02-24 07:27:20	Piratelv	I wonder if that also works with a kernel level hard lock (vmware locks my pc ever 2 out of3 times I use it :/ )
2016-02-24 07:27:30	AciD`	(which keeps crashing, and not letting go of the controls)
2016-02-24 07:27:59	AciD`	Piratelv -> not enough free ram and a swappiness set to 0 perhaps?
2016-02-24 07:28:31	qptain_Nemo	AciD`: i can usually switch to a tty from programs that grab all input
2016-02-24 07:29:56	Piratelv	AciD`, Doubt full it's an ram issue (got 16gb ram with another 12g swap) I'm thinking too little cpu left for software raid to keep up with the i/o or pulseaudio
2016-02-24 07:30:54	AciD`	weird
2016-02-24 07:31:49	AciD`	I too have 16GB ram, but I manage to use it entirely some times, and with 0 swap ; welcome to kernel-hell-that-does-not-OOM-like-it's-supposed-to
2016-02-24 07:31:50	AciD`	:|

2016-02-24 07:41:07	Piratelv	They were disabled for a short while, but re-enabled since ubuntu 12.04. Starting 12.10 it's enabled but limited to but a few commands (sync,remount,reboot)

2016-02-24 08:39:10	drumr7	samsai there is a fix for that
2016-02-24 08:39:16	drumr7	i had similar issue
2016-02-24 08:39:45	drumr7	obs has a room on quakenet too and i believe the founder and some devs are on there
2016-02-24 08:39:55	@Samsai	drumr7, nah, there isn't a fix until OBS gets patched i'm afraid
2016-02-24 08:40:05	drumr7	i forget what fixed mine but i also had reported a bug i think they fixed too
2016-02-24 08:40:23	@Samsai	or mesa starts accepting behavior considered to be against the spec
2016-02-24 08:40:41	drumr7	or just not use mesa

2016-02-24 08:41:24	@Samsai	yeah, that kind of defeats the point
2016-02-24 08:41:45	drumr7	of course
2016-02-24 08:42:09	@Samsai	might as well throw the card out the window at that point and switch back
2016-02-24 08:44:34	drumr7	i used it with amd
2016-02-24 08:44:38	drumr7	obs that is
2016-02-24 08:46:27	drumr7	did you try their irc channel on quakenet?
2016-02-24 08:46:48	@Samsai	nope, but i did expect them to read their mantis

2016-02-24 13:24:09	calexil	Code needs to read a sensor input and send that information through a LoRaWAN to a cluster of lorawan hubs, the signal needs to include code detailing the location of the sensor ie:(geolocation).

2016-02-24 18:47:28	gnarface	Samsai: that's ... bad
2016-02-24 18:47:44	gnarface	Samsai: we're talking from comments right?
2016-02-24 18:47:53	@Samsai	nope, an article
2016-02-24 18:48:15	gnarface	Samsai: its not such a big deal if the only people who can submit articles other people can see are trustworthy
2016-02-24 18:48:44	@Samsai	i think they were hoping that their article is automatically published
2016-02-24 18:48:47	gnarface	Samsai: but if any random jackass can put executable javascript onto the site that other people can see... that's pretty much the definition of a XSS attack
2016-02-24 18:48:53	@Samsai	but all articles from non-editors are screened

2016-02-24 18:49:09	gnarface	Samsai: does it show submitted articles?
2016-02-24 18:49:29	@Samsai	the search function only shows article titles and links to the articles
2016-02-24 18:49:40	@Samsai	not even the tagline is shown in the search
2016-02-24 18:49:41	gnarface	Samsai: probably best to make sure that someone can't be sent a link to a search url that shows unapproved articles.   should be easy to fix if so
2016-02-24 18:50:03	gnarface	Samsai: some idiot could actually click on one of those unapproved articles in theory....
2016-02-24 18:50:40	@Samsai	none of the articles in the submission queue should be visible anywhere in the website unless you are an editor
2016-02-24 18:50:50	@Samsai	the search function should ignore it entirely
2016-02-24 18:50:59	gnarface	oh, so its only a vulnerability to editors
2016-02-24 18:51:26	@Samsai	and even them only if they decide to preview the article instead of going to the editor

2016-02-24 18:52:05	@Samsai	because the script shows up really nicely in the editor and would likely make people quite suspicious
2016-02-24 18:53:08	gnarface	i would probably just htmlentities() the whole lot of it
2016-02-24 18:53:16	gnarface	not let people put unescaped html into any submissions
2016-02-24 18:53:28	Sik	<Samsai> but all articles from non-editors are screened ← Question
2016-02-24 18:53:37	Sik	What if the script runs when an editor is screening them?
2016-02-24 18:53:43	gnarface	then the javascript would render as plain text instead of execute, and these script kiddies would just look like punks
2016-02-24 18:53:51	Sik	I.e. it wouldn't be to the public but could still be to GOL staff
2016-02-24 18:53:58	Sik	Oh OK
2016-02-24 18:53:59	@Samsai	Sik, the javascript would execute and the editor is potentially in risk
2016-02-24 18:54:04	Sik	Oh
2016-02-24 18:54:06	Sik	:/
2016-02-24 18:54:11	Sik	Well that's still an issue

2016-02-24 18:54:30	gnarface	there's a number of ways to address it simply
2016-02-24 18:54:30	Sik	...could probably just do a dumb replace of "<script>" with "&lt;script&gt;"
2016-02-24 18:54:41	Sik	That'd probably break any attempts to do that
2016-02-24 18:54:59	Sik	(OK, maybe do the same with </script> too for the sake of consistency)
2016-02-24 18:55:04	Sik	Actually, <script not <script>
2016-02-24 18:55:05	gnarface	you'd have to replace a number of syntactically valid similar things
2016-02-24 18:55:06	Sik	Point stands
2016-02-24 18:55:32	Sik	But preventing the opening script tag from being parsed would pretty much nullify the issue even if the end result looks ugly
2016-02-24 18:55:34	gnarface	but you could just replace < and > with &lt; and &gt; and then no html tags would render
2016-02-24 18:55:52	Sik	Well I mean replace("<script", "&lt;script")
2016-02-24 18:56:08	gnarface	but some browsers will even execute on "< script"
2016-02-24 18:56:20	Sik	The &lt; would make it not a tag
2016-02-24 18:56:24	gnarface	yea
2016-02-24 18:56:26	gnarface	safer
2016-02-24 18:56:27	Sik	Oh
2016-02-24 18:56:29	Sik	Derp right
2016-02-24 18:56:34	Sik	Spaces are allowed >_>
2016-02-24 18:57:02	Sik	<*whatever is the regex definition for whitespace here*script
2016-02-24 18:57:05	gnarface	also you could put in a number of arbitrary types of unprintable characters instead of whitespace browser would probably ignore during rendering
2016-02-24 18:57:19	Sik	I think that thwarts parsing though
2016-02-24 18:57:35	gnarface	depends on browser, you can't trust them all to follow the w3c specs
2016-02-24 18:57:47	Sik	But you can probably trust GOL editors to not use something shitty...
2016-02-24 18:58:15	gnarface	mostly browsers do a pretty good job of various types of "do what i mean" logic which leaves a lot of sneaky side entrances accidentally exposed
2016-02-24 18:58:15		[18:58]
2016-02-24 18:58:28	gnarface	so like i said, that's why i'd just htmlentities() the whole lot of it, and not allow any tags to render at all
2016-02-24 18:58:36	gnarface	*sanitized*
2016-02-24 18:58:49	Sik	Does it allow rich text?
2016-02-24 18:58:56	Sik	Because if so, that's probably why HTML is allowed
2016-02-24 18:59:09	Sik	You'd need to change the tags to something non-HTML to allow it to keep working
2016-02-24 18:59:09	gnarface	i actually have no idea what the GOL code is doing
2016-02-24 18:59:27	gnarface	oh
2016-02-24 18:59:43	gnarface	yea here, sorry this is what i meant: http://php.net/htmlentities
2016-02-24 18:59:44	GolBot	[ PHP: htmlentities - Manual ]
2016-02-24 19:00:04	gnarface	its a function for scrubbing all the data before the browser even sees it
2016-02-24 19:00:23	Sik	Wouldn't http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php be enough?
2016-02-24 19:00:24	GolBot	[ PHP: htmlspecialchars - Manual ]
2016-02-24 19:00:29	Sik	And not go overkill
2016-02-24 19:00:32	Sik	But oh well
2016-02-24 19:00:55	gnarface	yea, htmlspecialchars would be fine too
2016-02-24 19:00:58	gnarface	better perhaps
2016-02-24 19:01:15	gnarface	but probably just more pedantic

2016-02-24 19:02:09	Sik	Yep
2016-02-24 19:02:15	Sik	htmlspecialchars just does the bare minimum
2016-02-24 19:02:24	gnarface	the point is either way, it'll stop article submissions from containing any html formatting, but that's probably for the best, security-wise
2016-02-24 19:02:38	Sik	I should know because I always do function tohtml($str) { return htmlspecialchars($str); }
2016-02-24 19:02:45	Sik	(that name is way too damn long, seriously)
2016-02-24 19:02:52	gnarface	probably only trusted GOL staff should be allowed to personally insert renderable html/javascript into the articles
