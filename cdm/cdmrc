# List of programs, commands with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.
# If unset, all sessions in /etc/X11/Sessions or /usr/share/xsessions are

# (An example:)

  '/bin/zsh --login'              # or just execute your shell,

# Names with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.
#
# (Continued example:)
namelist=(':: bspwm ::' '::  zsh  ::')

# Type of the programs, one-by-one matched with $binlist.
# `C' for *C*onsole programs, which would be `exec'ed.
# `X' for *X* programs, which would be run with cdm-xlaunch(1).
#
# (Continued example:)
flaglist=(X C)

# Index of the first item in the menu.
countfrom=1

# Set default display.
display=1

# Where should the first X tty be spawned?
# special value `keep' causes to run X in current tty.
xtty=keep

# Should cdm(1) stick to the specified display?
locktty=yes

# Use ConsoleKit for X session?
consolekit=no

# Timeout for waiting for X session to register with ConsoleKit.
cktimeout=30

# Additional arguments to pass to X server, which is usually called as:
#   /usr/bin/X :$display "${serverargs[@]}" vt$((xtty+display))
# Arguments with whitespaces should be quoted or escaped.
serverargs=(-nolisten tcp)

# Alternative method of calling startx(/setsid). Should only be set if cdm
# does not start X as expected (bash -x shows call to setsid startx, but for
# no apparent reason does not start X).
# Only provided in the hope it may be useful, not a guaranteed fix.
altstartx=yes

# "default" selection if you just press enter or space
#
default=1

# "timeout" in seconds to automatically run "default" program from the 
# program list binlist
#
# 0 means no "timeout" so no "default" selection
timeout=0

# CAUTION!!!
# This option will overwrite your ~/.xinitrc
# 
# It will generate a new ~/.xinitrc from an specified "xinitcommon" script 
# and execute startx to launch it
#
# The process is simple, it will use the "xinitcommon" specified file
# to create a new ~/.xinitrc with an extra line at the end 
# "exec binlist[selected]"
#
# So, you only have to provide a common .xinitrc script that configures
# everything but doesn't start X
#
# Undeclared or blank means not to use this option
#
# Example: xinitcommon=~/.xinitrc.cdm
xinitcommon=

# To not redirect the X output to /dev/null
verbose=no
